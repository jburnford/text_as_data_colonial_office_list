FALKLAND ISLANDS AND DEPENDENCIES

Area

The Falkland Islands, situated in the South Atlantic, lie some 480 miles north-east of Cape Horn. The numerous islands of which they are composed cover 4,618 square miles. There are
two groups of Dependencies: (a) South Georgia, 800 miles to the east of the Falklands, together with South Orkney and South Sandwich, which lie 450 miles to the south-west and south-east respectively of South Georgia; (b) South Shetland and Graham Land, the most northerly point of the former being some 500 miles south of the Falklands.

Population

A census was held on 31st March, 1953, and the population, excluding Dependencies, was 2,230, there being rather more males than females. All were of European descent and most were British. The population of the Dependencies is estimated at 1,400 in the summer whaling season, with rather less than half that number during the winter.

Geographical Features

There are two large islands, the East and West Falklands, and numerous smaller islands. The coastline is deeply indented and affords several good anchorages. The surface everywhere, except in Lafonia, is hilly, the maximum height being reached in the West Falkland where Mount Adam rises to 2,315 feet. There are no large inland waters. A feature of the treeless, moorland scenery is the "stone runs", long "rivers" of angular, quartzite boulders. The island of South Georgia in the Dependencies is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, and the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea.

Climate

The islands are in the same latitude south as London is north but, apart from hours of sunshine which are almost identical, there is little similarity of climate. The islands are frequently, and in summer particularly, swept by high winds which some people from the United Kingdom find trying. The average winter and summer temperatures are a good deal lower than Kew. The climatic figures for Stanley are:

- Mean annual temperature: 43°
- Mean annual maximum: 70°
- Mean annual minimum: 19°
- Mean annual wind speed: 15 knots.
- Mean annual rainfall: 30 inches.

The Dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

Principal Town

Stanley, the capital, population 1,135, is the only town. In the Camp, the countryside other than Stanley, the largest settlement is at Darwin where there are some 100 residents.

History

The Falklands are said to have been discovered by Davis in 1592 and were apparently visited by Hawkins in 1594. On the other hand it is claimed by some historians that Vespucci was in the Falklands in 1502. In 1764 de Bougainville established a small Colony at Port Louis in the East Falkland. This French settlement was taken over by Spain in 1766 on the promised payment of a sum said to have amounted to £24,000. In 1765 Captain Byron took possession of the West Falkland and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. This action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the British garrison in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774.

In 1820 the Republic of Buenos Aires established a settlement in the East Falkland at Soledad (Port Louis) which was destroyed in 1831 as a reprisal for interference with American sealers by the U.S. warship Lexington.

In 1833 the occupation of the islands was resumed by the British Government. Until 1843 they were under the charge of naval officers engaged in making surveys. In 1843 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis; but in order to obtain a better anchorage, they were later moved to Port William, where the settlement was named Stanley. The Colony received regular grants-in-aid from 1841 until 1880, and for a mail service until 1884–85, since when the Colony has been self-supporting. The development of the Colony has been closely linked with the growth of the Falkland Islands Company, the largest landowner and trading company, formed in 1851.

Of the Dependencies, South Georgia and the South Sandwich group were discovered in 1775 by Captain Cook who took possession of them for Britain. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain W. Smith in 1819 and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821. Graham Land was discovered by Captain Bransfield in 1829 and taken possession of for Great Britain by John Biscoe in 1832.

Constitution

The Government is administered by a Governor aided by an Executive Council which is composed of three ex officio members, one appointed official, and three nominated unofficial members; and a Legislative Council composed of three ex officio, four elected, two nominated unofficial and two nominated official members. The present Constitution became effective on 1st January, 1949.

There is a Town Council for Stanley.

Land Policy

All the land is held freehold and mostly by a very few large farms. Certain areas are Crown reserves.

Taxation

Direct taxation is in the form of income tax, individuals paying a graduated tax, ranging from 1s. in every £ of the first £100 of taxable income to 3s. 6d. in every £ exceeding £850. Companies pay a flat rate of 3s. 6d. in the £. In 1949 an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom for the avoidance of double taxation.

There is no general Customs tariff, import duties being confined to liquor, tobacco and matches. Export duties are levied on wool, tallow, guano, hides and skins, and whale and seal oil.

(b) Approved estimate.

In 1952–53 the main source of revenue for the Colony was Internal Revenue, £248,000. The main heads of expenditure were Public Works, £41,000, Colonial Development and Welfare, £16,759 and Extraordinary Expenditure, £105,000.

In the same year the main sources of revenue for the Dependencies were Customs, £90,000 and Internal Revenue, £54,000. The main heads of expenditure were the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey research vessel John Biscoe, £77,000, and F.I.D.S. Bases, £50,000.

There is no Public Debt.

Currency

The currency is British coinage and local £5, £1 and 10s. notes which are interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

The Colony received an allocation of £150,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year programme. In 1950 the plan was revised and it is now proposed to spend about £265,000 between 1950 and 1956. The money is to be found from the following sources:

- Colonial Development and Welfare Grant: £160,000
- Falkland Islands Revenue: £105,586

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- Basic Services: £110,736
- Social Services: £98,350
- Productive Services: £56,500

Basic Services.—17% of the total will be spent on buildings and 34% on roads.

Social Services.—40% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 33% on general education.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation has built a refrigeration plant at Ajax Bay on the East Falkland. It commenced operations in 1953.

Education

In 1953 there were 360 children of school age in the Colony. There is no system of higher education and no advanced secondary education. In Stanley the Government schools cater adequately for children between the ages of five and fourteen, though a number stay until their sixteenth year and, in most subjects, reach General Certificate of Education standard. Outside Stanley, education is carried on either in settlement schools, some of which are very small, or by itinerant teachers. Attendance at school in the Camp is compulsory where there is a settlement school or where a travelling teacher calls. In 1953 a maximum of 17 teachers were employed among the 185 children outside Stanley, but, owing to the remoteness of some houses, there were still 20% of Camp children receiving no education at all.

The Colony awards up to two scholarships annually to boarding grammar schools in Dorset, tenable by children with Falkland Islands parents. Four scholars are in England at present.

The cost of education in 1952–53 was £8,350 compared with £2,877 in 1935.

Libraries

There are two lending libraries in Stanley operated by the Town Council and the Falkland Islands Company respectively.

Health

The commoner ailments in the Colony are the common cold, naso-pharyngitis, bronchitis, gastro-enteritis and rheumatism in its chronic form. The incidence of tuberculosis is higher than in the United Kingdom.

There is one General Hospital in Stanley. An extension to the hospital, the Churchill Wing, was completed in 1953. The Colony has now a modern, well-equipped hospital, with 32 beds.

The Government Medical Department employs one Senior Medical Officer and three Medical Officers, one of whom is in Stanley, one at Darwin, in Lafonia, and the third at Fox Bay, in the West Falkland. A Tuberculosis Officer has been employed since September, 1953, and is engaged in a tuberculosis survey of the Falklands. The nursing staff of the Hospital consists of the Matron, four Nursing Sisters and six Nurses.

There are two Government-employed dentists in the Colony. One is stationed in Stanley, the other works wholly in the Camp.

The Government Air Service is used extensively for medical transport to and from Stanley. The m.v. Philomel is also at the disposal of the Medical Department for use when the weather does not permit the use of the aircraft.

Expenditure on the Medical Department in 1952–53 was £12,806. In 1935 the sum spent was £5,225.

Communications

Communication between the Colony and the mainland of South America is maintained by the Falkland Islands Company's vessel S.S. Fitzroy which runs a mail and passenger service at least ten times a year to Montevideo. Internal communications are maintained by sea with the Government-owned Philomel, the Fitzroy and a few small private vessels. There is also a small Government-owned air service. Travellers generally use horses when moving from one settlement to another on the mainland. South Georgia is served by vessels engaged in the whaling industry and the R.R.S. John Biscoe calls there and elsewhere in the Dependencies during the southern summer. There are no roads, except in Stanley, and no inland waterway or rail services.

Broadcasting

The Government runs a broadcasting station at Stanley, operating on 6,125 and 580 kc/s, with a power of 0·25 kW and 0·5 kW respectively. In 1953 there were 361 wireless licence holders in the Colony. Government also operates a re-diffusion service in Stanley which in 1953 had 261 subscribers. There is also a Government wireless station on the West Falkland to which most of the farms are linked by telephone. The East Falkland...
has telephone facilities similar to those on the West. Government operates an inter-island radio-telephone service and daily communication is maintained with Stanley.

**Principal Occupations**

In the Camp the main occupation is sheep-farming, though a number of men are engaged on the maintenance of the Colonial Development Corporation's refrigerator plant. In Stanley the population is employed on Government and public services, trading and shipping. The population is almost equally divided between Stanley and the Camp. Local labour is organized in the Falkland Islands Labour Federation which has a 90% membership of eligible labour.

**Main Crops and Products**

There is no agriculture in the Colony other than a very small acreage of oats grown for hay. Householders in Stanley and the Camp grow their own vegetables. There are no minerals and the only manufactured product is a small quantity of tallow. The principal products are wool, whale meal, whale oil, other whale products and seal oil. In 1953, 3,957,819 lb. of wool, 19,924,356 lb. of whale meal, 3,710 barrels of seal oil and 132,341 barrels of whale oil were produced.
