KENYA

Area

The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East African Protectorate, includes parts of the great African Lakes, Victoria and Rudolf; the land area is approximately 219,730 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 224,960 square miles.

Population

At 1st July, 1954, the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at over 5·9 million persons, of whom over 5·7 million
were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe    | Per cent. |
|----------|-----------|
| Kikuyu   | 19·5      |
| Luo      | 14·4      |
| Baluhya  | 12·5      |
| Kamba    | 11·7      |
| Meru     | 6·2       |
| Nyika    | 5·6       |

The 1948 census showed a total non-African population of 154,846 of whom 90,528 were Indians, 29,660 Europeans and 24,174 Arabs. The non-African population at the middle of 1954 has been estimated at 220,000.

Geographical Features

Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Tetta Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Kulai, 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,040 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,120). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30–40 miles wide and 2,000–3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

Climate

The climate varies greatly. Three broad divisions exist:

1. The coast and its immediate hinterland;
2. The low plain, 300–2,000 feet, extending from the borders of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to the boundary of Tanganyika.
3. The Highlands, 3,000–10,000 feet.

History

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1923, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1947 which supersedes the original agreement of 1908.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which a rent of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution

Under additional Royal Instructions dated the 13th of April, 1954, there was set up a Council of Ministers, consisting of the Deputy Governor,
the Chief Secretary, the Minister for Legal Affairs, the Minister for Finance and Development, the Minister for African Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Water Resources, the Minister for Internal Security and Defence, the Minister for Local Government, Health and Housing, the Minister for Education, Labour and Lands, the Minister for Forest Development, Game and Fisheries, the Minister for Commerce and Industry, the Minister for Works, the Minister for Community Development, a European Minister without portfolio and an Asian Minister without portfolio.

The Executive Council consists of the Ministers and such other persons, who are styled Appointed Members, as may be appointed by the Governor. There are at present three such Appointed Members, two being African and one Arab.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor who is President, a Vice-President who is Speaker and 54 Members of whom eight are ex officio Ministers, 18 Nominated Members (who all accept the Government whip on major issues of policy), 14 European Elected Members (of whom three have ministerial functions), six Asian Elected Members (of whom two have ministerial functions and one is a Parliamentary Secretary), one Arab Elected Member, six African Representative Members (of whom one has ministerial functions and one is a Parliamentary Secretary) and one Arab Representative Member (who is also a Parliamentary Secretary).

In the East African Central Legislative Assembly Kenya is represented by one Official and four Unofficial Members, two of the latter being European, one Asian, and one African.

By the Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Nyeri and various other places.

A General Election was held in 1952 for the constituencies established by the Legislative Council (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1951. This Ordinance defined the boundaries of the 14 European Electoral Areas, the six Asian and the one Arab Electoral Areas. The six African Representative members were appointed from among the three names submitted by each of the electoral colleges set up in each of six areas of the Colony.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by non-African Local Authorities. There are now 24 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local legislation regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. The Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, enables District Councils in the settled areas to prepare schemes for organizing the local government of their area into a County Council.

In October, 1952, a State of Emergency was declared in Kenya. The Government then assumed special powers in order to maintain law and order in the face of a campaign of violence and barbarous atrocity engineered, principally amongst the Kikuyu, by the Mau Mau secret society. The Government, aided by the Security Forces, which include the Kenya Police Reserve and the Kikuyu Home Guard, as well as by United Kingdom troops under the command of General Sir George Erskine, is making strenuous efforts to stamp out terrorism. In May, 1953, Sir Frederick Crawford was appointed to the post of Deputy Governor in order to lighten the administrative burden falling upon the Governor as a result of the Emergency.

Land Policy

All land in Kenya falls into one of two categories:

(a) Crown lands.
(b) Native lands.

"Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

"Native lands" are permanently reserved for Africans in so far as the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of the land are concerned and all the rights enjoyed under native laws and custom are preserved.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township or native reserve, may be alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

Taxation

The forms of direct taxation are: income tax, which applies to all members of the community; personal tax, which applies to Europeans and Asians; poll tax, which applies to Africans, and hospital tax contribution, which applies to Europeans. Under the Income Tax Law generous personal allowances are given and the rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 1/50 in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases on a graduated scale to Shs. 11/- in the £ on incomes exceeding £50,000 per annum. In addition a surcharge of 75 cents is made on each £ of chargeable income in excess of £800. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/- in the £. The maximum rate of the personal tax is £10 per annum and the amount of the hospital contribution is calculated on the amount of total income.

The other main forms of taxation are Customs and excise duties.

Currency

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also British Somaliland and Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-), and Shs. 1/- (notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

A review of the relevance of the Ten-Year Plan 1946-55 programme in the light of changing circumstances was entrusted to a Sub-Committee of Executive Council, and in view of the effect of the prolongation of the Emergency on priorities this Committee decided to draw up a completely revised programme for a period of three and a half years ending 30th June, 1957. In the present disturbed situation and with the increase in the establishment of the police and prison services the Planning Sub-Committee have had to recommend large allocations for police, prison and military buildings; and in view of the sharp increase in the burden of Government expenditure and the possible effect of the Emergency on business confidence, the Committee have been anxious to ensure that all projects which are likely to raise productivity are provided with the necessary capital finance. A detailed analysis of the proposed expenditure programme amounting to £21 million will be presented in the Committee's report.

Total expenditure envisaged under the ten-year plan 1946-55 was £38·8 million and by the end of 1953 actual expenditure amounted to £27·4 million, or 70 per cent. of the plan value.

Ten-Year Development Plan

| Purpose                        | Allocations | Expenditure |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Security Buildings            | 6%          | 4%          |
| Public Administration         | 10%         | 12%         |
| Economic Development          | 51%         | 52%         |
| Social Development            | 25%         | 24%         |
| Unallocateable                | 8%          | 7%          |

Approximately 18 per cent. of this expenditure was financed by transfers from appropriated funds, 24 per cent. by contributions from Colony revenue and 45 per cent. by loan monies. In the present planning period much greater reliance will have to be placed on loan monies for all accumulated funds have now been exhausted and no transfers from Colony revenue will be possible.

Education (1953 figures)—African

The number of African Secondary and post-Secondary schools was 56, with an enrolment of 4,583 pupils. Twenty of these institutions were Government schools with 2,244 pupils, and 36 were aided schools with 2,339 pupils. There was a total of 3,319 Primary and Intermediate schools, with 330,190 pupils. Of these, 236 were Government schools with 27,270 pupils; 1,911 schools with 236,485 pupils were aided and 1,172 schools with 66,435 pupils were unaided. Among these schools were 53 teacher-training centres, six vocational schools and one teacher-training centre—having 62 pupils who have passed the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate.

Asian Education

The number of Secondary schools remained at 20 with a total enrolment of 4,401 pupils. There were ten Government schools with 3,389 pupils, four aided Secondary schools with 946 pupils and six unaided schools with 66 pupils. The number of Primary schools was 100 with a total enrolment of 26,566 pupils. There were 18 Government Primary schools with 13,624 pupils, 72 aided schools with 12,381 pupils and ten unaided schools with 561 pupils. In these Primary schools there were 14,507 boys and 12,059 girls. There were also three Government teacher-training colleges with a total of 125 students of whom 61 were girls.
European Education

There were nine Secondary schools of which four had classes for Primary school children. The total number of Secondary pupils was 2,009. There were three Government schools with 1,455 pupils, one school with 153 pupils was aided and the five other schools with 401 pupils were unaided. Schools providing Primary education numbered 39, with a total enrolment of 5,508 pupils. There were twelve Government schools with 3,494 pupils, ten aided schools with 509 pupils, and 17 unaided schools with 1,505 pupils.

Arab and Other Races' Education

There was one Government Secondary school with 82 pupils, and ten Government Primary schools with 1,763 pupils. There was a total enrolment of 1,781 pupils in two aided Secondary schools and three aided Primary schools.

Higher Education

The only institution for higher education in East Africa at present is Makerere College in Uganda. In 1954, 56 Kenya students were admitted to the College making a total of 168 students in all from Kenya in residence.

A second institution, the Royal Technical College, Nairobi, is under construction.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education, usually in institutions overseas. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds drawn from the Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly to men at Makerere College, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for Asian teachers to enable them to take degree courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts in Secondary schools. Among other sources of funds to assist students in going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Government of India, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards are made on the recommendation of a Committee for Study and Training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

The total number of Kenya students in the United Kingdom for the academic session 1953–54 was 482. This number included 55 Africans (33 with bursaries or scholarships), nine Arabs (eight with bursaries or scholarships), 257 Asians (44 with bursaries or scholarships), 161 Europeans (42 with bursaries or scholarships). There were also approximately 50 Kenya African students in India during this period.

Total Government recurrent expenditure on education in 1953 was £2,452,609, compared with £170,000 in 1935.

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library and the Desai Memorial Library, both in Nairobi, and also the Library in Mombasa. The Ministry of African Affairs has a small library of general reference books and books on Africa.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Curator, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, is assisted by a staff of eight Europeans and eighteen Africans.

Health

Total expenditure by the Medical Department on Hospital Health Services in 1953 was £1,243,804 compared with £203,451 in 1935.

In 1953 beds available in Hospitals (including Maternity Homes) totalled 8,661 (Government 6,469, Local Authorities 506, Missions 1,190, Private 496). In-patients in Government Hospitals totalled 162,635, out-patients 1,091,709.

Communications

Eastleigh airport, Nairobi, is the main aerodrome used by international services. Internal scheduled services operated by E.A.A.C. are based on Nairobi West and operate services in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of aircraft-operating companies are based at Nairobi West. Air Safety and Aeradio Services are provided by the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. All air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the Air Transport Authority.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Aden, Ethiopia and Madagascar.

There are approximately 20,500 miles of road, varying in standard from good bitumen surfaced highways to tracks in the more remote areas which can be used only with difficulty by motor vehicles. The main roads, except during exceptional rains, are for the most part all-weather. They include part of the Great North Road (Cape Town to Cairo) which passes through Kenya by way of Namanga on the Tanganyika border, Nairobi, (near Kisumu on the Uganda border); the Nakuru, Eldoret, Broderick Falls to Tororo in Uganda; the Mombasa–Nairobi road; the Mau Summit–Kisumu road and the Nairobi–Nyeri–Nanyuki road.

Broadcasting

A broadcast transmitting station is operated at Nairobi by Cable and Wireless Limited. Programme material for a European and an Asian Service is produced by Cable and Wireless in their own Studios. All broadcasting to Africans, in Swahili, Kikuyu, Luo, Luluhya, Kikamba and Nandi/Kipsigis, is produced in the studios of the African Broadcasting Service, which is part of the Department of Information, and fed by land line to Cable and Wireless Ltd., for transmission on medium and short wave transmitters owned by the Department of Information and operated on its behalf by Cable and Wireless Ltd. Local broadcasts in Swahili and Arabic are also originated in a Department of Information Studio in Mombasa and transmitted there by Cable and Wireless Ltd. At Nyeri the Department operates its own short wave transmitter and originates four hours of Kikuyu broadcasting daily in its Studios there. All transmitters have a power of 5 kW. The Department of Information has distributed several thousand radio sets to African
listeners; the vernacular programmes are relayed by mobile vans in market places, etc., and rediffusion schemes are in operation in Nairobi and Nakuru. There are at present 18,000 licensed receiving sets in use in Kenya.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. Many Africans in the Highlands also own forest plantations. The estimated numbers in employment in other occupations in 1953 are shown in the following table:

| Non-African | African |
|-------------|---------|
| Agriculture and Forestry | 1,617 | 211,988 |
| Mining and Quarrying | 180 | 4,712 |
| Building and Construction | 2,363 | 13,740 |
| Commerce | 11,762 | 18,703 |
| Transport and Communications | 1,996 | 7,956 |
| Manufactures | 7,222 | 37,257 |
| Other Services | 214 | 39,310 |
| Public Services (including Government and Railways) | 16,567 | 117,956 |

In December, 1953, 14 employees' and five employers' unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total membership was 32,995.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops and products are sisal, coffee, tea, wattle extract, cotton, maize, wheat and pyrethrum.

Beef production, dairying, sheep, pigs and poultry play an increasingly important rôle in the general agricultural policy of the Colony and considerable quantities of meat, butter, hides and skins, wool and bacon are produced annually. In addition there is considerable African production of millets, grains and pulses which often yield an exportable surplus.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony's timber supplies—softwoods such as *Podocarpus* and pencil cedar and hardwoods such as East African olive and camphor. Forest produce from the established plantations is becoming available in increasing quantities and already provides some 15% of the annual softwoods production of the Colony, as well as considerable numbers of poles. The annual yield of mangrove poles from the coastal areas is in the region of 750,000.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and in Lake Victoria and apart from seasonal shortages, an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The chief minerals in order of value covering the year 1953 were soda ash, salt, kyanite including mullite, gold, copper concentrates, lime products, diatomite, carbon dioxide gas and graphite. A certain amount of asbestos was also produced.

The total value of minerals won during 1953 was approximately £1,470,000.

There are some 80 main types of manufacturing and industrial activity, producing goods for local consumption and export. The main productions for export are aluminium holloware, bacon and pork products, base metals, boots and shoes, canned foodstuffs, cheese, cigarettes, diatomite products, dried milk, essential oil, gold, soda, hydrogenated oils, insecticides, kyanite and mullite, passion fruit juice and pulp, pyrites, pyrethrum extract, refractories, sisal products, tanned leather, wattle extract or bark, woollen blankets and textiles, pencil slats. Fancy leather goods and native curios are made by individual craftsmen for local consumption and export.
