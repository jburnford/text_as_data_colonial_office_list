CYPRUS

Area

The island of Cyprus is 3,572 square miles in area.

Population

The population in July, 1954 was 515,000. The distribution of population by religion in the 1946 census was as follows:

| Per cent. |
|-----------|
| Greek Orthodox | 80·3 |
| Turkish Moslem | 17·9 |
| Others | 1·8 |

Geographical Features

The three main zones are:
(a) the Kyrenia range, which rises to a height of over 3,000 feet, running along the northern coast and terminating in the Karpas peninsula;
(b) the massif in the south-west of the island, of which the highest point is Mount Olympus (6,406 feet); and
(c) the central plain, known as the "Mesaoria".

Climate

The mean temperature as recorded in Nicosia for the last 20 years is 66·6°F.; mean maximum 78·5°F.; mean minimum 54·7°F.; highest shade temperature during that time, 111°F.; lowest, 22°F.; average rainfall for the last 20 years, 20·81 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole island. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the coast; on the hills inland it is bracing and healthy. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point on the plains and is mild on the coast, whilst the inland mountains are snow-covered for several weeks.

History

The history of Cyprus is long and eventful. In early historical times the island had been under the rule of Persia, Egypt, Rome and Byzantium. During the last named period its Governor, Isaac Commenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. In 1191 Cyprus was conquered by Richard I of England following the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. From Richard the island passed to the Knights Templars, and later, when they found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, although the Genoese Republic held Famagusta from 1373 until 1464. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island and retained possession of it until its transfer to British administration.

On 4th June, 1878, a convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements" consented "to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England".

On 14th August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of 5th November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognized the annexation.

On 1st May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally made a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Constitution

Up to 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent of 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by Executive and Legislative Councils. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official members and 15 elected members, three chosen by the...
Mohammedan and 12 by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island, those clauses of the Letters Patent which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor. There is an Executive Council consisting, at present, of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, the Commissioner of Labour, and three non-official members.

**Land Policy**

Individual ownership of land is recognized and non-natives may acquire land. Except with the consent of the Governor, no alien may acquire, otherwise than by inheritance, ownership of any immovable property in the Colony. Compulsory acquisition of land may be made for purposes of public utility, with the consent of the Governor.

**Taxation**

Incomes which do not exceed £300 are exempted from income tax; and the tax ranges from 1s. for every £ in excess of £300 to 15s. for every £ in excess of £6,000. Relief is given at the rate of £50 for each unmarried child under the age of 16 or (if over 16) receiving full-time instruction at an educational establishment. Where any child between the ages of 11 and 25 is receiving full-time instruction outside the Colony, this allowance is increased by an amount not exceeding £200 in respect of expenditure incurred on the child's education. Relief is also given in respect of the wife's earned income up to a maximum of £50, and in respect of life insurance premiums and pension and provident fund contributions. In the case of bachelors and spinsters the tax payable is increased by 33½%, rising to 50% where the tax payable exceeds £90, up to a maximum of £500. The tax on salaries, wages and pensions is collected under the system of Pay As You Earn. Companies and similar bodies pay a flat rate of 8s. 6d. in the £ and deduct this tax from any dividends declared; credit is given to the shareholder for the tax thus deducted in calculating his personal tax liability. Arrangements for relief from double taxation exist with the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, and relief is also given if tax is payable on the same income in any of Her Majesty's possessions where reciprocal relief is given. By an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom and the Greek Government there is reciprocal exemption of air transport profits between Cyprus and Greece.

Estate duty is levied on the estate of any deceased person which exceeds £2,000 in value. The rates of estate duty are not fixed on a percentage basis in the case of estates of £15,000 in value and under. Such estates are divided into categories and the rates are specific amounts chargeable on each category. The specific amounts so chargeable range from £40 on estates between £2,000 and £2,500 in value to £1,615 on estates between £14,000 and £15,000 in value. In the case of estates in excess of £15,000 in value a percentage is imposed. This percentage ranges between 21% and 30% on that part of the estate which exceeds £15,000 in value. Relief is given in respect of quick succession where the estate consists of immovable property or a business, and for estate duty paid in respect of the same estate in any country of the British Commonwealth.

Other Development

The Electricity Authority of Cyprus has extended its area of supply to include the towns of Kyrenia and Paphos, the latter being supplied from a diesel generating station operated by the Authority in Paphos. Supply has also been given from the central system to the Improvement Areas of Platres and Troodos. Considerable development has taken place in each of the main towns, demand in some cases having been almost doubled since the introduction of the Authority’s new tariffs. Development of supply has also been encouraged in rural areas, particularly for irrigation purposes in the Astromeritis, Morphou and Peristeronari area.

In addition to the funds provided for the electrification scheme, Government has advanced and will continue advancing loans to public bodies, local government authorities, etc., to enable them to carry out their own development projects, e.g. workers’ housing schemes, water supplies, street improvement, erection of public buildings, etc. Up to the end of 1953, the outstanding balance of these loans amounted to £3,680,000.

Education

There is at present no form of higher education in Cyprus other than the two Teachers’ Training Colleges, one for men at Morphou and one for women at Nicosia. Secondary schools number 57 with an enrolment of 16,634, while elementary schools number 706 with an enrolment of 66,114. There are separate schools for Greeks, Turks, and Armenians, but most schools are co-educational. The school population is steadily increasing at present with a consequent rise in the number of teachers required and a need for more accommodation. Efforts are being made to develop technical education to a level more in keeping with the needs of the island.

Government expenditure on educational services in the school year 1952–53 amounted to £1,070,687 compared with £121,986 in 1935.

Libraries and Museums

In Nicosia, Kyrenia, Limassol and Paphos there are public libraries which are controlled by the Municipalities. The Antiquities Department maintain a Museum at Nicosia.

Health

Expenditure by Government on medical and allied services was £453,077 in 1953 compared with £52,436 in 1935. Ten Government hospitals (including two sanatoria, a mental hospital and a leper farm) provided 1,021 beds in 1953. In addition there were 523 beds in 39 private hospitals and 114 beds in 13 rural hospitals. Out-patients at Government institutions numbered 118,778; rural dispensaries dealt with 45,380.

Communications

Cyprus Airways Limited provide air services to Greece, Turkey, the Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and the Persian Gulf and in conjunction with B.E.A. to Rome and London. Other airlines serving the Colony are B.O.A.C., Greek National Airlines, El Al, Middle East Airlines, Air Liban, Turkish State Airlines and Skyways Ltd. There is one airfield at Nicosia and an emergency landing ground at Tymbou. There are no internal services.

The following table shows the roads, excluding Forest Department roads, which exist in the Colony:

| Commissioner's roads (mostly gravel) | 1,810 |
| P.W.D. roads (gravel) | 180 |
| P.W.D. roads (asphalt) | 739 |
| Total | 2,729 |

The most important ports are Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol. Famagusta has a harbour where vessels of an overall length of 425 feet can easily be berthed alongside the quay. Vessels at Larnaca and Limassol anchor in the open roadstead about 4–5 cables off the main jetty, and goods are transported to and from the shore by means of lighters.

Regular passenger services are run between Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean. Cargo ships of many nationalities—the most regular being vessels of the British Conference Lines (Mediterranean Section), some of which accept passengers—call at Cyprus ports, on itineraries between Continental and Mediterranean ports, Mediterranean and Red Sea ports and U.S.A., Mediterranean and Black Sea ports.

There is no railway or inland waterway.

Broadcasting

The Cyprus Broadcasting Service became fully operative on the 4th October, 1953. It is situated in Nicosia and operates on a medium-wave frequency of 692 Kc/s. with a power of 10 kW.
The three languages used are English, Greek and Turkish. The number of wireless licence holders in the Colony in 1954 was 45,000, most of them in urban areas.

**Principal Occupations**

The principal occupation is agriculture in which some 153,000 persons are employed. Estimated numbers in other occupations in 1950 were:—manufacturing industries 44,000 (building and contracting 8,800, clothing 7,000, textiles 5,700); service industries 51,400 (distributive trades 10,500, catering and hotels, 7,000); mines and quarries 6,300; Government service 6,000.

At the end of 1953 there were three Employers' Associations with 74 members, and 122 Workmen's Unions with a membership of 18,583. In addition there were two Federations co-ordinating the activities of Workmen's Unions and four Unions of Civil Servants.

**Main Crops and Products**

Wheat, barley, potatoes (two crops a year), grapes, raisins, cotton, deciduous fruit (apples, pears, cherries, plums, apricots, peaches), olives, almonds, carobs (locust beans), citrus, pulse crops, sesame, cumin, aniseed, onions, tobacco, wines, spirits, cheese and wool.

The livestock population is: sheep 351,000; goats 194,000; swine 35,000; cattle 30,000; donkeys 44,000; mules 7,000; horses 4,000.

Timber production in 1953 was 977,000 cubic feet R.U.B. including 827,000 cubic feet of softwood (pine) and 150,000 of hardwood timber. Firewood and charcoal production amounted to 432,000 and 23,000 cubic feet respectively. All these products were consumed in Cyprus. In addition 2,456,000 cubic feet of timber and 544,000 of derivative products were imported in 1953.

Cyprus fisheries are not rich owing to the lack of nutrient salts, and the supply of fish is not equal to the demand. All the catch is sold locally and consumed fresh. 280 sailing boats, 55 sailing auxiliaries, using nets or lines, and 9 trawlers (Cypriot) occupying altogether 940 persons, caught 340,050 okes* of fish, estimated at a value of £89,420, during the year 1953. Production of inshore fisheries is negligible.

The principal minerals are cupreous, iron pyrites and asbestos. Some 700,000 tons of pyrites, 100,000 tons of copper concentrates and 15,000 tons of asbestos are exported yearly. Chromite, gypsum and terra umbra are also produced and exported.

Cotton yarn spun locally satisfies a big proportion of the Colony's requirements; cotton goods and a variety of towels are manufactured locally by two main weaving plants and satisfy part of the local demand. There has recently been established in the island a modern ginnery and de-linting plant. Rayon goods are also manufactured on a limited scale. Other industries include the manufacture of cigarettes from imported and locally-grown yellow-leaf tobacco, wines and spirits, beer, cheese, macaroni, soap, soap oils, footwear, buttons, artificial teeth, carob gum, compound fodders, essential oils and perfumery, nails, lithographed crown corks, jute goods, plasters and plasterboards, pottery, bricks, tiles and mosaic. Plants for the refining of olive oil, the canning of jams, marmalades, fruit juices and vegetables also operate. An up-to-date factory for tyre retreading has been operating in the island since 1950. A great expansion has also been observed in the production of aerated drinks and of sugared almonds, Turkish delight and other confectionery.

Two important village industries are the manufacturing of "aladja"—a special kind of cotton cloth mainly worn by the rural population—and of high quality laces. Other village industries are twine, rope, basket and mat making.

**Tourist Traffic**

26,922 visitors came to Cyprus during 1953 compared with 27,353 in 1952. Members of H.M. Forces and their families stationed in the Middle East were encouraged to spend their leave in Cyprus and more than 19,000 came. The island's economy benefited by this invisible export to the extent of about £1,500,000 (not included in the above figures).

* 5 okes = 1 stone.
Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are at present no marketing boards in Cyprus. All zivania (grape alcohol used in the wines and spirits industry) must be delivered to the Vine Products Control Scheme against an initial purchase price for which an advance is provided by Government. All profits from the sales of zivania by the Vine Products Controller are returned to the producers in the form of dividends. The Controller (Commissioner for Co-operative Development) is advised by a Board on which producers and manufacturers are represented. A special reserve fund for stabilization or other purposes has been created. A similar scheme has been introduced recently for raisins. Government is also the sole purchaser of wheat and barley through the agency of co-operative societies.

The only other organized form of marketing is that of the various co-operative marketing societies and unions (and one federation of carob unions), which deal with substantial quantities of carobs, wines and spirits, and potatoes and lesser quantities of oranges, cherries and other fresh and dried fruits. There are at present 756 co-operative societies, the main types being credit, marketing, processing, consumers' stores and farming societies. Membership exceeds 120,000, reserves are more than £840,000 and deposits approximately £2,000,000.
