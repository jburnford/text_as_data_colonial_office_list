SINGAPORE

Area

The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islands, is 224·5 square miles. The City of Singapore covers an area of 31·5 square miles.

The area of Christmas Island is 62 square miles and of the Cocos-Keeling Islands, a group of 27 small coral islands, 5 square miles.

Legislation is being enacted to enable the Cocos-Keeling Islands to be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. The transfer will probably take place during 1955.
Population

The estimated population at 1st July, 1954, was:

|                | Singapore Island | Christmas Island |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Chinese        | 891,550          | 1,435            |
| Malaysians     | 142,843          | 396              |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 91,012       | 9                |
| Europeans      | 17,122           | 89               |
| Eurasians      | 11,402           |                  |
| Others         | 11,200           |                  |
| **Total**      | **1,165,129**    | **1,929**        |

The population of Singapore City, the seat of Government, is about 830,615.

The population of the Cocos-Keeling Islands, which numbered 1,000 in July 1952, has since been reduced by emigration to about 624.

Geographical Features

The highest point on Singapore Island is 581 feet above sea level. The largest permanent stream is the Sungei Seletar which is nine miles long. Forest and Nature Reserves, including mangrove swamps, total about 15 square miles.

The greater part of Christmas Island is a central plateau 600–700 feet above sea level, rising to low hills up to 1,170 feet. Most of the island is densely wooded; it contains extensive deposits of mixed phosphates. The island lies about 190 nautical miles south of the western extremity of Java.

The Cocos-Keeling Islands are a low-lying coral atoll, thickly covered with coconut palms; the highest point above sea level is 25 feet. The islands lie about 700 nautical miles south-west of Java.

Climate of Singapore

There are no well-defined dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The mean maximum temperature is 87°, the mean minimum 74°; average annual rainfall is 95 inches.

History

A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme, and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits; it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the Imperial Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was recovered on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, and was constituted a separate Colony.

Despite the despoliation it suffered during the occupation, and the post-war unrest which culminated in 1948 in the Malayan Emergency, Singapore entered a new phase of prosperity which was accentuated by the increased world demand for rubber. In 1951 imports were valued at $3,625,000,000 and exports at $4,095,000,000.

The Malayan Emergency has had its inevitable effect on Singapore, particularly in 1950 when there were many terrorist outrages. In December 1950 occurred the tragic riots arising from the "Bertha Hertogh" case, in which 18 people were killed. Public security was greatly improved during 1951, but must remain a constant concern of the Government so long as the Emergency lasts.
Constitution

The Constitution was brought into effect by the Singapore Colony Orders in Council 1946–50. These together with the Royal Instructions of 27th March, 1946, as amended from time to time, provided for:

(a) A Governor and Commander-in-Chief appointed by Commission under Her Majesty’s Sign Manual and Signet.

(b) An Executive Council, consisting of the Governor as Chairman; four ex officio members (namely, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, and the President, City Council); two nominated official members; four nominated unofficial members; two elected members elected by the nominated unofficials and elected members of the Legislative Council from among themselves.

(c) A Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President; four ex officio members (as for the Executive Council); five nominated official members; four nominated unofficial members; and not more than twelve elected members of whom three are severally elected by the European, Chinese and Indian Chambers of Commerce, and the remainder by popular franchise from nine single-member Electoral Districts.

The above mentioned Constitution was replaced by the coming into force on 8th February, 1955, of the Singapore Colony Order in Council, 1955, which established the new Constitution recommended by the Rendel Commission. The first elections under the new Constitution are due to be held on 2nd April, 1955. Presided over by a Speaker there will be an Assembly of 32 with 25 elected members, four nominated unofficials, and the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary as ex officio official members. Based on the majority party or group of parties, this Assembly will be a Council of Ministers of nine, six elected members and the three ex officio members. They will be a “Cabinet” with collective responsibility for the affairs of the Colony, except for foreign affairs, defence and internal security.

The present City Council and Rural Board will be replaced by a City and Island Council of a Mayor, eight aldermen and 24 elected Councillors.

Land Policy

From the foundation of the Settlement of Singapore there has never been any restriction on the alienation of land to non-natives. Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant Crown land within the City area is practically exhausted and large areas are in process of acquisition for public purposes, particularly housing.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the Colony or received in the Colony from outside. Companies are chargeable at 30% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 3% on the first $500 of chargeable income and rising to 30% on incomes exceeding $50,000. Non-resident individuals are charged from 20% to 30%, but British subjects and British protected persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. A double taxation arrangement with the United Kingdom is in force.

Public Finance

| Year       | Revenue ($ million) | Expenditure ($ million) |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1946 (9 months) | 29,498,716          | 24,352,910              |
| 1947        | 77,967,858          | 51,824,007              |

| 1950        | 114,016,040         | 97,117,474              |
| 1951        | 175,295,833         | 127,397,183             |
| 1952        | 210,561,686         | 167,754,073             |
| 1953        | 238,518,829         | 169,730,549             |

In 1953 29.78% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 52.33% from income and other taxes.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Administration—general 10.66%
- Social Services 23.52%
- Judicial, Police and Prisons 14.20%
- Miscellaneous Services 14.71%

The Public Debt of the Colony of Singapore at the 31st December 1953 amounted to $115 million or approximately $102.38 per head of the population. The Public Debt comprises:

- S.S. 3% Loan, 1962–72: $30 million
- S.S. 3% War Loan, 1952–59: $25 million
- S.S. 3% War Loan, 1953–60: $10 million
- Singapore 3% Rehabilitation Loan, 1962–70: $50 million

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is the only legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
   - The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners;
   - The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya;
   - The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of 5 cent denomination.

(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. Currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July 1941 were demonetized on 31st August, 1948.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December, 1952, and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation as at 31st December, 1953, was $22,090,075.45.

The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1953, was $740,923,669 and coins (other than silver) $23,037,410.33.

Development Plans

Thirty-two separate projects of the Singapore Development Plan are being actively pursued at present. The eventual expenditure on these projects is expected to be approximately $100,000,000.
over a ten-year period ending in 1960. The group nature of these projects is set out in the table below.

|                | £000 | $000 | Per cent. |
|----------------|------|------|-----------|
| Agriculture    | 450  | 3,857| 1         |
| Transport/     |      |      |           |
| Communications | 10,103| 86,597| 10        |
| Fuel/Power     | 16,517| 141,574| 16½       |
| Multi-Purpose  | 5,600 | 48,000| 5¼        |
| Social Capital | 67,000| 574,286| 67        |
| Research       | 330  | 2,829| ½         |
| **Total**      | 100,000| 857,143| 100%      |

Out of this total about £33,000,000 is estimated to have been spent by the end of 1954 leaving £67,000,000 to be spent from 1955 to 1960 inclusive.

The Housing programme of the Singapore Improvement Trust is estimated to cost about £25,000,000. Both Government and the City Council are also engaged in extensive schemes for housing their own employees.

The ten-year programme includes about £12,000,000 for expenditure on Schools and Medical buildings.

The improvement of the Water Supply and Sewerage of Singapore City and Island involve a final expenditure of more than £8,000,000 on water supply and about £5,000,000 on sewerage.

Under the head Transport/Communications the new airport at Paya Lebar is expected to require approaching £4,500,000 before completion and the Singapore Harbour Board's new graving dock and wharf extension between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000.

Under Fuel and Power, the new Pasir Panjang Power Station will eventually cost between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000. A further £5,000,000 represents the cost of the new distribution system.

Of the amount earmarked for multi-purpose schemes, much the largest part is for two extensive development-cum-reclamation schemes.

The Colonial Development and Welfare Fund has provided $10,000,000 towards the cost of the new International Airport and has made a loan of $1,750,000 towards the new graving dock. The total grant for all services, including a Regional Fisheries Research Laboratory, is $16,168,000 to be spent up to the end of March, 1956. All the rest of the schemes in the Development Plan are to be financed by local resources. Hitherto the expenditure on Government projects has been met from revenue, or from accumulated surpluses, which have also provided money to be lent to the Improvement Trust for its housing programme. The projects of the City Council which include the Pasir Panjang Power House and distribution system, the extension of the water supply, and of water-borne sewerage, are largely financed by loans raised in Singapore by the issue of Municipal Debenture Stocks. During 1954 a sum of $30,000,000 was raised in this way. The City Council has hitherto been able to finance part of its programme from revenue surpluses.

A recent estimate suggests that the Colony will still have to find, from revenue surpluses and previous savings, whether of the Government, the City Council or the Harbour Board, and also from current surpluses of the Singapore Improvement Trust, etc., a sum of just over £30,000,000, during the next five or six years.

Other Development

Twenty-four acres of the 53-acre industrial estate of the Colonial Development Corporation had been developed by the end of 1954. The estate is sub-divided into factory sites each of an area of approximately two acres and each having light, power and water available. Manila rope, edible oils, yarn and boot polish are being produced.

The Corporation has been joined by the Government of the Federation of Malaya in making share and loan capital available for the Federal and Colonial Building Society, Limited, which was set up to assist in alleviating the housing shortage and continues to expand both in Singapore and the Federation. The authorized capital is $50 million (£5,833,333) of which the paid-up capital is approximately £1,073,000. Approximately 2,318 loans have been negotiated between March 1950 and September 1954, and the total amount advanced has been approximately £3,256,000. The Society aims at bringing home ownership within the ability of lower income groups.

Education

The 549 schools in the Colony provide education for some 180,000 students of whom 83,000 are taught in English and the remainder in the main vernacular languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). There are 6,182 teachers employed, about 43% of them being trained. Approximately 12% of the students are in Secondary Classes. The Technical Schools provide for 360 students following day courses, and about 1,500 enrolments in 50 evening classes. Nearly 900 students are under training in the Teachers' Training College, the majority on part-time courses while working as student probationer teachers in the schools. The University of Malaya has 282 men and 90 women students from Singapore; 95 Singapore students are studying at Universities and Colleges overseas. Adult Education Classes are now attended by 9,910 persons. The Singapore Education Committee advises Government on all aspects of education, and the Education Finance Board scrutinizes and approves the Departmental estimates before their submission to Government. The net cost of Education in 1953 was $19·24 million (capital expenditure $1·53 million), compared with $3·38 million (capital expenditure $0·22 million) in 1947. The large increase is due to the implementation of the Ten-Year and Supplementary Plans for educational expansion.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Raffles Library (at present attached for administrative purposes to Raffles Museum) contains about 70,000 volumes. In 1954 it had over 10,000 subscribers. The Museum has departments of zoology, ethnography and archaeology of the Malaysian region, and of the history of Singapore and Malaya. It publishes the Bulletin of the Raffles Museum.

The Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, closely associated with the Raffles Museum, publishes a quarterly journal devoted mainly to history, archaeology and ethnography.

Health

The Government Medical Department provides some 5,000 beds in its eight hospitals and Leper Settlement of which some 1,400 are available for the treatment of acute disease. There are eight static dispensaries, four travelling dispensaries and a floating dispensary service for general cases.
among the population of over 300,000 in the rural areas, and a chain of 43 centres where the Government maternity and child welfare division operates in addition. A school medical and dental service and a quarantine service are working on a steadily expanding basis.

A ten-year Medical Plan is in operation to double all the existing services and provide adequate service for the whole population by 1960, and a well-appointed Nurses' Home, for 250 nurses, a new outpatients' division, with a modern blood-transfusion unit at the Civil General Hospital of 800 beds, and two large rural health centres were completed and opened in 1953. Work has already begun on improvements and extensions to the Maternity Hospital covering both accommodation and teaching facilities and for the provision of three more rural Maternity and Child Welfare centres. Under the Plan the Tuberculosis Hospital will be built up to 1,100 beds from the present 400 beds. New wards are being built at the Children's Orthopaedic Hospital and at the centre for leprosy cases. The Venereal Diseases campaign is conducted on most up-to-date lines with a special hospital, clinics, a travelling dispensary and a follow-up visiting scheme.

In the field of tuberculosis, out-door treatment is provided at a clinic and domiciliary relief and assistance by the Almoners' Department is rapidly expanding; a B.C.G. campaign was successfully started in 1951. If the average incidence of tuberculosis from 1939-41 is taken as 100, the index, which rose to 170 during the Japanese occupation, has shown a steady decline over the post-war period to 32 in 1953. Some 17,000 cases of tuberculosis have passed through this centre since 1946 and the number of out-patients in regular attendance is over 6,000. This problem remains one of the most urgent, however, and plans for more beds and a Chest Unit are in hand. The Royal Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association with its own clinic and treatment centre gives most valuable co-operation to the Government. This Association is also greatly extending the scope of its service, particularly in rehabilitation. The Tuberculosis Treatment Allowance Scheme is operated by the Department of Social Welfare. The payment under this scheme is restricted to patients whose prognosis is good and who are likely to be returned to their former working capacity within a reasonable space of time.

Main hospital out-patient attendances, which were under 100,000 per annum before the war, have risen to over 950,000; yearly attendances at rural and maternity clinics have risen from 85,000 to 227,037. Homes visited by nurses now total 53,302 and by midwives 46,388. An attempt is made to see all rural births, while the Maternity Hospital deals with some 20,400 maternity cases yearly or over 37% of the total births of the Colony. In-patients in the main acute hospitals total over 55,000 per annum, compared with 26,000 before the war. Leprosy services are being rapidly modernized and some 1,500 patients are under treatment or observation.

There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualifications of M.B. and B.S., registrable in the United Kingdom, can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery: also registrable in the United Kingdom), the Diploma of Pharmacy and the Diploma of the Royal Sanitary Institute. A complete course for nurses is in operation and the local qualification is now registrable in England and Wales. The Diploma in Public Health granted by the University is recognized by the General Medical Council.

Statutory Boards cover all medical, nursing, dental and pharmacy activities, and there is a Hospitals Board.

Health figures for the Colony continue to improve. Although the population is increasing by some 35,000 a year through natural means the death rate decreased from 19·51 in 1939 to 10·31 in 1953. The infantile death rate fell from 130·4 per thousand in 1939 to 67·04 in 1953. With no outbreak of any of the major infectious diseases, Singapore remains one of the healthiest city ports in the Far East. The birth rate at 48·68 continues to be one of the highest in the world. This has resulted in a very young population with its special and peculiar problems.

All the usual special Departments such as eye, ear, nose and throat and orthopaedics, are included in the hospital services. Physiotherapists, almoners, health visitors and occupational therapists are employed on an expanding scale. Treatment of mental disease is based on one of the largest institutions in the East and here all the modern forms of treatment can be obtained.

The Government expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1953 amounted to $20·7 million compared with $6·3 million in 1947 and $12·75 million in 1951.

Communications

Kallang Airport, on the southern side of Singapore Island, which has been an international civil airport since 1937, will close in 1955 when the new international airport at Paya Lebar is opened. The new airport has a runway 8,000 feet in length and will be equipped to meet the highest International Civil Aviation Organisation standards. The Air Traffic Control Centre now based at Kallang will also be removed to the new aerodrome and will control the traffic in the Singapore Flight Information Region on an advisory route system. The terminal building is not expected to be ready until some time in 1957.

Major external international passenger, airmail and cargo services operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways London–Singapore–Sydney
- British Overseas Airways Corporation London–Sydney
- London–Hong Kong
- London–Singapore
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines Amsterdam–Djakarta
- Pan American Airways Incorporated Singapore–Manila–San Francisco
- Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. Hong Kong–Bangkok–Singapore
- Hong Kong–Saigon–Singapore
- Garuda Indonesian Airways Djakarta–Borneo
- Djakarta–Bangkok
- Medan–Singapore
- Djakarta–Palembang
- Djakarta–Medan
- Air India International Bombay–Madras–Singapore
- Union of Burma Airways Rangoon–Singapore

The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge. The Railway enters the Colony at the
Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour. There are four railway stations in the Island of Singapore.

223·5 miles of bituminous and 8·93 miles of gravelled surface roads are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The control of the port of Singapore is divided between (a) a government and (b) a non-government authority.

(a) The Master Attendant administers all the waters of the port including the Outer and Inner Roads, Keppel Harbour, the Western Anchorages, Telok Ayer Basin, the Singapore, Rochore, Kallang and Geylang rivers and other Colony waters.

(b) The Singapore Harbour Board administers the wharves, docks and premises of the Board situated in Keppel Harbour and a slipway at Tanjong Rhu under the provisions of the Ports Ordinance; also the quays and waterfront premises at Telok Ayer Basin on behalf of the Singapore Government. With the exception of the Chairman (Manager) the members of the Board are appointed by the Governor.

The natural harbours around the southern end of the island still retain their deep water channel capable of taking the largest ships. Wharves comprise:

| Length | Water depth |
|--------|-------------|
| West Wharf | 4,525 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| Empire Dock (24½ acres) | 3,522 ft. 27 ft. and over |
| Main Wharf | 3,152 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| East Wharf | 700 ft. 24 ft. |
| Sheers Wharf | 325 ft. 24 ft. |

In 1953 cargo handled by the wharves totalled 5,357,049 tons. In the first half of 1954, 2,230,800 tons were handled. A total of 3,698 ships was worked, the aggregate net registered tonnage being 10,398,970 tons.

The Board maintains tugs for the towing, berthing and unberthing of ships; lighters, a fleet of steel barges and a salvage tug with a range of 5,000 miles.

The Board has first-class facilities for docking and ships' repairs with five dry docks operating. The largest of these is King's Dock, which can accommodate ships up to 45,000 tons, and construction has begun on a parallel Queen's Dock. There are also modern plating shops to carry out hull repairs. Electric current for lighting and power can be supplied to vessels alongside repair berths and in dry docks. Fresh water, steam, hydraulic power and compressed air are all available throughout the dockyards. A modern oxygen plant is also available for ship repair work.

The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, the U.S.A., and other countries in the Far East, and there is a regular freight and passenger service to South Africa via East African ports, and to South America. Several coasting lines are engaged in trade to Indonesia and in conveying transit cargo to Thailand, Borneo and Sarawak.

Broadcasting

Radio Malaya is operated on a pan-Malayan basis by the Department of Broadcasting for the Governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. Programmes in English, Chinese (seven dialects), Malay and Tamil are broadcast over three networks. The total number of hours of broadcasting is 240 per week, of which over 24 hours are occupied by broadcasts to Schools in English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil.

In Singapore the Department has studios and offices at Caldecott Hill. The main transmitting Station is at Jurong, some 14½ miles from the City, where four short wave transmitters of average power 5 kW, and three medium wave transmitters of average power 10 kW, are situated.

In the Federation of Malaya studios and offices are maintained at Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca. V.H.F. equipment has now been installed and these stations are fully integrated with the Singapore programmes.

The number of current broadcast listening station licences is 42,470 in Singapore and 110,835 in the Federation of Malaya.

A commercial company operates a rediffusion service in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Penang under Government licence, to which there are at present 30,232 subscribers in Singapore, 10,887 in Kuala Lumpur and 4,617 in Penang.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief occupations are: transport and communications (including port and lightercage) 55,000, commerce and finance 100,000, light industries 82,000, agriculture (largely market gardening) 30,000, public administration (central Government, Defence Services and Local Authorities) 60,000. There are 183 registered trade unions, having a membership of 79,764.

Main Products

The small area of agricultural land is used mainly to produce food crops for local consumption. There is also a considerable production of pigs (some 219,000) and poultry (about 3½ million head) but other livestock are relatively few.

Manufactures comprise a wide range of light industries, employing directly some 60,000 workers. In the main, production consists in the processing of primary products such as rubber, tin, copra, sago, rattan, etc.; ship-building, docking and ship repairing facilities; and the production of a growing range of consumer goods such as dry cell batteries, glass products, aerated water, edible oils, matches, plastics, sauces, aluminium ware, textiles, boot polish and rope.

There is extensive fishing in local waters, but the catch is insufficient to meet the demand and is supplemented by imports. In consequence, Government is giving every encouragement to the development of offshore fisheries.

Trade

Singapore handles the major proportion of the imports and exports of the Federation of Malaya. In addition much of the external trade of her more immediate neighbours passes through her hands. The chief exports are rubber, tin, petroleum products, copra, canned pineapples, coconut oil and spices. A wide range of manufactured consumer and capital goods is also imported for local consumption and for re-export.

(See Federation of Malaya for statistics of pan-Malayan trade.)

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and
with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. The Pineapple Joint Industrial Council is concerned with the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruits, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.

Fifty co-operative societies were registered as at the 31st December, 1953. They had a membership of 22,167, a working capital of $6,133,698 and reserve funds of $208,769. They include 40 Thrift and Loan, and Thrift, Societies and a Housing Society.
