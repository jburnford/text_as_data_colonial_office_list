NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland)

Area

The area is 49,177 square miles of which 12,298 square miles is water (Lake Nyasa).

Population

The estimated population at the 30th June, 1953, was 2,432,600:

- Europeans: 5,000
- Asiatics: 7,600
- Africans: 2,420,000

The main tribal groups of the Africans are:

| Tribe          | Per cent. |
|----------------|-----------|
| Chewa (Chipeta)| 28        |
| Nguru          | 19        |
| Nyanja         | 15        |
| Yao            | 14        |
| Ngoni          | 9         |
| Tumbuka        | 6         |
| Chikunda       | 3         |
| Nkhonde        | 3         |
| Tonga          | 2         |
| Others         | 1         |

Geographical Features

Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa, and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.
(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000-3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland, and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chilwa and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate

The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History

The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters, and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to "The Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa"; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September, 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of "The Nyasaland Protectorate." The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

There have been two internal disturbances; the Chilembre Rising, in 1915, when an African pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges; and in 1953 disturbances in the Southern Province, attributed in large part to discontent over the African tenant system obtaining in privately-held estate land, resulted in the deaths of 12 Africans. In both cases rapid and successful counter-measures were taken.

Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 158). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council presided over by the Governor and comprising three ex officio members, one official member and two unofficial members, a total of six; and there is a Legislative Council comprising 20 members, of whom three are ex officio members, seven are official members and ten are unofficial members. Five of the unofficial members of Legislative Council are selected from nominations by public bodies representing European interests; one is nominated by the Governor; three African members are selected from nominations made by the African Protectorate Council, and one Asian member from nominations made by an Asian public body. There is an African Protectorate Council which advises Government in regard to matters concerning Africans and in each Province there is also an African Provincial Council.

Land Policy is controlled so far as African trust land, which comprises 87% of the total area of the Protectorate, is concerned, by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Order in Council, 1950; the Order in Council empowers the Governor at his discretion to lease trust land for terms up to 99 years, while the Secretary of State's sanction is required for the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is either held in private ownership or is public land, which includes areas of state forest; the disposal of public land is controlled by the Public Land Ordinance, 1951, which empowers the Governor to make grants, leases or other dispositions subject to the provisions of any Order in Council or any general or special instruction of the Secretary of State.

Taxation

Three forms of direct taxation are in force:—non-native poll tax and native tax under Territorial laws and taxes on incomes and profits under
the taxation laws of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In addition a "territorial surcharge" is levied on behalf of the Protectorate by the Federal Government under the authority of Nyasaland law on the income tax payable under Federal law. A non-native poll tax is payable by all non-native males over 18 years of age who are resident in the Protectorate. The rate of tax is £4 per year or £2 per half year. A native tax varying in amount from year to year is payable by all male Africans over 18 years of age. An automatic increase of a percentage of this tax is levied if the tax has not been paid by the 1st October in any year. The rate in 1954 was 17s. 6d. and the additional penalty 7s. 6d.

### Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938    | 842,410     | 810,260         |
| 1949    | 2,587,664   | 2,745,295       |
| 1950    | 3,545,763   | 3,598,195       |
| 1951    | 3,865,601   | 4,030,910       |
| 1952    | 3,949,208   | 3,904,596       |
| 1953    | 4,894,613   | 4,424,804       |
| 1953–54 (18 months period — estimate) | 7,533,993 | 7,751,937 |

The Public Debt at the end of December 1953 amounted to £5,639,587 composed of the following:

- Loan from H.M.G. (1945) ... 719,587
- Nyasaland 3% Guaranteed Loan 1954–75 ... 1,570,000
- Development Loan 4½% 1971–78 ... 2,060,000
- Loan from H.M.G. 1952 ... 1,290,000

### Currency

Under the Federation Coinage and Currency Act, 1954, the Federal Legislature has made provision for coinage and currency in the Federation. The issue of coinage and currency then came under the control of the Central African Currency Board. With effect from 1st January, 1955, British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Southern Rhodesian coins became the only legal tender in the Federal area.

### Development Plans

The Nyasaland Development Programme, as revised in 1950, provided for expenditure of £12½ million over the period 1946–56, and by the end of 1950 works to the value of approximately £3 million had been carried out. From 1951 onwards, large increases in the costs of material equipment and plant, coupled with a contraction in ordinary revenue, combined to slow down the rate of planned development.

On the introduction of the Federal Constitution, it was necessary to distinguish in the Nyasaland Development Plan the responsibilities of the Federal and of the Territorial Governments. This was done in the 1953 review of the Plan. It is now estimated to cost £33,000,000 to the end of the period in 1956. The division between Federal and Territorial Governments at 31st December 1953 was:

- Federal Government ... 22,500,000
- Territorial Government ... 10,500,000

Various research schemes are being financed from the Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, the most notable being a scheme for agricultural experimentation conducted near Lilongwe and a scheme for the geological mapping of the territory. Grants from the same source provide for the Domasi Community Development Scheme, for afforestation at the Mudi Dam and for the establishment of a properly equipped forestry depot at Blantyre, as well as for other forestry development schemes and for a rice project in the south Chilwa plain.

### Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation is developing an undertaking on the Vipya Plateau in the Northern Province for the production of tung oil. Prospecting for minerals is proceeding and considerable interest was shown during the year in the monazite and pyrochlore deposits known for some time to exist in the Protectorate. The development of Nyasaland is, however, at present concentrated mainly on the expansion of the production of crops. Considerable attention is also being given to forestry development by establishing new plantations and re-afforesting cleared areas and by improved timber utilization and extraction facilities. Good progress is also being made towards the provision of minimum public utilities and substantial programmes for the development of electrical services and urban water supplies.

### Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July, 1954.

In 1953 there were 3,641 African, ten Asian, one Eurafican and five European Primary Schools in the Protectorate, accommodating totals of 219,168 African, 791 Asian, 124 Eurafican and 466 European pupils. There is a Government African Secondary School at Dedza, where technical and commercial, as well as academic wings, are being developed. Including enrolment at other Secondary Schools, 402 Africans were pursuing a course of secondary education. European children generally go to Southern Rhodesia for post-primary education.

There are 10 assisted Teacher Training Centres, in addition to the Government Teacher Training Centre at Domasi. They catered for 554 African teacher trainees during the year. During 1953 there were 21 holders of Government University Scholarships. Seven of these were held by Africans, eleven by Europeans and three by Asians. In addition, seven scholarships financed by a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds were held during 1953, three by Africans and four by Europeans.

Expenditure on education for the year 1953 was some £460,000, including estimated expenditure by local authorities and voluntary agencies. In 1934 expenditure was some £67,000.

### Libraries

Public libraries exist at Blantyre for both Africans and Europeans, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at the three secondary schools, and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of
subjects and makes these available to study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health

Public Health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July, 1954.

The principal endemic diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread. Epidemics of smallpox rarely now occur. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, reappeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952, but has again subsided.

There are 19 Government African hospitals and one mental hospital for Africans in the Protectorate with accommodation for 1,245 and 150 respectively. Each hospital has a number of satellite rural dispensaries of which there are 93 in the Protectorate. There are also four Health Units. There are three Government European hospitals with a total of 39 beds. Accommodation for Asians is provided at various of the Government hospitals. Mission hospitals provide 790 beds inclusive of maternity beds.

Estimated Government expenditure on health in 1953 was £248,459. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £40,808.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial roads and other aspects of communications.

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and ten out-station airfields to which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Federal Director of Meteorological Services, and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre and Lilongwe. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation, and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways operate a twice-weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 289 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Province. At Chipoka south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. In 1953, 326,324 tons of freight and 355,969 passengers were carried.

The total road mileage is 4,852, of which less than 100 miles have a bituminous carpet.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing eight vessels. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

Monkey Bay–Chipoka–Kota Kota–Likoma Island – Chinteche – Nkata Bay – Mamba Bay (Tanganyika) – Ruarwe – Florence Bay – Deep Bay – Ngara – Kaporo (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

Broadcasting

A small pilot broadcasting service was started in September 1953, but technical and other difficulties led to the station being closed down in December. Recording in the Zomba studio continues and arrangements have been made for the transmission of a daily half-hour programme from Lusaka. There are about 3,000 receiving sets in the Protectorate with an estimated average of eight listeners per receiver.

The Principal Occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, tung farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and cotton cultivation, retail trading.

There are six Trades Unions in the Protectorate with a membership of approximately 1,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize, millet, cassava, groundnuts, tea, tobacco, rice, cotton, tung-oil, soya beans.

Timber production in 1953 was: softwoods 211,600 cubic feet, hardwoods 288,800 cubic feet, poles 199,206 cubic feet, firewood 1,552,200 cubic feet.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa but very little organized trade: fishery research is being undertaken.

The only mineral exported in any quantity during 1953 was kyanite.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of plywood, soap, cigarettes, and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of exports and imports.

| Year | Imports* | Re-exports | Domestic Exports |
|------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 833,324  | 14,919     | 959,810         |
| 1949 | 5,592,100| 40,731     | 4,689,733       |
| 1950 | 7,543,323| 72,122     | 4,979,939       |
| 1951 | 7,293,756| 129,633    | 5,769,030       |
| 1952 | 8,744,626| 100,521    | 6,197,974       |
| 1953 | 7,579,735| 160,752    | 7,118,013       |

* Including Government imports but not bullion and specie.

In 1938, 45·7% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 5·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 48·4% from foreign countries. In 1953 the corresponding figures were 51·43%, 32·43% and 16·14%.

In 1938, 90·6% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 3·4% to other Commonwealth countries and 6% to foreign countries. In 1953 the corresponding figures were 63·9%, 20·2% and 15·9%.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

The marketing of the two principal African trust land crops, tobacco and cotton, is handled by two statutory boards, whose aim is to ensure a steady remunerative price to the producer, to secure improvement of the quality of the product and to build up reserves. The boards help to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of an annual contribution from profits to the Native Development and Welfare Fund. The marketing and distribution of maize, beans and groundnuts is the concern of the Produce Marketing Board which aims at an equitable distribution to industry and others of supplies of produce surplus to the subsistence requirements of the producer. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom and other extraterritorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1953 there were 71 co-operative societies, with 4,200 members and total working capital of £13,484 of which some £4,700 consists of loans provided by the Commissioner for Co-operative Development from the Native Development and Welfare Fund of the Protectorate.
