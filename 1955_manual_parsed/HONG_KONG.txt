Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° F. in February to 82° F. in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84·76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.

Principal Towns

The great bulk of the population lives in Victoria and Kowloon, which are each estimated to contain close to one million people. There are several flourishing market towns in the mainland part of the New Territories, which is predominantly agricultural, but the population has increased in some areas as a result of industrial development in post-war years. The most thickly populated of the outlying islands is Cheung Chau, with about 22,000 inhabitants. The fishing communities on the coast live to a great extent permanently afloat.

History

Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters' Island in the harbour, Aplichau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

Constitution

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of nine officials and eight unofficials, four of whom are Chinese and one Portuguese. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of five officials and ten unofficials, four of whom are elected.

Taxation

(1) Earnings and Profits Tax.—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:

(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).
(b) Salaries and Annuities Tax.
(c) Interest Tax.
(d) Property Tax.

The standard rate for 1954–55 is 12½% and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption...
limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries and Annuities Tax is levied on income from employment earned by residents of the Colony after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($5,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $3,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $45,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries and Annuities Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged at one-half of the standard rate (i.e. 6½%) on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony.

Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax as is the case under Salaries and Annuities Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.

(2) Estate Duty.—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 2% in the case of estates valued between $5,000 and $10,000, and 52% in the case of estates valued at over $30 million.

(3) Other Sources of Revenue.—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainment, Betting and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor, toilet preparations and table waters.

### Public Finance

| Year     | Revenue HK $ | Expenditure HK $ |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| 1939     | 41,478,053   | 37,949,116       |
| 1949–50  | 264,250,543  | 182,121,726      |
| 1950–51  | 291,728,416  | 251,684,524      |
| 1951–52  | 308,564,247  | 275,885,951      |
| 1952–53  | 484,390,446  | 411,749,658      |
| 1953–54  | 396,881,966  | 355,407,770      |
| 1954–55  | (estimated) 389,480,000 | 388,262,050 |

It is estimated that in 1954–55 $156,800,000 will be raised from direct and indirect taxes, $69,900,000 from Duties and $39,080,000 from Rates. For the same year the main heads of estimated expenditure are:

- Public Works: $110,306,487
- Police: $39,414,983
- Subventions: $36,960,325
- Medical: $27,843,553

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March, 1954, amounted to $56,136,000 (approximately $24.95 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:

- 3½% Dollar Loan (1934)—$3,160,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3½% Dollar Loan (1940)—$5,658,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3½% Rehabilitation Loan (1947–48)—$46,666,000 (Sinking Fund of $13,242,194).

Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes—$652,000.

### Currency

The value of the HK$, at approximately HK $1—1s. 3d., is kept stable in relation to the £ sterling by an Exchange Equalization Fund.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and to a small extent by two other Banks, and of $1 notes and nickel alloy 50 cent, 10 cent and 5 cent coins.

### Development Plans

Over the next five years it is proposed to expend the sum of $461 million on major development projects, $372 million of which will be provided from general revenue and $89 million from the Colony’s Development Fund.

The main items to be financed from the Development Fund are:

- Housing: $75 million
- Sports Stadium: $4 million
- Land Reclamation: $10 million

The main items to be financed from current revenue are as follows:

- New Schools: $5 million
- New Hospitals and Clinics: $37 million
- Government Offices: $21 million
- Government Quarters: $19 million
- City Hall: $16 million
- Reclamation Schemes: $2 million
- Piers: $18 million
- Waterworks: $122 million
- Roads: $16 million
- Abattoir: $15 million
- Drainage: $5 million
- Kai Tak Airport: $96 million

### Education

In 1954 education was provided in 1,097 schools for over 224,000 pupils. This figure represents rather less than one in ten of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:

- Primary: 169,000
- Secondary: 46,000
- Post-secondary: 8,000

Private schools provided places for some 144,000 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 62,000; while 40 Government institutions catered for 17,000 children. There were 280 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies in 1953–54, including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $23 million as compared with $24 million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.

The University of Hong Kong has 938 students in the following faculties—arts, science, medicine, engineering and architecture. The annual Government grant to the University has been increased to $4 million and in addition, an annual capital grant of up to $3 million is to be made available by Government.

### Libraries

Local libraries include an English and Chinese library at the University, a British Council library and a small educational library at the Education Department.
Health

The Health division undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and the inspection and treatment of school children. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda, the registration of births and deaths and pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work.

The Government maintains and operates eleven general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to six other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony nine private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups are 1,855, 1,663 and 990 respectively.

In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1953 totalled over 98,000, and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were just over 878,000. There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.

The general state of health is very good; there were no major epidemics except one of typhoid with 1,434 cases.

The most serious scourge is tuberculosis; 11,900 cases were notified in 1953 with 24.7% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned nearly 3,700 deaths; infant mortality was 73.6 per 1,000 live births.

Government expenditure on these services during the year 1953–54 amounted to approximately $29½ million, compared with $2 million in 1937.

Communications

Air.—The airfield at Kai Tak is limited in size by the geographical features of the neighbourhood, but international traffic continued steadily. During 1953 there were 12 companies operating regular international flights through the Colony, and the bulk of aircraft continued to be of the DC-3, DC-4, DC-6, Canadair, Constellation and Convair types. A total of 5,145 international flights of commercial aircraft carrying 96,421 passengers, 2,291,765 kilos of freight and 551,193 kilos of mail, in addition to transit traffic, was recorded during the year.

Rail.—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1953 amounted to 233,536 tons, and 3,993,002 passengers were carried.

Roads.—There are 437 miles of roadway, 94% of which is of metalled construction.

Shipping.—73,602 vessels entered and cleared during 1953–54, their net registered tonnage being 25,846,010. 1,728,371 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. A frequent ferry service crosses the harbour and links the principal islands to the westward.

Broadcasting

Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW.) from two separate stations, in English and three Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 2½ kW. There were 42,298 licence holders at the end of 1953. A private concern operates a rediffusion service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1953 there were some 44,865 subscribers to the service.

Principal Occupations

Most of the urban population is engaged in commerce or industry, and the rural population in agriculture or fishing. There has, however, been more industrial development in both the urban and rural districts and workers in registered and recorded factories and workshops numbered 103,596 at the end of 1953 of whom 37,606 were women. Employment is liable to fluctuation during any year but reliable statistics of unemployment and under-employment are not obtainable, nor is it possible to collect statistics of outworkers in the numerous cottage type industries. It is estimated, however, that another 100,000 persons are thus employed.

Figures for the main occupations are:

| Occupation                        | Number |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture                       | 200,000|

On 31st March, 1954 there were 226 registered workers' unions with a declared membership of 173,219; seventy-three employers' associations with a declared membership of 10,178 and four mixed unions with a declared membership of 4,277; the total declared membership being 187,674.

Main Crops and Products

The total area now under cultivation is estimated at 32,768 acres, including 24,576 under paddy, 2,097 under vegetables, and 1,114 under orchard. Some 24,046 metric tons of milled rice are estimated to be grown annually.

The estimated number of cattle is 11,275 head and of pigs 36,000 head.

About 32,952 tons of fish were marketed in 1953–54, as against 35,000 tons in the previous year.

Mining activities are developing and during 1953 the following amounts were extracted:

| Mineral          | Amount   |
|------------------|----------|
| Kaolin clay      | 5,934 tons|
| Iron ore         | 123,200 tons|
| Lead ore         | 645 tons  |
| Graphite         | 200 tons  |
| Wolfram ore      | 313,721 lb.|
| Molybdenum       | 3,317 lb. |
| Tin ore          | 156 lb.   |
Local industries are responsible for approximately 30% of all Hong Kong's exports, there being about 2,000 registered factories manufacturing a wide variety of articles. The following figures show exports of locally-manufactured goods during 1953: cotton yarn, 31,000,000 lb. valued at $100·1 million; cotton singlets, 4,172,979 dozen, value $72·2 million; shirts, 1,134,458 dozen, value $54·2 million; enamel ware, value $44·2 million; electric torches, 2,346,088 dozen, value $35·9 million; cotton piece-goods, 133 million square yards, value $157·5 million; rubber footwear and canvas shoes, 829,770 dozen pairs, value $35·2 million; torch batteries, 5,101,075 dozen, value $13·7 million; preserved fruits, value $15·1 million; paints, varnishes, etc., value $10·8 million; aluminium ware, value $3·9 million; and vacuum flasks, 121,879 dozen, value $6·3 million.

Total cement production during the year was 62,756 tons.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are twelve Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies with a membership of over 2,300. Eleven of these Societies have federated and formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies. In addition six Boar Service Societies, one Irrigation Society, one Co-operative Building Society, two Salaried Workers' Thrift Loan Societies, one Draft Animal Society, and one Fertilizer and Feed Purchasing Society have been formed. Seventeen Fishermen's Thrift and Loan Co-operative Societies have been formed and fishermen are gradually becoming aware of the benefits of co-operation. The total number of members of these 42 Societies (including one Federation) is 3,514.

The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market at Kowloon from co-operative societies and three collecting centres and two depots in the New Territories. The three centres are run by the farmers and are being encouraged to develop into co-operative societies.

Four Wholesale Fish Markets are now in operation, the latest having been opened in June, 1952, at Aberdeen, the main fishing port on Hong Kong Island. A revolving loan fund of a quarter of a million dollars has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; this fund has now almost completed its seventh revolution.
