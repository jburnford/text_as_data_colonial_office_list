THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

Area

The total area of the Islands is 826 square miles.

Population

At the end of 1953 the total population was about 299,000. The majority are of the negro race; less than 5% are white. There are a few persons of East Indian descent, and a few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica.

Geographical Features

The islands are of volcanic origin and the more sheltered coasts are fringed by reefs. Torrential streams from the more rugged areas tend to lose their gradient nearer the coast and the deposition of their sediments has led to the formation of fertile river flats and occasional river terraces. The residual clays on the rugged volcanic areas are comparatively fertile. One of the volcanoes in the Windward region (St. Vincent) was active in 1902. At the Soufrieres of Dominica and St. Lucia and in parts of Grenada hot sulphuretted gases still emerge and there are numerous hot springs which contain salts.

Climate

The prevailing trade winds provide a delightful climate. There is little variation between night and day.

Principal Towns

The capitals of the four colonies are:

Grenada—St. George's (residence of Governor) ... 5,772 (1946 census)

Dominica—Roseau ... 9,752 (1946 census)

St. Lucia—Castries and suburbs ... 18,000 (1952 estimate)

St. Vincent—Kingstown and suburbs ... 14,766 (1946 census)

History

As early as 1763 one Governor was appointed for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government. On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad. On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

Constitution and Administration

Each of the four colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada, where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Windward Islands. The government of each colony is administered by a resident Administrator subject to instructions from the Governor. There is no common Legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. Each colony has a Legislative Council presided over by the Administrator, in which the majority of members are elected by universal adult suffrage; and each colony has an Executive Council which may be summoned and consulted by either the Governor or the Administrator. A Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the Chief Justices of the several West Indian Islands except Jamaica was set up in 1920 and a Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established in 1939. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889. In 1951 revised constitutions were introduced in each of the four islands.

Land Policy

There is a small amount of Crown land reserved mainly for purposes of forest and water conservation. There is no restriction on the transfer of land except to aliens, for which the consent of the Governor in Executive Council is necessary.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. The other main forms of taxation are trade tariffs and excise duties. Some of the major crops are subject to an export tax.

Currency

The currency comprises dollar notes ($1 = 4s. 2d.) and British coinage. Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, and Trinidad) in currency unification.

Development

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 the Windward Islands received an original allocation of £1,850,000. This was sub-allocated to the various colonies as follows:

| Colony     | Amount (£) |
|------------|-----------|
| Grenada    | 381,890   |
| St. Vincent| 345,858   |
| St. Lucia  | 374,632   |
| Dominica   | 339,120   |
A sum of £408,500 was reserved by the Governor for schemes covering more than one territory and for unforeseen contingencies.

Supplementary allocations have been made as follows:

- Grenada: £180,000
- St. Vincent: £120,000
- St. Lucia: £934,000
- Dominica: £415,000
- Windwards General: £45,000

Libraries, Museums, etc.

In each of the principal towns of the four Islands of the Group there is a free public library and there are several branch libraries throughout the Islands, all maintained by Government. The Dominica Museum, the only one in the Windward Islands, possesses a fine collection of pictures, specimens of birds and fishes and relics of the original Caribs.

Health

The principal diseases are malaria, enteric fever, helminthic diseases, yaws, venereal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis and dysentery.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, in co-operation with the World Health Organization, have made grants towards the implementation of insect control programmes in St. Lucia and Grenada. Applications have been submitted for the carrying out of similar projects in Dominica and St. Vincent.

Communications

Airfields have been constructed in Grenada and St. Lucia, and these two colonies are served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule. A temporary service with Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft is operated by the St. Vincent Government between Trinidad, Grenada, Carriacou, Barbados, St. Vincent and Dominica.

Broadcasting

Construction of a Windward Islands Broadcasting Station, with headquarters in St. George's, Grenada, commenced in 1954. Transmissions will take place on short-waves from a 5 kW transmitter, and will cover all four Islands. Subsequently, low-power local stations will be erected in St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica.

The capital outlay on these stations, and the running costs for the first few years, have been provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

DOMINICA

Area and Population

The area is approximately 305 square miles, and the estimated population is 57,000.

Geographical Features

Dominica is mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island.

Climate

The climate on the whole is good. During the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

History

Dominica was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd July, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1761, and by the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the garrison. In 1783 it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

Until 1940 Dominica was grouped with the Leeward Islands.

Constitution

The present constitution was introduced on 29th September, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial...
Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are income tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 2d. to 10s. in the £ of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 6s. on every £ of chargeable income. Ad valorem duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 5% to 35% preferential and 3% to 75% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Export duty, at a varying rate, is payable on most products exported. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars and black leaf tobacco.

Public Finance

| Revenue (including grant-in-aid from H.M. Treasury and C.D & W. issues) | Expenditure |

| 1952 | 2,377 | 2,292 |
| 1953 | 2,814 | 2,607 |

Of the total revenue in 1953 $1,095,382 was derived from Customs, $258,511 from Taxes and $104,816 from Fees of Court, etc.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Education $271,288, Medical $245,503, Police $199,229, Public Works $357,887. Prior to 1940 Governor, Legislature, Audit and Judicial were borne by the Federal Government, Leeward Islands.

Development Plans

£774,120 has been allocated to the Colony under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945 for the ten-year period ending 31st March, 1956. Development Schemes fall into six main heads on which commitments are as follows:

- Agriculture and Forestry: £148,049
- Public Works: £334,659
- Education: £95,194
- Medical: £52,844
- Social Welfare: £15,982
- Miscellaneous: £127,392

In addition to the above, the Colony is engaged upon a further programme of Public Works amounting to £205,000 financed from Loan Funds, as set out below:

- Ferro-concrete Jetty at Roseau: £350,400
- Goodwill Housing Scheme (Town expansion and slum clearance): £177,600
- Prison and Police Barracks and Fire Station: £115,200
- Roads: £302,400
- Packing Plant: £24,000
- Unallocated: £14,400

There is a large new construction programme of Public Works which may be further increased. A fair portion of the Development and Welfare Funds allocated to Agriculture, Education and to Medical programmes are for building construction of offices, officers' quarters, schools, etc., which have to be built by the Public Works Department.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation is engaged on development of Melville Hall Estate, in the northern part of the island. They completed the construction of a hydro-electric plant near Roseau early in 1953.

Education

There are 43 Elementary Schools with a total enrolment of 10,835 pupils, and four Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 656 pupils. There are also 12 private or temporary schools with an enrolment of 426 pupils. There is no technical school nor any local institution of Higher Education. The number of students from this Colony known to be in Universities or University Colleges abroad is:

- United Kingdom: 12
- Canada: 6
- Jamaica (University College of the West Indies): 8
- Trinidad (I.C.T.A.): 2
- France: 1
- Belgium: 1

In 1953 Government expenditure on Education was approximately $271,000 as compared with $35,976 in 1935.

Health

There are five Government hospitals including a Leper Home with a total of 183 beds. The latest available annual figure for out-patients is 14,684 and for in-patients 4,314. Regular clinics are held throughout the year by District Medical Officers at the 19 dispensaries distributed all over the island. A Maternal, Child Hygiene and School Health Service with its Headquarters in Roseau is operated by a Senior Health Visitor, assisted by three Health Visitors, under the direction of the Senior Medical Officer. As part of its functions the clinic distributes free milk, cod liver oil and food yeast to needy and undernourished children. Under a U.N.I.C.E.F. school feeding programme, all children in primary schools receive a half-pint of reconstituted milk daily. There are also an Anti-Yaws Campaign and a Dental Service.
The Health Department with its auxiliary the Public Health Engineering Unit is under the control of the Senior Medical Officer who is also Chairman of the Central Board of Health. This Board is statutorily constituted and is responsible to Government for the initiation and carrying out of public health measures.

Government expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953 was $273,958 compared with $19,243 in 1936.

Communications

There are 102 miles of oiled surface roads, 244 miles of secondary roads, and 332 miles of tracks. Leeward coast villages are linked by a coastal motor launch service. An extensive programme of road development is being carried out.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture is the principal occupation and provides employment for about 5,000 wage-earners in addition to about 3,000 peasants. Road and building construction workers are estimated at 2,000. There are two trade unions with an estimated membership of 5,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are limes, bananas, coconuts, grapefruit, oranges, cocoa, vanilla, mangoes, avocado pears and various ground provisions for domestic use. The main products are raw and sweetened lime juice, lime oil, copra and rum. The banana industry maintained steady progress during 1953 and attained an export figure of well over one million stems, which represented an increase of 32% over the previous year's export figure.

The livestock population consists of about 5,000 head of cattle. A Government stock farm has been established in order to stimulate expansion of the livestock industry.

There is considerable production of timber for local use, but no export trade.

The production of handicrafts from local straws is a widespread minor industry. The annual value of production is estimated at $28,800.

The Government Fruit Packing and Marketing Depot continues to offer facilities for marketing abroad of citrus and other fruit. In 1953 there were the following co-operative societies operating:

- Three Credit Unions with 874 members;
- One Consumer Society with 100 members;
- Three Marketing and Processing Societies (Lime Juice and Lime Oil) with 170 members and sales of $44,000.

GRENA DA

Area
The total area is 133 square miles. The Colony includes certain of the small islands known as the Grenadines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area of about 13 square miles.

Population
The estimated population (mid-1953) of 83,046 is for the most part "coloured". There is a small white population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers.

Geographical Features
In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat disordered topography of mountains and fairly deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of mountains traverses the whole length, closer to the western than the eastern coastline. The highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), Fedon's Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along the east and south-east the mountains slope gradually towards the sea. The south coast is deeply indented by numerous natural harbours. The island is well-watered by quick-flowing streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approximately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800 feet in the centre of the Island.

Climate
Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month, and November the wettest.

History
Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. Grenada was, however, included in the Carlisle Grant of 1627. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased the island from the French West India Company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George's. This venture did not pay and Du Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac from whom it was in turn purchased in 1665 by the French Company and passed to the Crown of France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 and re-occupied in 1784. In 1795-96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. Many atrocities were committed, including the cold-blooded murder of the Lieutenant-Governor. The rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there has been peace in Grenada.

Constitution
The present constitution was introduced on 1st August, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Attorney-General and the Colonial Treasurer); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, (President), two ex officio members (the Attorney-General and the Colonial Treasurer); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Council elects one of its members to be Deputy President. The presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

In 1952 a Public Service Commission was appointed to advise the Governor in matters affecting certain appointments and staff dispositions.

Taxation
Forms of direct taxation include income tax, estate duties and land and house tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale of 3% to 60%, in the $ for individuals, companies paying a special rate of 37½% in the $. An agreement was reached in 1949 with various Governments for the avoidance of double taxation. Taxation is enforced in other forms through import, export and excise duties, etc. licenses.
Public Finance

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 815,040     | 825,394         |
| 1949 | 2,647,857   | 3,163,295       |
| 1950 | 3,775,261   | 2,979,383       |
| 1951 | 3,942,028   | 3,840,416       |
| 1952 | 3,877,884   | 3,788,359       |
| 1953 | 3,906,799   | 4,346,816       |

The revenue balance declined over the period 1948–53 although collections of import, export, additional export, excise duties and income tax were considerably higher than before. Revenue from these sources is, of course, entirely dependent on world markets for the island’s principal exports of cocoa and nutmegs. The revenue deficit was due to a heavy increase in expenditure resulting from the demand for increased wages and salaries, higher standards of social services and the enhanced cost of all imported commodities, including Government stores.

At the end of 1953 the Public Debt amounted to $2,870,271 and accumulated Sinking Funds to $762,749.

Development Plans

Grenada received an original allocation of $1,833,071 (£381,890) under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a Ten-Year Development Plan. Between 1946 and 1953 this amount was augmented by a further sum of $1,004,309 making a total figure of $2,837,381 (£591,121). This includes an additional grant of £20,000 from the Windwards General Allocation.

At the end of 1953 the position of these grants was as under:

C.D. & W. Allocation... £591,121

Expenditure:
- Agriculture: £301,832
- Education: £62,544
- Medical: £10,461
- Communications: £68,878

Total: £497,103

Less savings on Schemes: £9,210

£487,893

31st December, 1953, uncommitted balance: £103,228

A loan of $1,540,800 was raised in 1952 for the execution of the following projects:

- Civil Servants Housing: $192,000
- Electricity: $200,000
- Grenville Jetty: $23,000
- Hospitals: $148,783
- Morne Rouge Development: $215,359
- Police Headquarters and Barracks: $192,000
- Queen’s Park Bridge: $100,155
- Slum Clearance: $206,800
- Stamp Duty on transfer of stock: $4,800
- Water Supplies: $149,988
- Unallocated: $67,612
- Expenses of Loan: $40,303

Total: $1,540,800

At the end of 1953 the uncommitted balances stood at $985,997.

Other Development

It has not so far been possible to attract the assistance of any organization of suitable capacity by way of investing in any desirable major development scheme at present beyond the competence of the Colony to finance. Two such schemes are the development of the Morne Rouge area in the interest of tourism and the provision of a deep water pier at St. George’s.

Education

There are 52 Primary Schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 18,446 and average attendance amounting to 13,424, or 72·8%. Compulsory attendance is enforced in the capital and one other area where accommodation is regarded as adequate. Eleven of the Primary Schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned structures of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are three handicraft centres. In addition two schools have well equipped handicraft rooms. There are also three domestic science centres, with adequate facilities provided at two other schools. A visual education unit serves the whole colony. A filmstrip library service with four projectors is maintained. Six Secondary Schools (one Government and five grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,181 of which 183 are scholarship or exhibition holders. Two of the schools are for boys only, three for girls only and one co-educational. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate standard and the Grenada Boys’ Secondary School, the Presentation College and the St. Joseph’s Convent also prepare pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1953 was $516,218. In 1935 the total expenditure on education amounted to $73,080.

The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships, one tenable at a university in the British Commonwealth, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad.

Health

There have been no epidemics of infectious diseases recently. Malaria is still prevalent, but with the assistance of W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. organizations, an Insect Control Programme is now in operation. The Colony Hospital is at St. George’s. One medical officer is engaged in a yaws and venereal disease campaign. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew’s, is a modern building recently constructed, and provides 32 beds. There is another small hospital at Carriacou. There are 21 district medical visiting stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Here, too, maternity and child welfare work is done. There are two main Health Centres—St. George’s and Gouyave—and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.

Expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1953 amounted to $573,214 compared with $97,987 in 1935.
Communications

The airfield is at Pearls, and has a runway 5,280 feet long and 130 feet wide.

There are approximately 472 miles of good roads divided into four classes according to standard of construction. About 234 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.

The chief ports are St. George's (possessing a good harbour and a deep water pier), Grenville and Hillsborough (Carriacou). Cargo services are operated by the Harrison Line steamers from the United Kingdom and by calls of the Canadian National Steamship Company and the Alcoa Line from Canadian and United States ports. The Canadian National Line and Caribbean Fruit Company boats also carry passengers. Several small motor, auxiliary and sailing vessels ply regularly between the islands.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Government-operated Central Marketing Organization was initiated in 1951 for the purchase, sale and, where necessary, storage of surplus quantities of locally grown foodcrops. The nutmeg industry is controlled by the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association which purchases, processes and markets all nutmegs and mace produced in the Colony.

ST. LUCIA

Area and Population

The area is 238 square miles and the population 84,812 (1953 end-year estimate).

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, the highest peak being Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet). The most spectacular mountains are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September-October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

History

The date and the person who discovered St. Lucia are unknown, for according to the known evidence of Columbus's voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April, 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of...
their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June, 1803, was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

**Constitution**

The present constitution was introduced on 1st August, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three *ex officio* members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two *ex officio* members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is president of the Council, and there is a deputy-president appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

**Taxation**

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 6d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

| 1953 | 739,782    | 703,463        |

It was estimated that in 1953 34·5% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise duties, and 15·4% from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: 17·0%
- Administration: 37·0%
- Public Works: 18·5%
- Development: 27·5%

The Public Debt of the Colony at 31st December, 1953, stood at $3,325,434 which includes $2,782,281 loaned for Castries Reconstruction and $21,600 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds for Vide Boutielle Housing. The accumulated Sinking Funds towards its redemption stood at $252,166.

At 31st December, 1953, an amount of $63,394 not included in the above assets was due by Her Majesty's Government to this Colony in respect of unreimbursed expenditure on Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes.

At 31st December, 1953, unpaid loans from revenue not shown in the above assets amounted to $1,323,539.

**Development Plans**

Under the 1945 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, St. Lucia was allocated £37,632. In 1950 an allocation of £150,000 towards a road programme was agreed and an additional grant of £200,000 was made available to implement the agricultural development plans of the Colony based upon the recommendations of a Team of Experts which visited the Island in 1951. In 1950 the United Kingdom Government agreed to provide up to a maximum of £1,025,000 to assist the St. Lucia Government to rebuild public buildings and housing accommodation in Castries which were destroyed by the fire of 1948 and a further £84,000 was provided by Her Majesty's Government for that purpose. The Colonial Development Corporation were active in the reconstruction of Castries from 1948. The reconstruction programme was completed in 1953.

**Education**

In the 1952–53 session there were two students from St. Lucia at the University College of the West Indies, Jamaica. There were 17 students at Universities in the United Kingdom, seven in Canada, five in the United States and two in France. Of these 10 held Government scholarships, the balance being private students. There were two Secondary Schools with 629 pupils on the roll, and 49 Primary Schools with a total of 14,505 pupils enrolled. The Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies conducted adult education classes throughout the year, and the aggregate attendance was 1,675. The total estimated expenditure for 1953 was £59,687, compared with £6,692 in 1935.

**Health**

The most prevalent diseases are heart diseases, diseases of early infancy, tuberculosis, helminthic diseases, and venereal diseases.

The incidence of malaria has fallen sharply as a result of an Insect Control Campaign carried out with W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. assistance.

Available hospital beds amount to 162. There are 14 dispensaries and Health Outposts and a Day Nursery.

In 1953, 49,608 persons attended at clinics or health outposts. The estimated expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953 was £49,618 as compared with £11,624 in 1935.
Communications

There are two airfields, the Vigie Airport, and the Beane Field Airport. Air services with the other islands are maintained by British West Indian Airways Incorporated, and chartered flights by K.L.M. and British Guiana Airways. The island's road system comprises the following:

| Miles |
|-------|
| Main roads | 105.64 |
| Second Class Roads | 95.65 |
| Unclassified Roads | 169.85 |
| Total | 371.14 |

Cargo steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa Steamships, the Harrison Line, the Caribbean Fruit Company, and numerous inter-island craft are the main means of communication by sea. Castries handles about 945,000 gross tons of shipping annually.

ST. VINCENT

Area
The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population
The population at the end of 1953 was 73,136.

Geographical Features
Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufriere (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 87 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate
Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At Kingstown, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 85·8°, and the rainfall 104·17 inches, in 1953.

History
St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British 14 years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in 1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

Constitution
The present constitution was introduced on 1st October, 1951. There is an Executive Council normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Colonial Treasurer); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Colonial Treasurer); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is president of the Council, and there is a deputy-president appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation
A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 78 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 30 cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 14s. 2d. per proof gallon.

Public Finance ($ B.W.I.)

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | 489,677 | 464,458     |
| 1949 | 1,826,664 | 1,802,191   |

| 1953 | 2,787,378 | 2,618,773   |

In 1953 Customs and excise duties produced $1,120,732 (or 40·2%) of the total revenue while direct taxation yielded $286,731 (or 10·3%).

The Public Debt at 31st December, 1953, was $543,267, equivalent to $7·43 per head of the population.

Development Plans
The Ten-Year Development Plan, compiled in 1946, has been revised and replaced by the Five-Year Plan, 1955-60. It is estimated that the sum of £468,000 will be made available from public loans, £646,805 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and an additional £100,000 for a Land Use Survey. These funds will be spent in the following proportions:

- Communications: 35·5%
- Social Services: 27%
- Economic Development: 24·5%
- Surveys: 13%

Education
In 1953 there were two Government Secondary Schools and one grant-aided Secondary School with an enrolment of 553 pupils and 41 Primary Schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 15,462 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions.
During 1952-53 some 32 St. Vincent students were attending Universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1953 expenditure on educational services amounted to approximately $341,242, of which the contribution of the United Kingdom under Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $18,229. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

**Health**

Of tropical diseases yaws is prevalent, and tuberculosis is a major health problem but does not appear to be increasing (average deaths over a five-year period were 53 annually). Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 20 dispensaries, at which approximately 20,696 cases were treated in 1953. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery) . . . . 134
- Maternity . . . . . . . . 16
- Tuberculosis . . . . . . . . 40
- Mental . . . . . . . . 100
- Leprosy . . . . . . . . 20
- Pauper Home . . . . . . . . 125

In 1953 in-patients numbered 3,968; out-patients, 3,922.

Total expenditure in 1953 on Government Health and Medical Services was $391,692; in 1935, $66,945.

**Communications**

The seadrome is situated at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown.

There are about 400 miles of roads of which some 100 miles are motorable throughout the year; 58 miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 27 miles of metalled roads and about 325 miles of earth roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly cargo service is provided from Canada, by the Canadian National Steamship Company, with limited passenger accommodation. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service every six weeks by the Harrison Line. The Alcoa Steamships call southbound from Canada fortnightly via the islands and proceed to New York approximately every five weeks. The Caribbean Fruit Company have recently started a passenger and cargo service which operates between Trinidad, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Barbados. Schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

**Principal Occupations**

Estimated numbers employed in the principal occupations are:

- Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing . . . . 13,000
- Manufacturing Industries . . . . . . . . 2,000
- Hotel and Personal Services . . . . . . . . 2,100
- Transport and Communications . . . . . . . . 650
- Building and Road Construction . . . . . . . . 2,750
- Commerce . . . . . . . . 1,200
- Public Services and other Services . . . . . . . . 1,350

Trade Unions

The United Workers’, Peasants’ and Ratepayers’ Union.

The General Workers’ Union.

The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers’ Union.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are arrowroot, cotton, copra and coconut, sugar, sweet potatoes, groundnuts and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is:
- goats 11,039; cattle 7,741; sheep 3,294; horses and mules 253; swine 9,369.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

There is fairly extensive fishing in-shore but very little is done off-shore. Catches are often insufficient to meet demand.

There are a good many privately-owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a soap and cigarette factory; an oil expressing and refining plant for cotton seed and coconut oil, with their by-products of stock feed and manure, and a deodorizing plant for the treatment of coconut and fish oils at the Government Cotton Ginnery; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks.
