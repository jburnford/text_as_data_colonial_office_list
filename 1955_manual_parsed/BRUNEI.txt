Geographical Features
Brunei has a coastline of about 100 miles, and is split into two and surrounded on the landward sides by Sarawak. In the west the valleys of the Belait and the Tutong rivers, representing more than half the area of the country, consist of extensive swamps gradually changing through a series of ridge and swamp formations into low hills at the sources of the rivers. The Labi hills in the extreme west cover an area of some 300 square miles and at no point exceed 1,300 feet in height. In the east the Brunei district is characterized by a number of steep rocky hills of no great height rising from alluvial flats, while Tenburong, except near the coast, is hilly, becoming mountainous as one approaches Bukit Pagon, a spur from the main Bornean range.

Climate
There are no well-defined seasons, but the rainfall tends to be heaviest from October to the middle of January. The annual rainfall varies from 100 inches at the coast to over 200 inches in certain parts of the interior. The temperature rarely exceeds 90°; the usual daily range is between 76° and 86°.

History
The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the sixteenth century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the whole of the island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some parts of the Philippines. Towards the end of the sixteenth century its power began to decline, the outlying territories gradually fell away, and by the beginning of the nineteenth century the kingdom of Brunei had dwindled so as to include only what is now Sarawak and part of British North Borneo.

At this period the town itself seems to have degenerated to the condition of a slave market for the sale of captives of the Illanun and Sulu pirates. Anarchy was rife in the outlying districts, and in 1841 Sarawak proper was ceded to Mr. (later Sir James) Brooke in return for his services in quelling an insurrection at Kuching, and he was declared Rajah of Sarawak. In 1846 the island of Labuan was ceded to Great Britain as a base for anti-piracy measures, and in 1877 the whole of the northern portion of Borneo was ceded to form the nucleus of what was to become British North Borneo. At various later dates further cessions were made to the Rajah of Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company till the territories of the State were eventually reduced to their present circumscribed limits.

In 1847 the Sultan entered into a Treaty with Great Britain for the furtherance of commercial relations and the mutual suppression of piracy. An additional clause provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction over British subjects in Brunei, which provision was modified by an Agreement of 1856. By a further Treaty made in 1888 Brunei was placed under the protection of Great Britain, and the Sultan agreed that the foreign relations of the State should be conducted by Her Majesty's Government. Provision was also made for the setting up of Consular Courts with jurisdiction over British subjects and foreign subjects enjoying British protection. In 1905-06 a supplementary Agreement was entered into whereby the Sultan undertook to accept a British officer, to be styled...
Resident, who should be the agent and representative of the British Government under the High Commissioner (at that time the Governor of the Straits Settlements, now the Governor of Sarawak).

**Constitution**

The supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan in Council. The State Council consists of 12 members, including the British Resident, with the Sultan as President. The assent of the Council is required for the enactment of legislation and important questions of policy are referred to it.

The general functions of administration are carried out by a British Resident under the supervision of the Governor of Sarawak as High Commissioner. By a Treaty of 1906 the Resident's advice must be asked and acted upon in all questions other than those affecting the Mohammedan religion. The seat of Government is in Brunei Town and there are Assistant Residents at Kuala Belait and at Headquarters.

**Land Policy**

In the State a transfer charge, lease or sub-lease of land to a person who is not a natural born subject of the Sultan, or who has not resided in the State for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than seven years during the ten years immediately preceding the date on which such instrument is delivered to the Land Officer, shall be subject to, and shall not be valid or registered without, the approval of the Sultan in Council.

**Taxation**

At present there is no Income Tax upon persons other than Companies. Companies are taxed at the rate of 30% upon their chargeable income. Import, export and excise duties are charged. A royalty is paid by the British Malayan Petroleum Company, based upon the amount of oil produced. A variety of licences are issued, mostly of a municipal nature.

**Development Plans**

A five-year Development Plan received the approval of the State Council in August, 1953. The large sum of $100,000,000 has been set aside from the general revenue surplus to provide for an ambitious programme of works for the benefit of the State and its inhabitants. The plan will include provision for social services, pensions and disability allowances, free meals for schoolchildren, resettlement of landless inhabitants, improvement of agriculture, communications, roads, telephones, radio-telephones, aerodromes, town improvement, water and electricity supplies, new schools, new scholarships, new hospital, travelling dispensaries, anti-malarial work, child welfare. This plan is in addition to the works which would normally be undertaken annually.

The rebuilding of devastated areas was completed in 1954.

**Education**

The number and types of institutions providing educational facilities are:

(a) 34 Malay Vernacular Schools, with a total enrolment of 2,679; 2,143 boys and 536 girls. These schools are fully maintained by Government. The Malay language is the medium of instruction; English is taught as a second language beginning in the Fourth Year.

(b) 7 Chinese Schools, with a total enrolment of 1,727; 1,058 boys and 669 girls. These schools are largely maintained by subscriptions from the Chinese communities in the areas in which the schools are situated, and by school fees. All receive grants-in-aid from Government. The British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited, gives financial aid to the two Chinese Schools situated in the Oilfield area. The medium of instruction in all Chinese Schools is Chinese (Mandarin). English is taught as a second language beginning in the Third Year.

(c) 6 English Schools; 3 of which are run by the Roman Catholic Mission, 2 by Government and 1 by the Oil Company. The total enrolment of these schools is 1,511; 967 boys and 544 girls. The Mission Schools are largely maintained by Mission funds and school fees. All receive grants-in-aid from Government. Two of them, situated in the Oilfield area, receive financial aid from the Oil Company. One of the Government Schools and one of the Mission Schools have Secondary Forms, with a total enrolment of 178; 148 boys and 30 girls, (not included in the total for English Schools given above).

It may be mentioned, that all the schools listed under (a) (b) and (c) above are Primary Schools. There are as yet no separate Secondary Schools in Brunei.

(d) One Trade (Technical) School. This is fully maintained and belongs to the British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited. The present enrolment is 96; 44 first, 30 second and 22 third year apprentices. The practical instruction given includes: Fitting, Turning, Motor and Diesel Mechanics, Welding and Blacksmithing. On the theoretical side are included Theory of Mechanics, Workshop Practice, Electricity, Mathematics and Machine Drawings.
A number of Brunei students are attending educational institutions overseas. They fall into two categories (a) teachers (Malay Vernacular School Teachers) attending Training Colleges in Malaya and Sarawak; there are 34 at present undergoing such training, 4 in Malaya, 2 male teachers and 2 female; 30 in Sarawak, all males; (b) students in English Schools for whom as yet no suitable classes are available in Brunei English Schools. There are 12 such students, 3 in Malaya and 9 in Sarawak. In addition there is a Brunei student (a Chinese) taking an engineering course in the University of New South Wales. He has been recently awarded a scholarship under the Colombo Plan.

Expenditure on education in 1953 was $1,008,332 compared with $36,059 in 1940 and $7,289 in 1930.

Health

Brunei State may be considered relatively healthy. The following diseases were of greatest incidence in 1953:

- Tropical Anaemias: 4,590
- Malaria, all forms: 3,062
- Helminthic diseases: 2,463
- Respiratory diseases: 1,988
- Inflammatory diseases of the eye: 1,382
- Deficiency states: 981
- Tuberculosis: 1,003

Of these it is considered that Tuberculosis is the greatest problem because of the difficult socio-economic conditions retarding attempts at eradication. A T.B. Clinic commenced work in 1953 and proper buildings followed in 1954.

There is one 150-bedded State Hospital in Brunei Town, one 14 bedded Dispensary in Kuala Belait and the Oil Company also has a 150-bedded Hospital there. There are two out-station dispensaries with 16 beds, and a small Tuberculosis Hospital with 22 beds has been constructed at Kuala Belait. Three floating dispensaries serve the riverain population and are not only bringing medicine to the homes of the people but also serving as a spearhead of propaganda.

Hospital attendances have more than doubled in recent years as the table below shows:

| Year | Hospital in-patients | Hospital out-patients | Ante-natal attendances | Travelling dispensary attendances |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1951 | 1,672                | 40,204                | 7,329                  | 3,849                            |
| 1953 | 3,328                | 111,971               | 11,168                 | 17,215                           |

During 1953 the Medical Department budget amounted to $1,262,133 an increase of $535,260 over the previous year.

Communications

An aerodrome of International Code Letter E size on a Trunk Route is under construction, and should be in use in 1955.

The Anduki airfield is operated by the British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited, for internal service and to Labuan. They also maintain a light railway from Seria to Badas about eight miles long.

There are 86 miles of roads; metalled 43 miles, earth 43 miles.

The main ports are Brunei Town and Kuala Belait. The bulk of general cargo for Brunei is transhipped from Labuan and conveyed to the two main ports by a fleet of small coasting vessels run by the Straits Steamship Company. Monthly visits are made to the Port of Brunei Town direct from Singapore by this Company's vessels of up to 1,700 G.E.T. The British Malayan Petroleum Company also maintains a considerable fleet of L.C.Ts., and these ply mainly between Brunei Town, Labuan and Kuala Belait. In addition, numerous native-owned motor launches, tongkangs, and outboard motor boats carry on a coastal trade around the Brunei and adjacent Colonies' ports. The State runs a motor launch service connecting with the air service and, as far as possible, the steamer service in Labuan, carrying mail and passengers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. Numbers employed in other occupations in 1953 were:

- Government service (Public Works): 1,261
- Oil mining: 4,952
- Rubber: 274
