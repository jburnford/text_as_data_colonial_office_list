CAYMAN ISLANDS

Area
The Islands consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

Population
At the 1943 census the population was 6,670: Grand Cayman 5,311, Cayman Brac 1,296, Little Cayman 63. Roughly classified according to racial origin, 1,052 are of African, 3,518 of mixed and 2,100 of European descent. The estimated population at the end of 1952 was 7,651.

Geographical Features
The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is about 22 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to eight miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

Climate
From November to March it is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, and temperatures range from 60° to 75°. In the summer the range of temperature is some 10° higher and during certain periods mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1952 was 64-35 inches. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, resulting in considerable depopulation of the latter. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system.

Principal Towns
Georgetown and West Bay have populations of 1,462 and 1,866 respectively.

History
The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown, the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1734. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for long a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1774 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 933, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

Constitution
The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 27) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica, and these, with 27 elected members known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly of Justices and Vestry under the presidency of the Commissioner. Enactments are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica. The Legislature of Jamaica may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Cayman Islands and may amend or repeal any laws locally passed. The present constitution dates from 1832.

Land Policy
All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.
Taxation

A poll tax of 8s. per adult male between the ages of 16 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 15% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

Public Finance

| Year   | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938-39| 13,253      | 11,859          |
| 1949-50| 36,936      | 38,958          |
| 1950-51| 62,279      | 49,127          |
| 1951-52| 41,327      | 57,806          |
| 1952-53| 53,613      | 51,738          |

* Revised Estimates.

In 1953-54, £44,050 was estimated to be derived from Customs receipts and £9,000 from the sale of postage stamps. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Treasury, Customs and Post Office £9,864, Education £7,477, Medical £5,932 and Public Works Recurrent £5,675.

The Public Debt as at 31st March, 1954, was as follows:

- Hurricane Loan 1932: outstanding £914.
- Public Works Loan, 1932: outstanding £2,437.

Reserve Funds at that date totalled £39,145.

Development

The Islands have benefited to the extent of £96,568 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. This sum has been devoted to the erection of a new hospital on Grand Cayman, airfield construction, to the improvement of educational facilities, road construction, agricultural education, and health measures mainly directed to the destruction and control of mosquitoes. Excellent results have been achieved in all fields except agriculture, which, in a community persistently addicted to the sea rather than to the land, has made only limited progress.

Education

There is compulsory free elementary education in 12 Government Schools; expenditure in 1953-54 amounted to £7,477 compared with £1,275 in 1938. Attempts are being made to run three private Secondary Schools in Grand Cayman. One of them receives financial support from Government.

Libraries

There is a well-equipped public library in Georgetown, Grand Cayman.

Health

Expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1953-54 was £5,932, compared with £1,091 in 1938. The new hospital has accommodation for 28 patients. Medical Officers are seconded to the Dependency from Jamaica.

Communications

Construction of the airport at Crewe Road site in Grand Cayman has been completed and is used by B.W.I.A. and Lineas Aereas Costarricenses, S.A.

A regular three-weekly steamship service is maintained from Kingston to all three islands, and there are regular air services between Grand Cayman and Kingston, Belize, Miami, San José (Costa Rica) and Panama City. A 1,000-ft. airstrip has been constructed in Cayman Brac and a regular service by light aircraft will, it is hoped, be initiated in 1955. There is also more or less regular communication with Kingston, Florida and Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels. Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, but no roads exist in Little Cayman. Wireless stations are maintained by Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. There are no broadcasting services.

Principal Occupations

The chief industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment on the mainland of America, and in United States, Central and South American ships. Their remittances to their families enable a standard of living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, but no unions have been registered.

Crops and Products

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone soil. The main export products of importance are turtle and thatch rope. The manufacture of thatch rope is the mainstay of the poorer people and forms a considerable export to Jamaica.
