FIJI

Area

The aggregate land area is 7,040 square miles and most of it is contained in the two main islands of Viti Levu (4,011 square miles) and Vanua Levu (2,137 square miles). About 100 of the total of 300 islands are inhabited. The dependency of Rotuma (18 square miles) lies some 400 miles to the north.

Population

The estimated population at the 31st December, 1953, was 320,801.

| Population Group | Number |
|------------------|--------|
| Fijian           | 139,373|
| Indian           | 154,803|
| European         | 6,500  |
| Part-European    | 7,496  |
| Rotuman          | 3,990  |
| Chinese          | 3,857  |
| Others           | 4,782  |

Geographical Features

The islands comprising the Colony straddle the 180° meridian and lie about 1,200 miles south of the equator. Most of them are of volcanic origin but some are of limestone formation. There are no active volcanoes though hot springs occur in isolated places. All the larger islands are surrounded by coral reefs. Mountain ranges of moderate height—the highest peak is 4,341 feet above sea level—lie athwart the prevailing easterly trade winds and there is consequently a marked difference in the heavy forest vegetation on the windward and the light reeds and grasses on the leeward slopes of most islands. The total forest area is approximately 3,486 square miles, more than half the total land area of the Colony.

Climate

The climate is oceanic and tempered by cool east or south-east breezes which blow between May and October. During the rest of the year winds are variable and tropical storms, known locally as hurricanes, may occur. High humidity, which sometimes reaches saturation point, causes unpleasant living conditions while it lasts. Rainfall varies from an annual average of about 120 inches in Suva to 75 inches on the leeward coast of Viti Levu. The diurnal range of temperature at Suva, a few feet above sea level, is about 11°, but recordings between 60° and 90° are not unusual.

Principal Towns

The principal centres of population are:

- **Suva**, the capital: 30,000
- **Lautoka**, the largest of the sugar mill centres: 5,000
- **Vatukoula**, the site of the gold mining industry: 3,500

History

The first navigator to discover islands in the Fiji archipelago was Tasman in 1643. Cook charted a small island in 1774. Bligh of the *Bounty* sailed through part of the Group in 1789 during his memorable voyage in an open boat after being cast adrift by the mutineers.

Christianity was introduced into Fiji by Wesleyan missionaries from Tonga in 1835. Thakombau, an influential Fijian chief, offered to cede the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain in 1858 in exchange for support against his rivals and help in meeting his debts, but the offer was refused. After a further unsettled period, Thakombau renewed his offer of cession. The Deed of Cession was signed at Levuka on the 10th October, 1874. In 1882 the seat of government was moved to Suva because of its better harbour and greater facilities for expansion.

Rotuma was discovered by Captain Edwards in H.M.S. *Pandora* in 1791 during his search for the *Bounty* mutineers. In the nineteenth century the principal Rotuman chiefs repeatedly offered to cede the island to Great Britain, in order to prevent the continuance of a succession of religious wars. Rotuma was formally annexed in 1881.

Constitution

The government of the Colony is provided for under Letters Patent, 1937, and Royal Instructions. The Executive Council, presided over by the Governor, consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, as *ex officio* members, and six nominated members, two of whom are officials. When a vacancy occurs amongst the three unofficial members of Legislative Council serving on Executive Council, the five European, Fijian or Indian unofficial members of the Legislature, as the case may be, are invited to nominate one of their number as a suitable candidate for the vacancy. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor and consists of sixteen official members and fifteen unofficial members, of whom five are Europeans (three elected and two nominated), five Indians (three elected and two nominated) and five Fijians, who are nominated by the Governor from a panel of names of Fijians selected by secret ballot by the Council of Chiefs, itself consisting of elected and nominated members.

A local government system, first established in 1876, and since 1945 known as the Fijian Administration, has jurisdiction over all Fijians in the Colony, a policy based on indigenous institutions. In executive control is the Fijian...
Affairs Board, consisting of the Secretary for Fijian Affairs as chairman, the five Fijian members of Legislative Council, a Legal Adviser, and a Financial Adviser. The Secretary for Fijian Affairs is the executive officer of the Board and he is assisted, in each of the three administrative districts into which the Colony is divided, by a District Commissioner, who is in charge of the district and responsible to the Governor, through the Colonial Secretary, for the efficient administration of his district, including Fijian affairs. District Officers act as inspectors of the local government units but do not intervene in their management.

In Rotuma, where language and customs differ from those in Fiji, the District Officer is the chief executive authority and he also has limited magisterial powers. A Rotuman Regulation Board, consisting of the District Officer and a number of Rotumans, makes regulations of local application.

Land Policy

Soon after the date of the cession a commission investigated the title to lands claimed by foreigners and as a result freehold titles to about 400,000 acres of Fijian land were granted. The largest landowners are the Fijians and under the Native Land Trust Ordinance of 1940 the control of their lands, except areas demarcated and set aside for their own use and future maintenance, is vested in an independent Board, with the Governor as President, and administered on behalf of and for the benefit of the Fijian owners. The sale of Fijian-owned land is prohibited except to the Crown, and then only where it is required for a public purpose.

Taxation

Customs duties are levied on all imports. Income tax rates range from 1s. to 6s. on each £ of taxable income. Provision is made for personal, married, dependent children and widows' allowances. Companies other than non-Fijian shipping companies are liable for tax at the rate of 6s. 3d. in the £ on profits. Non-Fijian shipping companies are taxed at the rate of 4½d. in the £.

Surtax is chargeable on both individual and company incomes at varying rates. Death and gift duties are also payable.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | 889,514 | 966,957     |
| 1949 | 3,100,752 | 2,648,516 |
| 1950 | 3,797,906 | 3,589,459 |
| 1951 | 3,613,167 | 3,573,918 |
| 1952 | 4,185,846 | 4,410,496 |
| 1953 | 4,109,245 | 4,307,536 |

It is estimated that in 1953, £2,986,233 of the revenue was derived from Customs and excise duties, licences, income tax and other direct taxation. The main heads of expenditure were estimated at: Administration (Personal Emoluments) £1,400,537; Public Works £920,087; Medical £372,336; Education £92,896.

Currency

Fiji currency notes are issued in denominations of £20, £10, £5, £1, 10s. and 5s.; silver coins in denominations of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; and smaller denominations of 3d., 1d. and ½d. The Fiji £ is linked to sterling at the rate of £F.111 = £100.

Development Plans

A ten-year development plan estimated to cost £4,250,000 was approved by Legislative Council in 1949. It was proposed that this plan should be financed as follows:

- United Kingdom allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts: £1,100,000
- Annual Appropriations from Revenue: £450,000
- Appropriations from Surplus Balances: £636,690
- Loan Funds: £2,000,000
- From other sources: £63,310

Total: £4,250,000

There have been various alterations and additions to the original plan and expenditure in the ten-year period 1949–1958 is now estimated at £4,538,053. This total comprises the following estimated expenditure:

| Item                          | £     | Per cent. |
|-------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| Production and development of natural resources | 790,517 | 17·41    |
| Social Services               | 1,002,330 | 22·08   |
| Communications                | 1,719,012 | 37·87   |
| Water Supplies                | 583,453 | 12·85    |
| Engineering Staff and Quarters | 442,741 | 9·75     |

Total: £4,538,053

It has been decided to undertake the construction of new docks at Suva, an oil discharge berth, slipways, and to reclaim an area of foreshore for oil storage installations, together with the construction of a wharf at Lautoka. The estimated cost of these projects is £2,750,000. It is now estimated that the new Water Supply for Suva, together with the cost of reticulation, will amount to £715,000. It is proposed that the Suva water supply and the docks project should be financed from External Loans.

Other Development

During 1951 at the request of various Fijian Provincial Councils, a Fijian Development Fund was established into which is paid an amount not exceeding £10 a ton from the proceeds of the sale of Fijian-produced copra. Such deposits are credited to the producing group or individual and bear interest at 2%. The money thus accumulated may be expended only on works or schemes which will benefit the Fijians. The fund is administered by the Fijian Development Fund Board and by the end of July 1954 had accumulated a sum of £397,571.

Education

At the end of 1953 there were 57,164 children enrolled in schools, representing 18·21% of the total population, compared with 16·13% in 1946. There is a Government Teachers’ Training College at which in 1953 159 students attended the two-year residential course. Post-primary education is carried on by Missions, private bodies and the Government.

There are 422 registered schools where staff and accommodation are satisfactory and 55 recognized schools of a lower standard. In 1953 there were 1,235 registered teachers in Government service, 173 registered teachers in schools controlled by private bodies, and 173 registered teachers remain as “reserved” in the service of particular Missions. During 1953 gross expenditure
on education from general revenue amounted to £475,241, compared with £43,306 in 1935. This does not take account of local contributions by school authorities by way of expenditure on buildings. £50,864 (including £2,674 from United Kingdom grants) was expended from Development funds.

The number of students studying abroad under scholarship schemes is: United Kingdom 1; New Zealand 12; Australia 3.

Libraries and Museums

The Fiji Museum at Suva contains a fine historical and ethnological collection relating to Fiji and Western Pacific Territories. The Carnegie Library at Suva and the Shri Ramkrishna Library at Nandi are the main lending and reference libraries in the Colony. The Fiji Society, which is concerned with subjects of historic, scientific and antiquarian interest to Fiji, holds regular meetings and the record of its transactions has recently been published.

Health

The principal infectious diseases in Fiji are: ankylostomiasis, influenza, pertussis, infantile diarrhoea, pulmonary tuberculosis. Malaria does not occur. The total bed capacity of hospitals in the Colony is 1,987, of which 1,946 are in Government institutions; there are also 43 dispensaries in the rural areas in charge of Assistant Medical Practitioners. In-patients in 1953 in Government hospitals totalled 17,063 and the number of out-patients, including those treated at dispensaries, was approximately 391,686. Leprosy is treated at the Fiji Leprosy Hospital, Makongai, with the most modern methods, and a tuberculosis survey has been made with the assistance of a United Kingdom grant.

The Central Medical School, founded in 1888, provides a four-year course in medicine and dentistry to students from many South Pacific territories. There are at present 171 students in residence, including 29 from the United States Trust Territories in the Pacific.

The expenditure from general revenue on medical services in 1953 was £655,575, compared with £78,052 in 1935. These figures do not take into account expenditure from Development funds of £60,453, provided by grants from the United Kingdom.

Communications

The Colony's main airport is the international airport at Nandi, 135 miles by road from Suva. Aircraft on the trans-Pacific route from Canada and the United States to Australia and New Zealand call at Nandi on both northbound and southbound flights. Services on these routes were, until the 15th May 1954 operated by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Canadian Pacific Airlines Limited and Pan American World Airways (Incorporated). In May of 1954 British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines were taken over by Qantas who now operate a regular twice weekly service in each direction. In 1953, 782 aircraft from overseas landed at Nandi. During 1954 there was further reorganization of the services provided by Qantas and Tasman Empire Airways Limited between Fiji and Australia and New Zealand. T.E.A.L. now operate twice weekly between Nandi and New Zealand using DC6s, but two Solent flying boats have been retained to operate a twice monthly service between New Zealand and Suva, using Lauthala Bay Flying-boat Base, from which they continue on the Coral Route flight to Tahiti, calling also at Samoa and the Cook Islands. This flight is also extended to Tonga.

An internal air service was inaugurated by Fiji Airways, a local company, in 1951 and there are now regular flights between Suva, the international airport at Nandi, Lambasa, Savusavu and Taveuni.

There are 440 miles of permanent line on the light railway operated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for bringing sugar cane to the crushing mills. The average annual tonnage transported is about 980,000. A free passenger service is run twice weekly on a section of track 120 miles long.

There are 1,083 miles of road, 670 miles of which have an all-weather surface.

The chief ports are Suva and Lautoka but overseas shipping also calls at Levuka, Nasavusavu and Rotuma to load copra. Overseas vessels calling at Fiji ports during 1953 numbered 200, the majority being cargo vessels some of which also carry passengers; there were 198,114 tons of cargo landed and 327,558 tons shipped from Fiji. A monthly passenger and cargo service is maintained by the Union Steam Ship Company and connects Suva with Auckland, Tonga and Western Samoa. There is a six-weekly cargo service from the United Kingdom to New Zealand calling at Suva. Port facilities for overseas shipping at Suva were severely reduced as a result of the 1952 hurricane and the 1953 earthquake. Regular inter-island cargo, passenger and mail services are maintained by a small number of motor vessels and there are numerous craft up to about 120 tons operating on irregular itineraries to and from the main centres.

Broadcasting

A broadcasting service is undertaken by the Fiji Broadcasting Commission from Stations VRH and VRH4 at Suva, operating on frequencies of 930 and 3,980 kilocycles with power of 2 kilowatts and 500 watts. There are 4,319 licensed radio receivers in the Colony.

Principal Occupations

The economy of the Colony is based on agriculture and to a smaller extent on gold mining. The cultivation of sugar cane is almost entirely in the hands of Indian peasant farmers. Fijians produce about three-fifths of the second important export crop, copra, and about 70% of the employees at the gold mines are Fijians. The bulk of the population is not, however, a wage-earning one.

There are 29 registered trade unions with an approximate membership of 22,000.

Main Crops and Products

Gold mining is the only substantial non-agricultural industry and the Colony is otherwise wholly dependent upon primary production plus associated industries of the nature of coconut oil extraction and processing, pineapple canning and butter manufacture. Export income is secured from the sugar and the small pineapple canning industries, which depend almost wholly upon the Indian community, and from gold, copra and bananas, which are in turn all produced largely by Fijian labour and enterprise.

Production for local consumption only, which normally closely approaches local needs, includes rice, root crops, such as taro, yams and cassava; fish and livestock products including whole milk, butter and ghee, beef, pork, goat flesh and eggs; and miscellaneous fruits and pulses.
The livestock population is estimated at:
- horses 16,000; cattle 81,000; pigs 9,000;
- goats 24,000; poultry 150,000.

During 1953 approximately 583,000 cubic feet of sawn timber was produced and approximately 2,500,000 feet (stacked) of firewood. Shortage of staff has handicapped forestry development.

Reef and coastal fishing is undertaken in a small way by Fijians and Indians but the supply of local fish does not nearly meet the demand.

A geological survey is being undertaken to determine in detail the areas of possible economic mineralization. Upon completion a geological map of the Colony will be issued. The cost of the survey is being met from a grant of £45,882 from the United Kingdom.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are 47 co-operative societies, 39 of which are composed of Fijian members and 8 of Indians. The total membership is 2,903 and £30,610 has been subscribed out of an authorized capital of £140,000. All local purchasers of copra sell to the Copra Board, which exports all copra and copra products. Cane growers sell their cane to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. All bananas for export are purchased by licensed buyers, who are required to pay a minimum price in accordance with ruling export sale values. Three of these buyers are Fijian organizations.

PITCAIRN ISLANDS GROUP

The small, volcanic islands of Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno, of which only the first is inhabited, lie about 3,500 miles from Panama and 3,000 from Auckland. Regular sea communication with the outside world is limited to the brief calls of large passenger liners, which heave to for a few hours. A small radio station is of particular importance in arranging such calls with passing ships, especially when a doctor is required.

Pitcairn was discovered by Carteret in 1767. In 1790 the Bounty mutineers landed with some women from Otaheite and these were the forebears of the present inhabitants. It was annexed as a colony in 1838 when two British ships visited the island. The population was removed at its own request in 1856 but 40 soon returned, and today the Islanders number about 130.

Pitcairn is a British colony by settlement and was brought within the jurisdiction of the Western Pacific High Commission in 1898. On the 1st April, 1952, by Order in Council made by Her Majesty the Queen, the administration was assumed by the Governor of Fiji, following the separation of the offices of the Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.

There is an Island Council consisting of the Chief Magistrate, two assessors and a secretary. These officers are elected annually by the people. The principal source of revenue is the sale of stamps. A Government school is established under a trained teacher. Medical attention is given by a nurse resident on the island, assisted in cases of emergency by doctors from passing ships.

Chief Magistrate—John Christian.
