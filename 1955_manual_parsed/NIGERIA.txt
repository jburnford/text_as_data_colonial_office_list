FEDERATION OF NIGERIA

Area
Of the total area of 373,250 square miles, the Colony comprises 1,381 and the Protectorate 371,869 (including 34,081 in the Cameroons Trust Territory). The country is divided into three Regions whose areas are:—Northern 281,782, Eastern 46,065, Western 45,403 square miles.

Population
A census of the country was carried out in three stages: the Northern Region in July 1952, the Western Region in December 1952 and the Eastern Region in June 1953. The population, based on this census, amounted to 31,171,000 distributed as follows:—Northern Region 16,840,000; Eastern Region 7,971,000; Western Region 6,360,000. The total non-African population is approximately 15,000. The main tribal groups are:—Fulani 3,023,000, Hausa 5,488,000, Yoruba 4,508,000, Ibo 4,944,000. These are the known figures for each group within the Region it mainly inhabits and exclude minorities living in other Regions. Population is densest between Lagos and Ibadan in the West and around Kano in the North.

Geographical Features
There are four main zones, each stretching across the country from east to west and corresponding closely to the annual rainfall. This falls from as much as 200 inches in the south-east to as little as 20 inches in the north. The four zones are:

(i) A belt of creeks and mangrove swamps along the coast, which includes the Niger delta. It extends anything from 10 to 60 miles inland.

(ii) A well-watered belt of dense tropical forest from 50 to 100 miles wide. It is rich in oil palms and cacao.

(iii) A belt of park-like land with savannahs of high grass, and largely uninhabited because of tsetse fly.

(iv) A vast undulating plateau about 2,000 feet high, with occasional hills of granite and sandstone sometimes rising to over 5,000 feet. The northern half of this is free of tsetse fly, and carries a heavy stock of nomadic cattle. This area also produces groundnuts and cotton.

The Cameroons Mountain (13,350 ft.) is a volcano, and was last active in 1922. There are 2,600 square miles of land over 5,000 feet and 193,000 square miles over 1,000 feet. The main rivers (with length in Nigeria) are as follows: Niger, 730 miles; Benue, 495 miles; Sokoto, 390 miles; Kaduna, 340 miles; Cross, 335 miles and Dongola, 330 miles.

Lake Chad, the only important lake, has an area of 1,850 square miles. There are 119,431 square miles of forest (constituting 31·9% of the total area of the country) and 30,504 square miles of forest Reserve.

Climate
There is a dry season, roughly from November to April and a rainy season, which is longer in the south than the north and later in the east than the west. The wettest months in the north are August and September and in the south, June, July and August. Average annual rainfalls are:—Kaduna, 2,000 feet above sea level, 52 inches; Enugu, 600 feet above sea level, 71 inches; Ibadan, 600 feet above sea level, 48 inches. The annual average temperature is everywhere about 80°. In the south the temperature varies very little; in the north it may rise as high as 110° but the nights are cool.

Principal Towns
Lagos, with a population of 272,000, is the capital. The Regional capitals are Kaduna (Northern), Ibadan (Western), Enugu (Eastern) with populations of 51,635, 459,196 and 63,000 respectively. Nearly all the large towns are in the Western Region where there are at least ten towns of over 50,000 population. In the north, Kano has a population of 131,000. In the East, Onitsha, Aba and Enugu have more than 50,000.

History
As far back as the seventeenth century British traders had mercantile depots on the mouths of the Niger and adjacent rivers and creeks, trade until the nineteenth century being mainly in slaves. Journeys were not undertaken into the interior, however, until the era of exploration which began with the formation in London of an African Association in 1788. The Association directed its attention to solving the mystery of the “Great River” which was known to flow through much of West Africa. Thanks to the journeys of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, it was demonstrated in 1830 that the many rivers flowing into the Bight of Benin were, in fact, the delta of the Niger.

Under the inspiration of MacGregor Laird and others, efforts then began to use the Niger as a commercial highway into the interior. They were not on the whole successful, but British and other firms maintained stations in the delta chiefly to trade for palm oil. The energy and vision of Sir George Goldie led to an amalgamation of the British firms into a single company, and the new company developed its trade to such effect that opposing interests were all bought out. At the Berlin conference in 1885 the British claim to a sphere of influence over the Niger districts was accordingly recognized.

The British company, now given a charter and re-named the Royal Niger Company, proceeded to extend its influence into the interior by treaties with local rulers. There was friction with French interests but in 1898 the British and French Governments signed a convention regulating boundaries. In 1900 the administrative rights and powers of the Royal Niger Company were taken over by the Crown.
Until 1914 the country was administered in two parts—the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. The Colony comprised a small area around Lagos which had been annexed in 1862 as a base for operations against the slave trade. From 1900 to 1903 the authorities in Northern Nigeria were engaged in bringing under control the powerful emirates of the Hausa states and the Kanuri kingdom of Bornu which maintained large standing armies used for slave raiding.

In 1914 Northern and Southern Nigeria were amalgamated to form a Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. At the end of the 1914–18 war part of the adjacent territory of the German Cameroons (which had been occupied by Anglo-French forces) was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as part of Nigeria. Following the formation of the United Nations the Cameroons became a Trusteeship Territory.

**Constitution**

On the 1st of October, 1954, Nigeria became a Federation, its government being provided for by the Nigeria (Constitution) Order in Council, 1954.

This Order provides for a Council of Ministers comprising the Governor-General as President and ten Ministers (three from each Region and one from the Southern Cameroons) and three *ex officio* Members, namely the Chief Secretary of the Federation, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Financial Secretary of the Federation.

There is a House of Representatives for the Federation, consisting of the Speaker and 184 elected members, 92 elected by the Northern Region, 42 elected by the Western Region, 42 elected by the Eastern Region, six elected by the Southern Cameroons and two by Lagos. There may be special Members, not exceeding six, appointed by the Governor-General to represent communities and interests not otherwise adequately represented and in addition, the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary of the Federation are *ex officio* members of the House of Representatives.

Elections to the House of Representatives were completed in December 1954. The strength of the main parties in the new House is:

- **Northern Peoples’ Congress (N.P.C.)** 79 seats
- **National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (N.C.N.C.)** 56 seats
- **Action Group/United National Independence Party alliance** 27 seats
- **Kamerun National Congress (K.N.C.)** 6 seats
- **Others** 16 seats

The N.C.N.C. won a majority of seats in the Eastern and Western Regions and so has six Ministers in the Council of Ministers; the N.P.C. won a majority of seats in the Northern Region and has three Ministers; and the remaining central Minister belongs to the K.N.C. which won all the seats in the Southern Cameroons.

Each Region has its own Executive Council under the Regional Governor. In the Northern Region, in addition to the Ministers, there are three *ex officio* Members in the Council.

In the Northern and Western Regions there are two-chamber systems of Government, consisting in each case of a House of Chiefs and a House of Assembly. In the Eastern Region there is a House of Assembly only. The Members of the Eastern and Western Houses of Assembly are all elected. In the Northern Region the Members of the House of Assembly are all elected except for four *ex officio* Members and five Special Members who are appointed by the Governor of the Region.

The Southern Cameroons has an Executive Council, comprising the Commissioner of the Cameroons as President, three *ex officio* Members, and four unofficial Members whom the Governor-General appoints from among the members of the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons.

The N.P.C. is the majority party in the Northern House of Assembly, the N.C.N.C. in the Eastern House of Assembly, the Action Group in the Western House of Assembly, and the K.N.C. in the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons.

Elections to the Federal House of Representatives are completely separate from the elections to the Regional and Southern Cameroons Houses of Assembly. The method of election to the Federal Legislature varies with the Regions. In the Northern Region and the Southern Cameroons the basic principle of election is through electoral colleges. In the Western Region the Federal elections in 1954 were based on elections by ballot for all tax-payers, with no age qualification. In the Eastern Region universal adult suffrage was introduced for Federal elections. In the Western and Eastern Regions and in Lagos voting was by secret ballot with the use of symbols. Elections to the Regional Houses of Assembly follow the same pattern, although they are subject to such variation as circumstances require.

Under the 1954 Constitution certain subjects became exclusively a matter for the Federal Legislature. In addition there is a Concurrent List of Subjects which may be dealt with by the Regional Legislatures as well as by the Federal Legislature. All other subjects became a matter for the Regions. Among the subjects which became exclusively Federal are External Affairs, Aviation, Banks, Census, Customs, Defence, Police, Maritime Shipping, Mines and Minerals, Posts and Telegraphs, Trunk Roads and Railways.

**Land Policy**

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives. There is a small amount of Crown land acquired mainly for public purposes.

**Taxation**

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and general tax. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for non-natives throughout Nigeria, and natives in the township of Lagos, to pay a graduated income tax ranging from 4½d. in every £ of the first £200 to 15s. in the £ for every £ exceeding £10,000. There are special rates for incomes which do not exceed £150. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. In 1948 an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom Government for the avoidance of double taxation.

General tax is paid by natives outside the township of Lagos, assessed in a variety of ways from the individual assessment of wealthy traders in large towns to a flat rate in backward areas.
The other two main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duties.

| Loan from Cocoa Marketing Board | 2,510,542 |

Total: £23,748,542

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s. and 10s.; alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d.; bronze coins of 1d., ½d. and tenth penny. Nickel coins of 1d., ½d. and tenth penny continue to circulate but are withdrawn on presentation to banks. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development Plans**

Nigeria received an allocation of £23,000,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. In 1951 the plan was revised and it is now proposed to spend about £34 million between 1951 and 1956. The money is to be found from the following sources:

| Source                  | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Colonial Development and Welfare Grant | 16,212,584 |
| Nigeria Revenue         | 8,020,557  |
| Loan funds              | 9,950,450  |

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- **Basic Services**: £15,537,931 (45·4%)
- **Social Services**: £10,338,082 (30·3%)
- **Productive Services**: £8,307,638 (24·3%)

**Basic Services**.—14·09% of the total will be spent on buildings and 9·29% on roads.

**Social Services**.—13·08% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 8·63% on general education.

**Productive Services**.—8·96% of the total will be spent on agriculture.

In common with other Colonial Territories, Nigeria has prepared new plans for the years 1955–60, details of which are still under consideration.

**Other Development**

The Regional Production Development Boards are devoting large sums of money to the improvement of production methods for both food and export crops which is so essential to the well-being of the country. They include the operation of oil mills in the west and east, the distribution of artificial fertilizers, particularly in the north, a survey of cocoa soils, the establishment of a 20,000 acre cattle ranch in the east and schemes for mechanizing rice cultivation. They are also spending large sums on roads. The Government has also set up a Development Board at Lagos to provide roads and services near Apapa Wharf to which the Colonial Development Corporation is lending £1½ million. The most important industrial plants, other than the Nigerian Tobacco Company at Ibadan and the plywood and veneer factory at Sapele, are the spinning and weaving mills at Kano and Lagos and the ceramic factory at Ikorodu, near Lagos, which supplies a large proportion of domestic pottery requirements. Plant for the manufacture of cement is in process of establishment at Nkalago, in the Eastern Region.

**Education**

There is a University College at Ibadan with Faculties of Arts, Science, Agriculture and Medicine; funds have been voted for the erection of a Teaching Hospital, the University College Hospital, Ibadan. In 1953–54, 405 students were in residence in Ibadan and others were completing clinical and other courses in the United Kingdom. The Zaria branch of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology is to be the biggest of the three branches of this Institution which, when completed, will cater for 750 resident students at its three branches in Zaria, Ibadan and Enugu. Other technical education is available at the Yaba Technical Institute where there were 219 full time students, and at the Yaba, Kaduna, Enugu, Ombe River, Kano and Bukuru Trade Centres with an attendance of 709 trainees. Another Centre at Sapele will open during 1955. In 1953–54, in addition to 178 scholarship training course and study leave awards made by the Central Government, the Eastern and Western Regional Governments awarded 230 and 200 scholarships respectively, a large proportion of them being for study overseas. The Northern Regional Government also embarked on an extensive training programme of some 200 awards. The number of Nigerian students in the United Kingdom during 1953–54 was about 2,000. There were, in addition, 318 Nigerian students in the United States of America and 45 in Canada.

In 1953 there were 127 Secondary Schools with an estimated enrolment of 32,500 students; 116 Teacher Training Colleges and Centres with an enrolment of some 9,000 students, and 9,651 Primary Schools with an enrolment of 1,069,789 students.

The total estimated expenditure on education from public funds during the financial year 1953–54 was as follows:

| Source                  | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Government and Colonial Development and Welfare | 3,795,180 |
| Native Administration   | 611,360    |

Total: £4,406,540

**Libraries and Museums**

Lagos has a Municipal Library and other libraries are maintained by the British Council and the Public Relations Department. The latter has also organized a travelling library scheme.

A National Museum is under construction at Lagos and there are local museums at Jos, Ife, Oron and Benin.
Health

The principal diseases are malaria, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, cerebro-spinal meningitis, pneumonia, smallpox, leprosy, yaws, tuberculosis, dysentery, venereal diseases, intestinal parasites, filariasis, onchocerciasis, elephantiasis and tropical ulcers. Under 6,000 cases of sleeping sickness were treated in 1952-53 compared with 7,505 in 1951-52; 3,258 cases of smallpox and 2,275 of cerebro-spinal meningitis were treated. Intensive vaccination campaigns greatly reduced the number of smallpox cases. Considerable progress was made in the campaign against leprosy. There were over 50,000 patients under treatment.

Hospitals (excluding infectious diseases hospitals) numbered 129. There were 271 Maternity Centres and 9 Rural Health Centres. Beds available in hospitals totalled 9,879 and in Maternity Centres 2,430. For every 100,000 of the population there were 0·414 hospitals, 3·27 Dispensaries and 0·869 Maternity Centres. One hospital bed was available to about every 3,000 of the population. 1,361,473 out-patients and 158,163 in-patients were treated in the hospitals and over 10 million cases were dealt with by Dispensaries. In Maternity Centres 45,262 deliveries were made and over 700,000 attended for ante-natal treatment.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953-54 was estimated at £5,189,503 compared with £458,384 in 1938-39.

Communications

Kano, Lagos and Maiduguri are international airports and there are 15 other airfields used by the internal services of West African Airways Corporation. The Corporation also operates services connecting Lagos with the other British West African territories, Dakar and Khartoum. International services of B.O.A.C., K.L.M. and Air France connect Nigeria with London, Western Europe, the Union of South Africa and French West and Equatorial Africa. A connexion to New York is available by the Pan American Service through Accra. During 1953 11,508 aircraft arrived and departed. The number of air passengers exceeded 57,600. Full meteorological forecasting offices are established at Kano and Lagos under the control of the British West African Meteorological Service with headquarters in Lagos.

The Nigerian Railway carried 5,490,432 passengers in 1953-54 and 2,298,000 tons of freight. Route mileage totals 1,903 and track mileage 2,218, plus 133 miles of narrow gauge.

There are 28,807 miles of road (1953); bituminous surface 1,631 miles, gravel or earth surface 27,176 miles.

The main ports are Lagos and Port Harcourt, and there are smaller ports at Calabar, Burutu, Sapele, Warri, Victoria and Tiko. Services for passengers and cargo from the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines Limited, which operates a regular fortnightly passenger service, Palm Line Limited, John Holt Line Limited and Elders and Fyffes. Cargo services are also operated from Scandinavian ports by Hoegh Line and Scandinavian West Africa Line.

The Nigerian Government maintains a service carrying passengers and coal between Lagos and Port Harcourt while there is a regular monthly service linking Lagos, Calabar and Victoria provided by Elder Dempster Lines. This company and the Palm Line also provide irregular services linking other coastal ports while a Spanish concern links Calabar and Fernando Po.

The river Niger and its chief tributary, the river Benue, are the principal inland water highways. The Niger is navigable for a distance of 537 miles upstream to Jebba and the Benue for 547 miles from Lokoja to Garua in the French Cameroons. Although the Benue and the upper reaches of the Niger are only navigable during a limited season at high water, both rivers provide an important alternative to the Nigerian Railway for the evacuation of produce. In all there are approximately 4,000 miles of navigable inland waterways in Nigeria.

Broadcasting

The Government runs broadcasting stations at Lagos (one 20 kW. and two 0·3 kW.), Kaduna (one 7½ kW. and two 0·3 kW.), Enugu (one 2½ kW. and two 0·3 kW.) and Ibadan (one 0·3 kW.). There were 9,757 subscribers in 1953 with an estimated four listeners per receiver. The Government operates wired distribution systems in the Northern and Eastern Regions. In the Western Region the system is operated by a private company under licence. There were over 28,000 subscribers in 1953.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture and the largest number of wage earners is employed by the Government. In 1953, the total number of wage earners was about 300,000 of whom, 3,000 were females. This figure does not include the many persons working for small employers. The following are the 1953 figures for those occupations in which there are more than 19,000 employees.

Government service . . . . . . 64,027
Transport . . . . . . 42,723
Metal Mining . . . . . . 41,584
Agriculture and Livestock production 47,301
Construction . . . . . . 33,515
Wholesale and retail trades . . . . . . 23,496

In 1953 there were 131 Trade Unions with a membership of 143,282. Six unions had memberships in excess of 5,000 and aggregated 90,593. The largest union is the Nigerian Union of Teachers.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are yams, cassava, guinea corn and millet, cocoyams, groundnuts, oil palms, maize, cocoa, rice and cotton.

The livestock population is: goats 6,230,000, cattle 4,048,000, sheep 2,949,000, swine 90,000.

Timber products are of three categories: logs, sawn timber and plywood, of which the first is the most important. 11·9 million cubic feet of logs and 1·2 million cubic feet of sawn timber were exported in 1953.

Despite extensive fishing in inland and coastal waters, the supply of fish does not meet the demand. At sea, improved methods of fishing by canoe and motor boat are being developed. The Nigerian Shipping and Trading Company are operating two large trawlers. Inland reservoirs are being stocked and village fishing ponds started.

The chief minerals are tin, all of which is exported, and coal which is used almost entirely by the railway. Small quantities of columbite,
lead, zinc and gold are also produced. Tin concentrates production runs at about 12,000 tons a year and coal at about 700,000 tons.

Apart from hand methods of expressing ground nut and palm oil, there are 57 palm oil mills operated mainly by Regional Production Development Boards; five groundnut oil mills, three of which are privately owned; three soap factories at Apapa, Aba and Kano; a cigarette factory at Ibadan; a brewery at Lagos; several small plants producing fruit juices, minerals and soda water; a cannery; an up-to-date plywood and veneer factory at Sapele, several small sawmills elsewhere; two 50-loom weaving mills, one near Lagos, the other at Kano; some light engineering works; tyre re-treading plants; a ceramic factory; and several rice mills, some being Government-operated.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Four independent Regional Marketing Boards handle the five main export crops—cocoa, palm kernels and palm oil, groundnuts and cotton. They ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, spend money on research and finance schemes for the economic benefit of the people in the producing areas. The Government and the Marketing Boards have a common policy of developing co-operative organizations. Its success is indicated by the fact that the tonnage of cocoa marketed by the Association of Nigerian Co-operative Exporters represented over 10% of the total Nigerian cocoa crop. The Government also finances the Department of Co-operative Societies whose activities and scope have expanded steadily. At the end of 1953, there were 1,336 co-operative societies with a membership of 73,841. Their assets aggregated more than £650,000.
