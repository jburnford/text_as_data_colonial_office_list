**SIERRA LEONE**

**Area**

The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925; South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

**Population**

The mid-1952 estimate of population was 2,005,000 (Colony 130,000; Protectorate 1,875,000). Twenty-five per cent. of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these, and about 2,000 Europeans and Asiatics, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

**Geographical Features**

Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which reaches 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.
Climate

There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground. Most of the rain falls in the three months July–September. The mean temperature is approximately 80°, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately 10°, inland it is approximately 20° on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25-30% inland.

History

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government". This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

Constitution

That part of Sierra Leone administered as a Colony includes the Sierra Leone Peninsula, Tasso Island, Banana Island, and York Island, and the township of Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

Royal Instructions of 1951 provide for an Executive Council of four ex officio members and no less than four unofficial members appointed from among the elected members of the Legislative Council. An Order in Council of 1951 provides for a Legislative Council consisting of 32 members, including the Governor (who is President) and a Vice-President. There are seven ex-officio members, seven members elected from the Colony districts, twelve members elected from the Protectorate District Councils, two members elected from the Protectorate Assembly, and two nominated members appointed by the Governor. This Order in Council contains provisions in connexion with legislative procedure which previously were included in the Letters Patent. It does not, however, contain the procedure for the election of members to the Legislative Council. This is now provided for in a local Statute, the Legislative Council (Elections) Ordinance, 1951.

An amendment to the Royal Instructions made in April 1953 vests the six unofficial members of Executive Council with the title and responsibilities of Ministers.

With regard to the Protectorate, in 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation of Chiefdoms in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities were vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations and from grants made by Government and by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board.

Land Policy

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding 50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation

There are three forms of direct taxation in force: income tax, poll tax, and house tax. Income tax is chargeable on individuals at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man is granted £300, and a married man £500 as an initial relief. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £ and a double taxation agreement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government. Poll tax is payable by non-natives at the rate of £4 a year and is offset against an individual's liability for income tax. A house tax of 5s. a year is payable in the Protectorate by all adult native males.

The two main forms of indirect taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duties.
Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 886,149    | 910,077         |
| 1949 | 2,730,340  | 2,457,661       |

| 1953 | 5,418,133  | 5,269,095       |

In 1953, £2,832,671 of total revenue was derived from Customs and £2,002,887 from taxes. In the same year, the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: £950,352
- Public Works: £1,248,881
- Administration: £295,111
- Development Schemes: £598,204

The Public Debt at the end of December 1953 amounted to £5,128,841 (approximately £2 11s. 3d. per head of population) and comprises:

- Sierra Leone Government 4½% inscribed Stock 1955: £57,825
- Sierra Leone Government 4½% inscribed Stock 1955: £202,500
- Sierra Leone Government 4½% inscribed Stock 1955: £151,100

- 2nd Instalment Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968–70: £1,680,000

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ½d. In addition bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. are now in circulation. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946. The Plan provided for the development of the following three main services at a total cost of £5,256,575 in the ten-year period:

- Communications: £1,155,500
- Development of Natural Resources: £1,015,000
- Social and Basic Services: £3,086,075

As a contribution towards this expenditure, an allocation of £2,600,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 was made.

Owing to difficulties in obtaining the requisite supervisory staff and materials it was not possible to work strictly to the outline plan referred to above, and a comprehensive review of the economic potentialities of the country was therefore undertaken in 1949 and "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was produced and published. The purpose was to indicate the measures necessary to achieve a substantial increase in economic production in the next five years. The Plan envisaged the expenditure of £5,000,000 to be raised by loans, as and when required, to finance the following projects:

- Deep Water Quay: £1,350,000
- Railway: £1,250,000
- Roads and Bridges: £800,000
- Inland Waterways: £20,000
- Civil Airport at Lungi: £165,000
- Freetown Electricity Supplies: £550,000
- Guma Valley Hydro-electric Scheme: £500,000
- Water and Electricity Supplies in the Protectorate: £300,000

Total: £4,935,000

Other Development

Under the provisions of the Development of Industries (Assistance) Ordinance, 1946, the Government has established the Development of Industries Board. This Board may grant loans, either with or without interest or security, from monies voted for the purpose by Legislative Council, which may not in aggregate exceed £10,000 in any one year, to assist in the establishment of new, or the development of existing industries which, in the view of the Board, will contribute to the economic development of Sierra Leone. Since the inception of the Board loans totalling £26,900 have been granted for the establishment or extension of certain industries including the manufacture of soap, mineral water, furniture and boot and shoe making, weaving and spinning, fishing, rice-milling and nut-cracking, timber-sawing, motor repairing and market gardening.

Education

University courses in Divinity, Arts, Commerce and Education are provided at Fourah Bay College (University of Durham), Freetown. At the beginning of 1953–54 session, 149 students were in attendance at these courses. Seventy scholarships for higher education were awarded in 1953 (30 for study overseas, 12 for degree courses at Fourah Bay College, and 28 for Higher School Certificate and General Certificate of Education courses at Fourah Bay College, Prince of Wales School and Bo Government School). Seventy-two Sierra Leone scholarship students and about 196 private students were known to be studying in the United Kingdom. About 45 private students were known to be studying in the U.S.A.

There are five Teacher Training Colleges and two Teacher Training Departments in the territory; 415 students, including 24 agricultural instructors, were in training in 1953.

There are two Government Secondary Grammar Schools, three Government Secondary Central Schools and nine assisted Secondary Schools in the territory; 3,703 students were enrolled in 1953. There are also two unassisted Secondary Schools, which had 306 pupils. Four Government, 257 assisted and 96 unassisted Primary Schools had an enrolment of 46,833 pupils.

Literacy campaigns were conducted by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in chiefdoms and 1,450 reading certificates were issued. It is claimed that between 25,000 and 30,000 people
have become literate in the vernacular, and 35,000 books in Mende, Kono, Temne and Kuranko were sold or distributed in 1953.

The Extramural Department of Fourah Bay College, the British Council and the Social Welfare Department organized adult education courses in various subjects.

Expenditure from all sources on education was approximately £622,504 in 1953 of which £218,231 was contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £38,518.

Libraries

There are libraries in schools and Government departments. Fourah Bay College has a library of some 7,500 volumes. The British Council maintains a subscription library of over 18,000 books and makes regular bulk loans of books and periodicals to the Protectorate. In Freetown there are also two small public libraries.

Health

In 1953 beds available in hospitals (including two Infirmarys and a maternity hospital) totalled 1,124 (Government 873, Missions 172, Mining 79). In-patients at Government Hospitals numbered 10,744 and out-patients 127,830. There were 29 Government dispensaries (excluding 21 treatment centres attached to the Endemic Diseases Control Unit) at which 139,414 new cases were handled. Special measures to control malaria and endemic diseases are undertaken by Government.

Actual expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953 was £394,644 from Colony resources and £22,598 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. By comparison actual expenditure in 1935 was £63,923.

Communications

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the only international airport in the territory and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Air Services are operated through Freetown Airport by Air France, Hunting-Clan/Airwork Services and West African Airways Corporation. They connect Sierra Leone to the three other British West African Colonies and provide a thrice-weekly service to and from the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe. Meteorological services are available and are a part of the British West African Meteorological Service with headquarters at Lagos.

The railway carried 1,037,980 passengers and 126,759 tons of freight in 1953. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 337. This mileage included a branch line covering a distance of 82½ miles. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 57½ miles.

There are 2,663 miles of road (1953)—bituminous surface 110 miles, gravel or earth surface, 2,553 miles.

Freetown is a port of British Shipping Registry, four miles up the Sierra Leone River and has one of the finest harbours in Africa. Smaller ports are at Pepel, Bonthe and Sulima. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines. Bonthe and Sulima are loading ports for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piassava. Passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and Palm Line, Limited, and to the Continent by Holland West Africa Line. A limited cargo service to the east coast ports of America is provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and the Barber Steamship Lines, and to South Africa by J. P. Holmen, Limited, and Elder Dempster Lines, Limited.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and Bonthe River to the south.

Broadcasting

Government operates a wired broadcasting system in Freetown which rediffuses the B.B.C. Overseas Service and local programmes to which there were 3,500 subscribers in August 1954. In the same month the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 818. The operation and maintenance of the station is in charge of the Posts and Telegraphs Department while the rediffusion programmes are arranged by the Public Relations Department.

There is no direct broadcasting at present but it is expected that a 5 kW transmitter will be brought into operation in April, 1955.

Principal Occupations

It is estimated that over half the population are engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups as follows:—Building and construction 10,205; mining 6,195; transport (road, rail and air) 4,219; maritime and waterfront 4,529; Army and Navy services 1,309; commercial and miscellaneous 6,779; Government and Native Administration (excluding workers in other groups) 11,539. Smaller employers provide employment for an estimated additional 30,000 workers of whom a large proportion are domestic servants. The total number of workers in wage-earning employment is therefore approximately 80,000.

There were at the beginning of 1954, 11 registered workers’ unions with a total membership of 19,862.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piassava, rice, cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, cassava, bennised, Kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: cattle 150,000, goats 25,000, sheep 10,000, pigs 4,000.

The main timber products in 1953 (figures in solid cubic feet) were:—sawn timber 365,000; shingles 4,000; roundwood 3,000,000; firewood 90,015,000; charcoal 14,000 and gum copal to the value of £600. Furniture to the value of £18,502 was made by the Government Forest Industries Branch. Sawn timber is not available for export but small quantities of gum copal and charcoal are exported.

Inshore fishing by African fishermen is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown and the Protectorate. One British and one Italian trawler have recently begun operations from Freetown.
The Headquarters of the West African Fisheries Research Institute are situated at Kissy, near Freetown. Their research trawler has been operating from Takoradi in the Gold Coast during the months April-July 1954, and their launches have maintained an intensive inshore research programme throughout the year. The Institute also possesses two seine boats, which are undertaking an intensive fishing and hydrological survey of the Sierra Leone River estuary.

The chief minerals mined are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Small quantities of gold are also found. Production in 1953 was:

- Iron ore . . . . . . 1,367,986 tons
- Diamond . . . . . . 481,692 carats
- Chromite . . . . . . 24,334 tons
- Gold . . . . . . . . 1,645 ozs.

Other minerals known to occur in Sierra Leone are platinum, ilmenorutile, lignite, cassiterite and molybdenite.

Eight pioneer oil mills for the expressing of palm oil are operated by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board. An oil-expressing plant for the production of groundnut and kernel oil is expected to be in operation in 1955. It will be operated by Government. A hammermill will be incorporated in the plant to produce pig feed. Government operates one small and two large rice mills and there are a few privately owned mills, all on a small scale. Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise. Two privately owned soap factories produce approximately 125 tons of soap per year. Village industries include weaving, hand methods of expressing palm oil, and cracking of palm nuts to obtain the kernel. Mechanical coffee-hulling is also being introduced and experiments are being made with the mechanical preparation of foofoo. A mobile, power-driven, palm nut cracking machine has been developed and tested and is being gradually introduced in the country. Increasing assistance continued to be given to the banana industry throughout the year.

The chief imports are cotton and artificial silk piece-goods, apparel of all kinds, machinery, iron and steel manufactures, and beverages.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up under Ordinance No. 1 of 1949, the objects being to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchase, marketing and export of Sierra Leone produce, and to assist, by all possible means, in the development of the agricultural industry in Sierra Leone and of secondary industries connected with it. To this end the Board has erected six pioneer mills for the extraction and processing of palm oil and two are in course of erection.

On 30th April, 1954, there were 135 Co-operative Societies, with 5,643 members and subscribed capital of £4,454. Their surplus and reserves totalled £6,328. Their turnover during the year ending on that date was £89,000. Government has authorized the advance of up to £20,000 in loans to co-operative societies, mostly to assist them in giving short-term loans to their members.
