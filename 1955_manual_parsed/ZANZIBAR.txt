ZANZIBAR

Area

Zanzibar Island is 640 square miles in area, and Pemba 380 square miles.

Population

The population was 264,162 at the 1948 census. (Zanzibar Island 149,575 and Pemba 114,587; racial composition: Europeans 296; Arabs 44,560; Indians, including Pakistanis and Goans, 15,892; Africans 199,860; others 3,554.) The latest estimate is 278,000.

Geographical Features

The island of Zanzibar is the largest coralline island on the East African coast and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. To the north-east at a distance of some 25 miles lies the island of Pemba. Both islands are low-lying, the highest land being little over 390 feet (Masingini Ridge).

Climate

The mean maximum temperature is 84·4° and the mean minimum 76·6° (Zanzibar Town). The warmest season is from January to March (average 82° to 86°) and the coolest, June to September (average 75° to 78°). The average annual rainfall in Pemba varies from 65 inches in the north to 92 inches in the south; in Zanzibar from 49 inches to over 72 inches, the maximum being recorded in the centre of the Island. There is no real dry season but the rainy seasons are well marked, being March to May in the south-west monsoon and in November and December at the start of the north-east monsoon.

History

In 1698 the Arabs of Oman captured Mombasa, where the Portuguese had built a fort in 1592. Thereafter the whole of the East African coast as far south as Cape Delgado, including Zanzibar and Pemba, passed from Portuguese into Arab hands. Seyyid Said bin Sultan, the founder of modern Zanzibar and of its clove industry, was elected to the Imamate in 1804 and transferred his capital from Muscat to
Zanzibar in 1832, and during his reign Zanzibar became both politically and commercially the principal town in East Africa. In 1861, by an award of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India, the Imam's possessions in Africa became independent of Muscat and from that date Oman and Zanzibar have remained politically separate.

By an agreement in 1886 Great Britain and Germany recognized the Sultanate of Zanzibar over the islands of the coast (including Zanzibar and Pemba) and a ten-mile wide strip on the mainland.

In 1887 the Sultan handed over the administration of many of his possessions on the African Continent to the British East Africa Association (later, the Imperial British East Africa Company). The Government of these territories eventually passed to the British Government when they became known as the British East Africa Protectorate (later, Kenya Colony and Protectorate) and the Uganda Protectorate. Zanzibar still receives the sum of £10,000 a year from Kenya for the rights which the latter exercises in the coastal strip.

In June 1889 Zanzibar and Pemba were placed under British protection by the Sultan, Seyyid Ali bin Said. The Protectorate was proclaimed in 1890 and the following year a regular form of Government was set up.

The present Sultan acceded in 1911. In 1914 the control of the Sultanate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, the offices of His Majesty's Agent and Consul-General and His Highness' First Minister being merged in that of the newly created post of British Resident who was appointed subject to the control of the Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate as High Commissioner. At the same date a Protectorate Council was constituted as an advisory body with His Highness as President and the British Resident as Vice-President.

In 1925 the office of High Commissioner was abolished and the British Resident was made directly responsible to the Colonial Office. Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted in 1926 in place of the old advisory Protectorate Council.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered by a British Resident who exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1924. The Executive Council is presided over by the Sultan with the British Resident as Vice-President and consists of the Heir Apparent to the Throne, four *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Senior Commissioner and the Financial Secretary) and three official members. The Legislative Council is presided over by the British Resident and comprises four *ex officio*, five official, and eight unofficial members. The unofficial members include three Arabs, two Africans, two Indians and one European.

**Land Policy**

Under the Land Alienation Decree of 1939, subject to certain provisos, permanent alienation of land, leases exceeding two years, and mortgages, by Arabs or Africans have no effect without the consent of a Land Alienation Board. In certain of the more undeveloped areas of the island, mainly inhabited by the indigenous Africans, the land is communally held and, according to native custom, cannot be alienated. But throughout the plantation areas (west and centre of both islands) land is freehold and there is no other statutory qualification as to its disposal. A good deal of land is, however, reserved under the system of quasi-religious dedication of Muslim law, known as *Wakf*.

**Taxation**

The principal sources of taxation are Customs import duty, clove duty and income tax. There is no poll or hut tax.

The Income Tax Decree provides for taxation on incomes of over £200 but exempts income from agricultural sources. The rate of taxation is Shs. 1/50 in the £.

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 465,382    | 463,602         |
| 1949 | 1,118,337  | 1,209,012       |
| 1950 | 1,703,169  | 1,242,299       |
| 1951 | 1,801,824  | 1,387,181       |
| 1952 | 1,643,752  | 1,663,653       |
| 1953 | 2,783,235  | 1,789,025       |

Public Debt: a loan from the National Bank of India Finance and Development Corporation Limited for the new Zanzibar Electricity Scheme. The authorized total of the loan is £250,000, of which £150,000 was drawn up to 31st December, 1953.

The main heads of expenditure in 1953 were: agriculture £115,729, health £178,956, education £205,490, provincial administration £73,760, public works £370,834, pensions £108,174, police £81,973, port and marine £174,241.

The chief sources of revenue in 1953 were: import duty £740,091, clove duty £1,172,153, licences, etc., £151,887, Fees of Court, etc., £195,783, Colonial Development and Welfare grants £88,502, and copra, coconut oil and soap duty £116,290.

**Currency**

The standard coin of the Protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Shs. 20 = £1) with the following subsidiary coinage:—50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent (bronze). East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon.

**Development Plans**

Zanzibar has received grants to a total of £1,319,184 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. These grants have been made in connexion with the Ten-Year Development Programme. The programme was revised in 1951 and since that time practically all the permanent recurrent expenditure has been taken into the Protectorate Estimates. To offset this, revenue from "development duties" (which until 1951 accrued to the Development Authority) is now paid direct to Protectorate revenue while an annual subvention is made from Protectorate Funds to meet expenditure by the Protectorate in connexion with the Development Programme.
Three new grants were received from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund in 1954, £37,000 for Education buildings, £22,800 for Research into the control of insect pests on coconut palms and £7,250 for extensions to the Broadcasting service. It is anticipated that by the end of March 1956, expenditure on development schemes will have been in the following proportions:

| C.D. and W. Protectorate | Total |
|--------------------------|-------|
| Economic (Agriculture)   | £405,212 |
| Social Services (Education and Health) | £525,414 |
| General (including Town Improvement and Aerodrome) | £388,558 |
| **Total**                | £1,319,184 |

The total expenditure of the Health Department in 1953 was £147,372 compared with £35,577 in 1935.

**Communications**

Zanzibar airport is situated some four or five miles from the town. It has one all-weather runway. Operations are restricted to aircraft with a maximum all-up weight of 44,000 lb. This figure is ample for the types of aircraft in use at present, but the construction of the runway and the adjacent terrain is such that extensions could easily be made. A new airport building came into use in 1952. Air Traffic Control and other services are provided. The airport is open during daylight hours. The total number of aircraft movements during 1953 was 3,386. The number of passengers handled was 35,000 of which 10,000 were in transit. Pemba Airport is situated approximately six miles from Chake Chake. There is an all-weather runway with a landing restriction of 33,000 lb. Only temporary terminal facilities exist at present.

Zanzibar has 210 miles of roads, of which 150 miles are bitumen surfaced; Pemba has 110 miles, of which 50 are bitumen surfaced. There are no railways.

Ocean-going vessels maintain regular and frequent communication with all parts of the world; 289 called at the port of Zanzibar during 1953, representing a total net registered tonnage of 1,373,691. Government steamers maintain regular weekly connexions with Pemba and Dar es Salaam. Coasting vessels, carrying both passengers and cargo, also maintain regular services between Zanzibar, Kenya and Tanganyika ports. During 1953 the number of coasting vessels entered was 372 with a net registered tonnage of 183,760; the number of native vessels entered was 3,725, with an aggregate tonnage of 130,335.

**Broadcasting**

The Government broadcasting service provides an hour's programme in Kiswahili six days a week, on a wavelength of 62·5 metres. The power of the transmitter is 0·25 kW. The station is the property of and operated by Cable and Wireless Limited under an agreement with Government. It is estimated that there are 2,500 receiving sets, most of them in Zanzibar Town. There is no licence fee.

**Principal Occupations**

A large proportion of the rural population is engaged in food production; paid labour is largely dependent on the Protectorate's two major industries, cloves and coconuts, and the processing and handling of their products. Agricultural labourers employed by Government number about 1,200. Fishing is also the occupation of a large number but they usually cultivate as well.

In urban areas, the principal occupations are transport, building, port and dock labour, domestic service, employment in sanitation and public works, clerical work, and business.

There are five employees' trade unions (membership over 500) and one employers' union (membership 10).

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are cloves, coconuts, rice, cassava, sweet potatoes, citrus fruits, chillies, tobacco, maize and millet.
The number of cattle in Pemba is approximately 23,307 and in Zanzibar 9,666. The export of hides and skins is a useful item in the Protectorate's economy.

There are three small forests, one in Zanzibar and two in Pemba which yield a small amount of Mfuu (Vitex cuneata) and Mtondo (Calophyllum inophyllum), while jackwood (Artocarpus integra) is a useful timber of the clove areas.

Fishing is an important activity and although most of the fish is consumed locally, small quantities of both fresh and dried fish are exported. Since the beginning of 1953 the Fisheries Vessel has been regularly at sea surveying the fishing-grounds and testing gear and equipment.

The only industries are the distillation of clove-oil, coconut-oil expression and the manufacture of soap. The manufacture of coir fibre and rope by hand is fairly extensive in the coastal areas, but most of the resulting product is at present sold locally. A factory to process by-products of the coconut palm has recently commenced operating.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Clove Growers' Association, established in 1927 and incorporated by Decree in 1934, assists in stabilizing the price of cloves and distils and markets clove oil. The Association also assists in the marketing of other products, for example, tobacco, chillies, derris root and cacao. It also provides many valuable services to agriculturists.

There are 15 registered Co-operative Societies and more are in process of formation.
