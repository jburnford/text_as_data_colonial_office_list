THE LEEWARD ISLANDS

Area and Geographical Features.

The Colony has a total area of 423 square miles, and consists of a number of islands belonging partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. Anguilla, Sombrero and the British Virgin Islands lie apart, to the north and north-west. St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat and Redonda form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, and Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Antigua is the seat of government and residence of the Governor.

Population

The total population of the Colony at the 1946 census and the estimates at 31st December, 1953, are shown in the following table:

|                | Census 1946 | Estimate 1953 |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Antigua        | 41,757      | 49,692        |
| St. Kitts-Nevis| 46,243      | 52,057        |
| Montserrat     | 14,333      | 13,685        |
| Virgin Islands | 6,505       | 7,450         |
| **Total**      | **108,838** | **122,884**   |

Climate

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average annual rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to January.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493 and became British during the seventeenth century. They have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonized from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a humane slave amelioration Act.

Constitution

By the Leeward Islands Act, 1871, an Executive Council and a legislative body styled the General Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the five (now four—Dominica became a colony of the Windward Islands on 1st January, 1940) Presidencies which comprise the Colony. There is a majority of elected (now called representative) members on the General Legislative Council, there being five representative members each from the Presidential Legislatures of Antigua and St. Kitts–Nevis–Anguilla, two representative members from the Presidential Legislature of Montserrat and one representative member from the Presidential Legislature of the Virgin Islands, a total of 13 members. The representative members on the General Legislative Council are chosen by the unofficial members of the Presidential Legislatures from amongst the elected members of those Legislatures. Presidential members are also associated with the administration of their Presidencies by their appointment to Committees, dealing with such subjects as social services, public works and trade and production, under the chairmanship of elected members. The official members of the General Legislative Council are the Colonial Secretary, the Administrators of Antigua and St. Kitts–Nevis–Anguilla, the Attorney-General, the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and two persons holding office of emolument under the Government of the Colony or of any Presidency appointed by the Governor, a total of eight members. There are also two nominated members, appointed by the Governor from amongst the nominated members of the Presidential Legislatures. The Governor is President of the Council and has a casting, but not an original, vote. There is also a Deputy President of the Council chosen from amongst its members.
The Federal Executive Council comprises four *ex officio* members and ten appointed members, of whom three are official and seven unofficial.

The General Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the General Legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council, the life of which cannot exceed three years, meets at least once a year, at a place notified by Proclamation. There are usually two sessions a year lasting several days on each occasion.

The expenses of the federal establishment are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

As already announced, it is proposed, however, to abolish as soon as practicable the present Federal Government. The four Presidencies of the Leeward Islands will then become separate Colonies, the whole group remaining under one Governor. It has further been agreed in principle that ministerial systems should be introduced in Antigua and St. Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla, on the lines of the constitutions already in force in Barbados, Trinidad and Jamaica. The necessary preparations may take some time.

**Currency**

The British Caribbean Currency Board controls a unified decimal system of currency for the Eastern Group of the British Caribbean Territories, but only notes of denominations of $1 and upwards are at present in circulation. Trinidad and Tobago notes are being withdrawn. Silver and bronze coins of the United Kingdom are still in common use and are accepted at face value. United States currency circulates freely in the Virgin Islands, where all values and prices are determined by it.

**ANTIGUA**

**Area**

The area of Antigua is 108 square miles, the Dependency of Barbuda 62 square miles, the Dependency of Redonda (uninhabited) half a square mile. Barbuda lies 25 miles to the North, Redonda 25 miles to the south-west of the main island.

**Geographical Features**

The western part of the island of Antigua is composed entirely of volcanic rocks (highest point Boggy Peak, 1,330 feet). The eastern and northern parts are of limestone, below 500 feet above sea level, and a central plain stretches diagonally across the island. Barbuda is very flat with a large lagoon on the west side. There are no rivers.

**Principal Town**

St. John's, the capital, has a population of about 11,000.

**History**

The first settlers were a few English who arrived in 1632. In 1663 Charles II made a formal grant to Lord Willoughby, who at once proceeded
to send out large numbers of colonists. For a short time the island was in French occupation, but in 1667 it was declared an English possession in terms of the Treaty of Breda and has remained British from that date.

**Constitution**

The Executive Council consists of the Administrator and the Crown Attorney as *ex officio* members, and five other members appointed by the Governor. The Governor, and in his absence, the Administrator, presides over the Executive Council.

The Legislative Council, as reconstituted in December 1951, is composed of the Administrator as President, two official members, three nominated and eight elected members. A Deputy President is elected by the unofficial members of the Council from among their number.

**Land Policy**

Land may not be alienated or leased to aliens without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, alien occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. There is a small amount of Crown land which, when not used for public purposes, may be leased or sold.

**Taxation**

The main forms of taxation are income tax, trade tariffs and excise duties. The rates of individual income tax range from 6d. to 15s. 0d. per £ of chargeable income. Company tax is 6s. 8d. per £ of chargeable income.

Provision has been made for double taxation relief with the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand and consideration is being given to extending the arrangements to other countries.

(a) Estimate.

**Development Plans**

Antigua was originally allocated £499,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. A further grant of £200,000 was made in 1952, bringing the total allocation to £699,000. The actual expenditure under various schemes, in progress and completed, up to August 1954 was £665,323 made up as follows:

- Public Works: £190,972
- Social Services: £85,295
- Productive Services: £298,489
- Housing: £90,567

This has left a balance of £33,677 to which should be added £10,000 transferred from the Federal allocation making a total of £43,677 available for new schemes.

**Education**

There are 30 Government elementary schools, one grant-aided and six recognized private schools, with a total enrolment of 10,574 pupils. The five Secondary schools—four grant-aided and one denominational—have a total enrolment of 1,248 pupils. A Teachers’ Training College accommodates 40 female teachers from the four Presidencies of the Colony. The graduation standard from this college approximates to that of the Cambridge Higher School Certificate. There are 20 students studying in the United Kingdom, 14 in the United States and seven at the University College of the West Indies in Jamaica. Government expenditure on education in 1953 was $324,843 compared with $21,650 in 1935.

**Libraries**

The Public Library in St. John’s has a book stock of over 11,000 volumes. Library services have recently been established in the rural areas.

**Health**

The total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1954 was estimated at $543,535 compared with $86,318 in 1935. In 1952 the Hospital (96 beds) treated 2,022 cases. Apart from the dispensaries maintained at the residences of District Medical Officers, there are three health centres and 11 dispensaries.

**Communications**

Coolidge Airfield, which was constructed by the American Army Air Force as a military airfield in 1942, is now used by the local Government as a civil airfield. It is used mainly by Pan American Airways, British West Indian Airways and Air France with direct services to other West Indian Islands and to the United States of America. Travel to other parts of the world is made by connexions from Trinidad, Jamaica, and America.

There are 62 miles of main roads and 85 miles of secondary roads.

**Principal Occupations**

In 1950 the estimated number of persons employed was 14,400, 51% of them in agriculture and fishing.

The Main Products are sugar and cotton.

MONTserrat

Area and Geographical Features

The area of the island is about 32 square miles. It is very mountainous and comprises three main hill masses—Silver Hill in the north (1,285 feet), Central Hills (2,450 feet) and Soufriere Hills (Chance Peak 3,002 feet) in the south. The area of land under forest and woodland is about 10 square miles.

Principal Town

Plymouth, the only town, has a population of about 2,500.

History

The island was colonized in 1632 when a number of Irishmen of Warner's company made their homes there. It was captured by the French in 1667, restored to England at the Peace of Breda later in the same year, but capitulated to the French again in 1782, and was finally ceded to Britain in 1783.

Constitution

The present constitution is defined by Ordinance No. 1 of 1952 which enlarges the elective element in the Legislative Council and creates four electoral districts in place of a single one. The Council is now composed of the Commissioner as President, two ex officio members, two nominated members and five elected members. One of the elected members is also Deputy President of the Council. The Executive Council comprises the Commissioner (President), the Crown Attorney, the Treasurer and three unofficials appointed by the Governor.

Land Policy

Crown land comprises the Government Land Settlement, where occupation is confined to an annual lease, and a small area acquired for public purposes. All other land is privately owned.

Taxation

The following forms of direct taxation are in force:

Income Tax (ranging from 6d.—13s. 6d. per £ of chargeable income; companies 5s. 6d. per £ of chargeable income).
Land and House Tax.

* Revised estimate.
† Estimate.

It was estimated that in 1953, 44·4% of ordinary revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 8·3% from direct taxes.

Development Plans

Montserrat received an allocation of £124,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. This plan was revised at the end of 1951 and several useful projects are in process of execution. Further grants from the Imperial Treasury now bring the total allocation to £188,000.

Other Development.

A private company, the Montserrat Company Limited, is working side by side with Government in the development of a livestock industry. The establishment of an electric light and power plant for Plymouth is also projected by Government.

Education

Primary education and secondary education are both in the main government controlled. There are 12 Government elementary schools, one aided denominational school, and one elementary private school. There is one Government Secondary school, and a preparatory private
school for children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. At the end of 1953, of an estimated school population of 3,900, 3,296 children were enrolled in Primary schools, with an average attendance of 2,865 (86.9%). The enrolment of the Secondary school at the end of the same period was 144.

During the year 1953 there were three students from the Presidency pursuing professional courses abroad under the Leeward Islands Scholarship award, two of them in the United Kingdom, and one in Jamaica. One young woman completed in Great Britain an Arts Course under the Colonial £1,000,000 Scholarship Scheme. Three primary school teachers were in training colleges.

Government expenditure on education in 1953 was $125,188 compared with $14,000 in 1935.

Library

The Montserrat Public Library has a membership of over 550 adults and juveniles and comprises adult, juvenile and reference sections with a total book stock of about 4,000 volumes.

Health

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953 was $107,281, compared with $15,816 in 1935. There were 55 available beds at the Glendon Hospital. In-patients at the hospital totalled 1,110, out-patients (first attendances) 6,539. There were three health centres and four out-posts at which ante-natal and infant welfare clinics were held.

Communications

The island's road system consists of three main public roads, total mileage 33 miles; and about 30 miles of secondary unsurfaced roads. There is an air strip, and a regular weekly shuttle air service is operated between Montserrat and Antigua.

The Alcoa and the Harrison Steamship Companies' steamers call when freight offers. The island is linked with other islands of the Colony, and with Dominica and Barbados, by two motor launches which maintain a regular service between all the islands.

Broadcasting

A local broadcasting service has recently been approved under a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, and the Administration provides a grant of £100 per annum to meet local recurrent expenses.

Principal Occupations

In 1946, the total population gainfully employed was found to be 6,617, 59.68% of them in agriculture. There is one trade union in the island which claimed a membership of 368 at the end of 1953.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, limes, sugar cane and sweet potatoes.

ST. CHRISTOPHER, NEVIS and ANGUILLA

Area and Geographical Features

The total area of the Presidency is 153 square miles (St. Kitts 68, Nevis 50 and Anguilla 35 square miles). St. Kitts has a range of lofty mountains traversing its central part (Mount Misery 3,711 feet). Nevis is nearly circular in form with a central mountain rising to 3,596 feet. Both islands are of volcanic origin. Anguilla is flat and composed of oligocene limestone and clay. Hot mineral springs with valuable medicinal properties are to be found near Charlestown, Nevis.

The Principal Towns are Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts, with a population of 13,500, and Charlestown, the capital of Nevis, population 3,600.

History

St. Kitts was colonized by Sir Thomas Warner in 1623. For more than a century it changed hands with the French as a result of constant
warfare, but was finally restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, as was Nevis (which was colonized in 1628) and both have remained British possessions since that date. Anguilla has remained a British possession since its colonization in 1650.

**Constitution**

The Executive Council for the Presidency consists of the Administrator (when the Governor is present) two other *ex officio* members, and one other official member. There are five unofficial members, of whom one represents Nevis.

Under an Ordinance of 1952 the Legislative Council comprises the Administrator (President), two *ex officio* members, eight elected members and three nominated members. An elected majority in the Legislative Council is thus provided for.

**Land Policy**

Aliens cannot own land except under licence from the Governor.

**Taxation**

The main taxes in force are Customs duty and income tax. Income tax rates range from 6d. in the £ to 15s. in the £ upon the chargeable income of an individual. Companies pay a flat rate of 6s. 6d. in the £. Other taxes are house, land and trade tax.

BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS

Area

The total area of the Presidency is 67 square miles. Excluding numerous small rocks, the islands number 36, of which 11 are inhabited. The largest are Tortola (20 square miles), Virgin Gorda (13 square miles), Anegada (11 square miles) and Jost van Dyke (7 square miles).

Geographical Features

The Islands, except for Anegada, represent a projection of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands archipelago. Anegada, a flat coral feature of more recent geological formation, is the northern outpost of the group in the Atlantic, and is surrounded by dangerous reefs. Virgin Gorda and Tortola rise abruptly like the tops of submerged mountains from a submarine plateau of 20–30 fathoms of water. The highest elevation is 1,780 feet on Sage Mountain, Tortola, where the remnants of an interesting xerophytic rain forest still exist.

Principal Town

Road Town, Tortola (population 1,000), is the seat of the Presidential Administration.

History

In 1648 a party of Dutch buccaneers are said to have set up their abode at Soper's Hole, Tortola, but were driven out by a party of English adventurers in 1666. In 1672 Colonel Stapleton, Governor of the Leeward Islands, took Tortola from the Dutch, who were then in possession. It was not, however, until 1680, according to Suckling, that the islands were permanently settled by English planters from Anguilla; they have been uninterruptedly British since then. In 1773 the Settlers were granted a charter and the first House of Assembly was convened the following year.

Constitution

The Commissioner, who is the chief executive, administers the Government under the Governor of the Leeward Islands. The Commissioner is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of himself as the ex officio member (when the Governor is present) and two official and three unofficial Appointed Members. The Virgin Islands Constitution Act, 1950, under which the legislature was constituted, was replaced by the Virgin Islands Constitution and Elections Ordinance, 1954, which provides for a Legislative Council with an elected majority elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The Legislative Council consists of the Commissioner as President, two nominated official members, two nominated non-official members and six elected members. The Council elects at its first meeting a Deputy President who presides in the absence of the Commissioner.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot hold land except under licence from the Governor. Such licences are granted only on condition that the alien undertakes to carry out some development and agrees to expend on the property a certain sum of money within a fixed period of years, usually three to four.

The total area of Crown lands is estimated at 18,000 acres. Most of it is situated in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. In Anegada, where the soil is poor, the occupants of Crown lands are allowed the use of those lands free of charge but rentals are collected from occupants of Crown lands elsewhere, where there is good soil fertility. Arrangements exist for the sale of Crown lands to occupants in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. Non-natives own approximately 2,626 acres of the total land area of the Presidency. The prevailing type of tenure for all holdings is fee simple.
Taxation

Taxes consist mainly of Customs duties and land, house, road, animal, boat and income taxes. Import duties average 12% ad valorem at general rates and 8% ad valorem at preferential rates. Export duties are fixed at specific rates which average less than 5% at current market values.

The income tax rate upon the chargeable income of every person other than a company, ranges from 6d. to 13s. 6d. in the £. Companies pay a flat rate of 5s. 6d. in every £.

Development Plans

The Presidency has been granted allocations totalling £106,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. Expenditure on schemes up to 1952 has been undertaken mainly on school buildings, agricultural and livestock development, water supplies and health projects. Since 1953 a road construction programme has been in progress; additional staff has been recruited for the Public Works Department to carry out the programme, and road-making machinery and plant have been purchased. Schemes have also been approved, and plans are well advanced, for the installation of radiotelephones both for internal and external communication, and for a piped water supply for Road Town.

Education

There is one Secondary and post-Primary, and one Primary school, maintained by Government; eleven denominational schools, which receive grants from Government funds; and three private schools. In 1953, there were 943 male and 995 female pupils enrolled at all schools. Attendance was approximately 76·1% of enrolment.

The cost of primary education, except the provision and maintenance of denominational school buildings, is met from Government funds and in 1953 the sum of $69,060 was so expended, compared with $3,446 in 1938.

Libraries

There is a Library in Road Town, said to be one of the best of the small libraries in the British Caribbean. There are library deposit services in the out islands. In 1953 the Library had a total of 1,873 books and 976 registered borrowers.

Health

The Tortola Cottage Hospital has 30 beds, and a total of 600 out-patients received treatment during 1953. There were 525 in-patients. The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1953 was $51,101 compared with $2,592 in 1938.

Communications

Launches maintain a mail and passenger service with St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, whence air, sea and cable communications exist to all parts of the world. Through-bookings can be obtained at St. Thomas to almost any destination in Europe or the western hemisphere. There is no broadcasting or radiocommunications service in the Presidency.

The Principal Occupation is stock-raising. Others are fishing, and the production of food crops and charcoal.

The Main Food Crops are vegetables and fruit. The estimated livestock population is:—cattle 4,519, sheep 1,130, goats 4,443, swine 1,160. The fishing industry is unorganized.
