ADEN COLONY

Area
Aden Colony is situated about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia. The area is 75 square miles (exclusive of Perim and the Kuria Muria Islands).

Population
In 1954 the population, excluding military personnel and construction workers at the new refinery, was estimated at 150,000.

Geographical Features
The Colony consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas, joined by a flat sandy foreshore, comprising:
(a) The peninsula on which are situated the main town known as Crater, the wharf and shipyard area of Maala, the modern harbour suburb known as Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased to the Air Ministry for R.A.F. and military purposes and known collectively as Steamer Point.
(b) The isthmus known as Khormaksar where a large R.A.F. station is situated.
(c) The strip of mainland between the two peninsulas which encloses the modern harbour and contains the township of Sheikh Othman and the villages of Hiswa and Imad.
(d) The Little Aden peninsula where a modern refinery is being constructed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited and where the two fishing villages of Bureika and Fukum lie.

The Island of Perim, and the Kuria Muria Islands off the Dhufar Coast of Oman, also form part of the Colony.

Climate
The climate is not unhealthy, though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent, but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

History
The plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden led to the capture of Aden by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company in 1839 under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy.

The need to establish coaling stations on trade routes because of the replacement of sailing ships by steamers was one of the reasons which led to the occupation of Aden by the British. Little Aden was obtained by purchase in 1868. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the Island the same year. It was later re-occupied by the British in January 1857.

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden from 1st April, 1937.

Constitution
The Executive Council of the Colony consists of the officers lawfully discharging the functions of Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed by Her Majesty or as the Governor may appoint in pursuance of instructions from Her Majesty or as the Governor may provisionally appoint in the manner provided in the Royal Instructions. Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, which was brought into force from the 24th October, 1946, a Legislative Council was constituted for the Colony of Aden. It consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, no more than four official members and no more than eight unofficial members.

Land Policy
Under the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1945, the Governor is empowered to lease or otherwise alienate in Her Majesty's behalf any Crown Land for building, agricultural or any other purpose, on any terms and conditions, as he may think fit.

Taxation
Aden is a free port and there is no general Customs tariff, but taxes are levied on alcoholic liquor, tobacco and motor spirit. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for the payment of a graduated income tax by individuals ranging from 4 per cent. to 75 per cent. on chargeable income. Companies pay at a rate of 37½ per cent.

| Expenditure |
|-------------|
| £           |
| Social Services | 345,594 |
| Public Works | 431,202 |
| Development | 786,532 |

Currency
The currency in circulation is the East African Shilling, issued by the East African Currency Board. It is issued in denominations of 100s., 20s., 10s., and 5s. notes and 1s., 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent coins.
Development Plans

Aden Colony has been granted an allocation of £300,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. In 1954 it was estimated that the amount needed to complete the programme was £6,485,232. The programme is being financed through a Development Fund, which derives its revenue from allocations from surplus balances, Colonial Development and Welfare grants, and loans floated in London and partially allocated locally. The programme provides for expenditure as follows:

| Service                  | Expenditure (£) |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Social Services          | 2,073,725       |
| Communications           | 672,442         |
| Public Utilities         | 1,566,700       |
| Housing                  | 1,524,014       |
| Miscellaneous            | 648,351         |

A further sum of £4,000,000 is being spent on Capital Works in connexion with the development of Little Aden where the new oil refinery has been sited. The sum of £4,000,000 is being financed by a loan from Her Majesty's Government and will be repaid over a period of 30 years.

Education in Aden Colony is under the control of a Director, who also advises in both the Eastern and Western Protectorates. In 1954 there were in the Colony some 3,820 pupils (2,720 boys and 1,100 girls) in Government schools, some 2,650 (1,750 boys and 900 girls) in grant-aided schools, and some 1,500 (1,300 boys and 200 girls) in recognized private schools. In addition there are numerous unrecognized groups of children attending Koranic schools. The educational system consists of four years of primary, three years of intermediate and four years of secondary schooling. Secondary education is almost entirely in the hands of Government, which has provided two fine colleges for this purpose—Aden College, which prepares boys for the examinations of the London University General Certificate of Education and the Technical College where courses in carpentry and joinery, machine-shop engineering, and automobile engineering are given, leading to the City and Guilds examinations. Aden College also provides a one-year teacher-training course for men. Girls' education, at the Girls' Intermediate School, is taken as far as the intermediate stage and, for selected girls, is followed by a two-year course of training for teachers.

An evening institute offering courses in various technical subjects is also run at the Technical College and adult evening classes in academic subjects are also provided by the Education Department.

There are at present 15 men and women on scholarships in the United Kingdom.

The expenditure on Colony education has risen from £6,600 in 1936 to £129,403 in 1953–54. During this period some £300,000 has been spent on capital works.

Libraries

Amenities for the teaching profession include a club with a library of over 2,000 volumes. The Lake Library is now administered by the Municipality. There are also well stocked libraries at both the Colleges.

Health

The principal diseases in Aden are those of the gastro-intestinal system, pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia and tuberculosis. Preventive measures against flies and mosquitoes have been very successful.

Beds available:

- Civil Hospital .................................. 360
- Maternity Clinic .................................. 50 beds, 40 cots
- Infectious Diseases Hospital .................... 31
- Mission Hospital .................................. 72

In-patients at the Civil Hospital totalled 5,025, out-patients totalled 129,697. There are three Government and two private charitable dispensaries at which 110,280 cases were treated, 32,220 of them at the Government dispensaries.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953–54 was £239,444, compared with £13,230 in 1936.

Communications

A Civil Airport has been constructed within the limits of the Royal Air Force Aerodrome at Khormaksar. Regular and reliable services are available to all the surrounding territories and to the Protectorate. There are regular air services between Aden and the United Kingdom.

The Colony has a total of 76·47 miles of roads, of which 57·80 are bituminous macadam surfaced. There are no railways.

The vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and the number of vessels, exclusive of country craft, which entered the Port of Aden during 1953 was 4,645 with a tonnage of 19,746,754. The number of country craft which entered the Port during the same period was 1,676 with an aggregate tonnage of 128,543. There are 16 first-class berths, including nine oil berths suitable for large vessels; four second-class berths, including two oil berths suitable for vessels of medium size; six third-class berths suitable for small vessels. The oil berths are connected to the land installation by submarine pipeline; all berths are available for the supply of bunker coal and general purposes. The approach channel and the major portion of the mooring basin is dredged to 36 feet.

Broadcasting

Aden Broadcasting Service was inaugurated in August, 1954 and transmits daily in Arabic from 15.45 hours GMT to 17.30 hours GMT simultaneously on short wave 49.6 metres and medium wave 292 metres.

Principal Occupations

Of the estimated labour force approximately 4,500 are engaged in Port activities such as bunkering, handling and transhipment of cargo, ship repairing and dhow building and the duties performed by pilots, crews of harbour vessels, light keepers and so forth. The cleaning, sorting and packing for re-export of hides, skins, coffee, incense and gums is one of the Colony's oldest but diminishing trades in which only some 400 workers are now employed. On the other hand the retail and catering trades are expanding and jointly provide work for more than 2,000 workers. Factories employ some 4,000 workers.
Main Products

There is no agriculture in the Colony and the only local product is salt. This industry employs some 1,250 workers. Production in 1953 was 240,423 tons.

There is a primitive inshore fishing industry. The catch is mostly pelagic fish; it is sold both to the fresh market and to the salt fish exporters.

The factories in the Colony refine oil, produce soap, aluminium domestic utensils, building materials, cigarettes, mineral waters, ice, etc., and dye and print cloth. These, and small producers of cloth by handloom, supply the local demand and provide for export to adjoining territories.

Trade (excluding bullion and specie)

| Year | Imports   | Exports   |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1938 | £5,310,075 | £2,680,591 |
| 1949 | £32,753,355 | £25,412,696 |
| 1950 | £41,838,218 | £39,019,270 |
| 1951 | £50,216,736 | £44,366,410 |
| 1952 | £56,474,508 | £45,551,755 |
| 1953 | £61,165,329 | £41,254,525 |

* Includes ships' stores and bunkers.

Apart from the export of salt, the bulk of the trade of Aden falls into two main classes, namely, entrepôt and transhipment. The raw produce of neighbouring countries is transshipped at Aden to consuming countries in the vicinity. The salient features of the import trade are repeated in the export figures, as the bulk of imports are re-exported or sold in Aden for consumption outside. The principal business is in skins, hides, coffee, cotton piece-goods, cotton yarns, dates, grain, pulse and flour, sugar, tea, spices, oils, tobacco, gums, shells and salt.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are no marketing and co-operative organizations in the Colony but the recently created Co-operative and Marketing Department will supervise the marketing of produce, in the interests of both the producer and the consumer, and establish producer co-operatives.

PROTECTORATE

Area

The total area is approximately 112,000 square miles, including the Island of Socotra. The Protectorate is divided into Western and Eastern Areas.

Population is estimated at:

- Western Area: 450,000
- Eastern Area: 350,000

Geographical Features

The Aden Protectorate is bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen, and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges, about 1,000–2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains, over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Empty Quarter with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate also has a littoral belt, which is backed by a rock plateau rising to a height of 6,000 feet and continuing inland for about 100 miles, where it breaks up into a system of wadis, some fertile, leading into the main Wadi Hadhramaut. Beyond, to the north, are the sands of the Empty Quarter.

Climate

The altitude, which ranges from sea level up to 8,000 feet, is responsible for considerable variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. On the coastal plain torrid tropical conditions of great heat and humidity exist in the summer months. During the same period in the mid-altitude zones it is hot but less humid, while at the highest altitudes the climate is warm and temperate but can in the winter be extremely cold. The whole area falls within the influence of the north-east and south-west monsoons. Rainfall in the coastal areas averages approximately two inches a year; in the most favoured areas of the Western Aden Protectorate highlands it may average ten inches. In general, rainfall decreases from west to east until, in the north-east section, conditions of extreme aridity are encountered.

Mukeiras, a hill station on the Audhali plateau at 7,200 feet, is being developed as a summer resort for people seeking a respite from the heat of Aden.

Towns

There are no large towns in the Western Aden Protectorate but in the Eastern Protectorate Mukalla, the sea port, is of some size.

History

For a time in the eighteenth century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana’a in the Yemen and several of the rulers of the tribal districts were the Imam’s “wakils” or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with Her Majesty’s Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being the Audhali Sultan in 1914.

In July 1915, during the first World War, the Turks, who had conquered the Yemen in the course of the previous century, occupied the Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts of the Protectorate until the Armistice of 1918.
In 1934 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Her Majesty's Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen. There was an Exchange of Notes in 1950 when it was agreed to establish reciprocal diplomatic missions and to set up a Frontier Commission.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa'i Sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala) entered into closer relations with His Majesty's Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. Similar treaties were signed by the Upper Aulaqi Sheikh and the Audhali Sultan in 1952, and by the Sheikh of Shu'eib in 1954. In 1952 the newly elected Sultan of Lahej accepted a political officer as adviser.

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri Sultans and the rise of the Qu'a'iti—a new Yafa'i dynasty which gained power and wealth from military and other services rendered by its members abroad to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu'a'iti rulers first entered into a treaty with Her Majesty's Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri Sultan made an agreement with the Qu'a'iti Sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu'a'iti and Kathiri Sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British resident adviser in all matters except those concerning Mohammediain religion and custom. The Wahidi Sultan of Balhaf signed an Advisory Treaty in 1949, and a similar treaty was signed by the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra in 1954.

Administration

Her Majesty's Government does not administer the Protectorate directly but the British Advisory Staff advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas.

In the Western Aden Protectorate the States nominate their own heads, who have subsequently to be recognized by the Governor of Aden. Not all the heads of States and tribal chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery and in several States an efficient administration is now functioning. There are now State Councils in Lower Yafa'i, Amiri, Lower Aulaqi, Shu'eib, Fadhli, Dathina, Beihan and Upper Aulaqi and there is a Legislative Council in Lahej. For internal security some of the States have tribal guards (some partly paid for by Her Majesty's Government as a temporary measure) under the joint control of the Adviser and British Agent and the heads of States. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force known as the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate. They are stationed inland in fixed posts and are paid for and controlled entirely by Her Majesty's Government.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal States are the Qu'a'iti and Kathiri which are administered by their Sultans as constitutional rulers and have State Councils. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the supervision of the Resident Adviser and British Agent, Eastern Aden Protectorate. The island of Socotra is linked administratively with the mainland territory of Qishn under the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra.

Land Policy

Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammediain law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenous inhabitants. The local State Governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trusts (waqfs). Land settlement is in progress in the Abyan area.

Taxation

The bulk of revenue collected by the Protectorate States comes from indirect taxes in the shape of Customs, excise and licence dues; in addition tithes are collected on agricultural products.

Public Finance

The following is a summary of Her Majesty's Government's expenditure in the Protectorate for the years 1952-53 and 1953-54:

| Year       | £       |
|------------|---------|
| 1952-53    | £359,051|
| 1953-54    | £387,569|

The latest figures of estimated revenue and expenditure of State administrations which have adopted regular accounting methods are as follows:

Currency

East African Shillings and Rivals (Maria Theresa dollars) are the currency used.

Development Plans

The Aden Protectorate received an allocation of £500,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards various schemes.

The main development scheme, that in Abyan initiated in 1947, aims to achieve a better use of land and water resources, and has developed at a satisfactory rate in all fields where adequate staff, machinery and materials could be mustered. The scheme is administered by the Abyan Board which contains State and Government representatives and which works in partnership with landowners and owner-occupiers or tenant farmers. Cotton is grown as a main crop and marketed by the Board. An area of approximately 50,000 acres is now controlled for irrigation farming out of an estimated gross area of 120,000 acres.

Other Development

The Qu'aiti State has three development schemes for the coastal, central and wadi areas covering a total allocation of £139,000, to encourage and develop local industries, mostly agriculture. Similarly the Kathiri State has £23,500 allocated for agricultural development.

Education in the States varies greatly in development, the Qu'aiti State being at present the most advanced. It has a school of six post-primary standards at Ghil Ba-Wazir. At Lahej in the Abdali State there is an Intermediate School following the Egyptian syllabus, and a second intermediate school at Zinjibar in the Fadhli State serves the Western Protectorate. There are about 400 boys at these schools. Below this level there are 76 primary (or lower than primary) schools with a total of some 5,000 boys. This does not include small Koranic schools which are found in many places, nor the private schools of strongly religious bias, of which there are more than 20 in the Wadi Hadhramaut alone.

Girls' education is of fairly recent development. There are now five schools following the primary syllabus—two at Mukalla, one at Seiyun, one at Zinjibar and one at Shuqra—with a total of about 290 girls. In addition there are ten girls' schools and one mixed school of a lower level with about 700 girls. Most of these are in the Eastern Protectorate.

Thirty students are on scholarships abroad, 7 in the Sudan, 14 in Egypt, 4 in Syria, and 5 in Iraq.

Recurrent expenditure on education has risen from £22,000 in 1947 to nearly £66,000 in 1954 (£14,700 from Her Majesty's Government).

Health

A Health Adviser, Aden Protectorate, first appointed in 1951, is based on Mukalla and is responsible for the health services in both Protectorates. Organized State health services exist in the West in Fadhli and Lower Yafai (which share in a combined service with the Abyan Board) and in Lahej. The Qu'aiti and Kathiri States in the Eastern Protectorate have their own health services. Elsewhere States contribute in a varying degree towards services provided by Her Majesty's Government. An Assistant Health Adviser in each Protectorate is the local administrative and field executive for the areas which as yet have no developed services of their own, and assists the Health Adviser in all his functions. There are 57 rural health units in charge of Health Assistants, with some sub-professional staff trained in simple curative and preventive practices. There are ten mobile doctor's units. In the West at Makhyan (Abyan) and in the East at Mukalla there are base hospitals with associated training centres.

Communications

A regular air service by Aden Airways is maintained throughout the year between Aden and Mukeiras, and Aden, Riyan (18 miles from Mukalla) Al Qatn and Al Ghuraf in the Wadi Hadhramaut.

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate. Increasing use is being made of motor vehicles. These are for the most part driven along sandy beaches, dry river beds or across open desert, but several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic and in a few cases new roads have been cut through difficult country. Roads are extremely rough and surfaces are infrequently repaired. Routes for new and improved roads are being surveyed.

A coastal road in the Eastern Aden Protectorate runs from Reidat al Abdal Wadud in the east through Shihr, Mukalla, Bir Ali and Balhaf to connect with the Western Protectorate. Roads run inland from Shihr and Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut and from near Balhaf to Azzan and Habban. The desert between the Wadi Hadhramaut and Beihan is also traversed by motors. Where these cannot yet penetrate the traffic is carried on camel caravans, which still travel to Aden from the Western Aden Protectorate and to Mukalla and Shihr from other parts of the Eastern Aden Protectorate in large numbers. Donkeys are also employed for both passengers and goods.

Sea communications along the coast of the Protectorate are mainly by dhows, some of which have auxiliary engines. Small powered craft and coastal steamers make occasional and irregular visits to Mukalla and Shihr from Aden.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture employs about 90 per cent. of the population; other occupations are fishing, dyeing, weaving, and preparation of hides and skins.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sorghum, millet, bulrush millet, wheat, barley, sesame, cotton (long staple), dates, Hamami tobacco.

The number of 400 lb. bales of cotton produced since the start of the Abyan Scheme is:

| Year | Bales |
|------|-------|
| 1949 | 100   |
| 1950 | 1,587 |
| 1951 | 9,890 |
| 1952 | 7,206 |
| 1953 | 11,161|
| 1954 | 24,000 approx |

A rough estimate of the livestock population is:

- Camels: 80,000
- Cattle: 68,000
- Goats: 855,000
- Sheep: 200,000
- Donkeys: 7,000

The annual catch of wet fish has been estimated at 50,000 tons for a good season. At least 75 per cent. of this is taken in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. Most of the fish is cured for consumption inland and for export to East Africa and the Far East.
External Trade

The principal imports are grain, flour, rice, dates, sugar, sesame oil, tea, kerosene, spice, cloth, cotton piece-goods, tobacco, cigarettes, soap, glassware.

The principal exports are cotton, coffee, skins and hides, lime, Hamami tobacco, cattle, ghee, sheep, goats, fish.

The great bulk of trade with the Western Aden Protectorate goes by land from the town of Aden, and that with the Eastern Aden Protectorate goes by sea to the port of Mukalla. No reliable figures are available.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Three Farmers' Associations have been established in the Western Aden Protectorate, and a Date Farmers' Association has been started in the Kathiri State.

KAMARAN ISLAND

The island of Kamaran in the Red Sea has been in British occupation since 1915. It does not form part of either the Colony of Aden or the Aden Protectorate, but the Governor of Aden is also the Governor of Kamaran under the provisions of the Kamaran Order in Council, 1949. Prior to that date the island was under the control of the Government of India, exercised through the Governor of Aden and a local Civil Administrator, whose designation became Commissioner in 1949. Until 1953 a Quarantine Station was run in Kamaran for pilgrims on their way to Jedda by sea. This has now been closed down.

Estimated expenditure on the administration of Kamaran in 1954-55 was £19,003, of which £14,799 was to be contributed by Her Majesty's Government as a grant-in-aid.

The island has an airport and Aden Airways planes land there on scheduled services.
