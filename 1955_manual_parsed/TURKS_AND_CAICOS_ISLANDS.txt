TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

Area
The Turks Islands Bank and the Caicos Bank cover an area of approximately 70 by 50 miles. The total land area is estimated at 166 square miles.

Population
In 1952 the population was estimated at 6,600: Turks Islands 2,175, Caicos Islands 4,425. Of the total, 80 were of European, 4,441 of African and 2,079 of mixed descent.

Geographical Features
Geographically the islands are a part of the Bahama chain and have the same flat characteristics, there being no land above 250 feet. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by a 20-mile stretch of ocean water known as the Turks Islands passage; the Caicos Islands are surrounded by a shallow water reef. The islands generally are arid and stony.

Climate
The south-east trade winds blow constantly throughout the year, giving an equable and healthy climate. Rainfall is variable and tends to be higher in the Caicos Islands; on Grand Turk the annual average is about 21 inches. The mean annual temperature in 1952 was 79.2°. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1926, 1928 and 1945.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable and Wireless Limited at Grand Turk.

Principal Towns
The towns and largest settlement are Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour (South Caicos) and Bottle Creek (North Caicos), with populations of 1,945, 940 and 1,850 respectively.

History
The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the southern States of America after the War of Independence. After the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, their former slaves remaining in possession. In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, but in 1848 a separate charter was granted to the islands divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas. After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 petitioned Her Majesty that the islands might be annexed to the Colony of Jamaica and from 1874 to the present time they have been one of its dependencies.

In 1953 the U.S. Government completed a Guided Missiles Observer Station at Grand Turk, under an extension of the Bahamas Agreement.

A United States Government Naval Facility for Oceanographic Measurement was established at Grand Turk in 1954.

Constitution
An Order in Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica made provision for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. This Board now consists of four official and four unofficial nominated members appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. The Commissioner is ex officio President of the Board, which has full legislative and budgetary powers, but ordinances require the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming law. Laws passed by the Legislature of Jamaica do not apply to the Dependency unless they are made applicable in express terms. The revenues and expenditure are independent of those of Jamaica.

Land Policy
Much of the land on the salt islands is held on private freehold title. The law limiting the rights of aliens to own land was repealed in 1953.

Taxation
The main heads of taxation are Customs import duties, royalty on salt and stamp sales. There is no direct taxation.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938-39 | 9,780      | 13,830         |
| 1949-50 | 101,477    | 107,040        |
| 1950-51 | 77,297     | 91,588         |
| 1951-52 | 121,767    | 143,213        |
| 1952-53 | 78,389     | 78,760         |
| 1953-54 | 73,103     | 64,047         |

The estimated revenue and expenditure for 1954-55 are £61,098 and £60,993 respectively.

Development Plans
Up to March 31, 1954, the total assistance approved under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, 1940 and 1945, for the Dependency by way of grant amounted to £158,363, plus an interest-free loan of £50,000 towards the cost of taking over the salt industry from its previous owners. The main heads of expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds up to the end of 1955-56 are estimated to be as follows:

| Head                      | Amount (£) |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Agriculture and Minor Industries | 15,710    |
| Communications            | 20,118     |
| Education                 | 21,965     |
| Miscellaneous             | 8,898      |
| Public Health             | 46,412     |
| Salt Industry             | 81,310     |
| Social Welfare            | 3,433      |
| Water Supplies            | 10,517     |
| **Total**                 | **£208,363** |

Other Development
Prior to 1953 90% of the import trade of the Dependency was handled by the Competent Authority, a department of the Government. The profits on a turn-over of some £130,000 were almost entirely devoted to food subsidization. All food subsidies ceased on 1st April, 1952, and in November of that year the Competent Authority's department was converted into a government-owned trading corporation known as the Turks Islands Importers, Ltd. No further government sponsored development is envisaged, and great difficulty is being experienced in meeting the recurrent costs of the developments effected in recent years.

Education
There are 12 Government Elementary Schools and one Senior School in the Dependency. In 1952 there were some 1,000 pupils on the rolls and the average attendance was 800. Expenditure on education during 1953-54 amounted to £5,500, compared with £840 in 1935.
Libraries

There is a public library at Grand Turk.

Health

A 16-bed cottage hospital of modern design has just been completed at Grand Turk, together with a dental clinic. Medical officers, seconded from Jamaica, are stationed at Grand Turk and at East Harbour on South Caicos. There is a clinic at Cockburn Harbour and a maternity clinic at Bottle Creek on North Caicos. Total expenditure on medical services in 1953–54 was £7,738, compared with £90 in 1935. Half the salaries of all trained staff is now contributed by the Jamaica Government.

Communications

There are airfields at Grand Turk and South Caicos. The former is a military airstrip constructed by the United States Government in connexion with the Guided Missile Project. A weekly air mail service operates through Nassau in the Bahamas. A monthly air service is operated by British West Indian Airways out of Kingston, Jamaica. There is a monthly mail, freight and passenger service to Jamaica by sea and ships call occasionally from England and the United States.

Grand Turk is an important junction of cables to Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda. A radio telephone system connects Grand Turk with Salt Cay and the Caicos as well as providing a service with Jamaica and the United States.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of the Turks Islands group and of South Caicos are normally engaged in the production (by solar evaporation) and shipping of salt, but the industry is now in a state of acute depression owing to lack of modern loading facilities. The remainder of the Caicos population are mainly fishermen, and do a limited amount of subsistence agriculture. A large proportion of the male population is usually absent from home working in the Bahamas lumber camps, the Inagua salt works or as crews on merchant ships.

Main Crops and Products

Sisal is grown under conditions of peasant agriculture in the Caicos Islands, but the quality is poor, owing to the absence of fresh water for retting and washing. During 1953 46 tons were exported. Salt is the main product of the Dependency and the output over the past 25 years has averaged about 43,000 tons annually. Crawfish are exported frozen to Florida, and conchs are sold dried in Haiti.
