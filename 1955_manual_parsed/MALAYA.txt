FEDERATION OF MALAYA

Area

The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,690 square miles. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang and the smallest is the State of Perlis.

Population

The total estimated population at 31st December, 1953, was 5,814,668.

| Group                  | Population |
|------------------------|------------|
| Malaysians              | 2,858,096  |
| Chinese                 | 2,185,994  |
| Indians and Pakistanis  | 684,962    |
| Europeans               | 14,953     |
| Eurasians               | 12,034     |
| Others                  | 58,629     |
| **Total**               | **5,814,668** |

The Chinese predominate in the south-western States and in Penang, the commercial and industrial area, whereas there is a bigger percentage of Malaysians in the north and east and in Malacca.

Citizenship legislation which came into force on 15th September, 1952, confers citizenship by operation of law on all subjects of the rulers of the States and certain categories of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in the Federation. It is estimated that the number of persons who were citizens by operation of law at 31st December, 1953, was 4,173,000:

| Group                  | Population |
|------------------------|------------|
| Malaysians              | 2,745,000  |
| Chinese                 | 1,167,000  |
| Indians and Pakistanis  | 225,000    |
| Others                  | 36,000     |
| **Total**               | **4,173,000** |

As a general rule for non-Malays who are not Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies the qualification necessary for automatic citizenship and State nationality is to have been born in the Federation and to have had one parent born there also. Non-Malays without this qualification may, under certain conditions, acquire citizenship by registration or naturalization. The policy behind the legislation is to make citizenship available (i) by operation of law to anyone who by birth can be assumed to be sufficiently assimilated to the life and loyalty of the country; and (ii) by registration or naturalization to others who have reasonable qualifications to be regarded as Malayans.

Geographical Features

The Federation occupies the southern section of the Kra Peninsula, which protrudes at the south-eastern corner of Asia between India and China. It is divided by mountain ranges, the main trend of which is north and south. The highest mountain is Gunung Tahan, 7,186 feet. This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory on the Asian mainland south of the Himalayas. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country, while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains, which are mainly alluvial, and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80% of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp. The coastline of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west lies a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat, with infrequent indentations of bays. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand. Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands (rising to over 2,000 feet) off the north Kedah coast, and off the east coast, Tioman and other scattered islands.

The two principal rivers are the Perak and the Pahang, the latter some 200 miles long.

That part of the country cleared of forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas, as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other areas, particularly the Kinta Valley, Perak, have been mined for tin.

Climate

The principal features of the climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons, which correspond roughly with the summer and winter of northern latitudes; but, apart from the east coast, the differences of climate normally associated with the word "monsoon" are barely discernible in Malaya. On the east coast, and for a few miles inland, the wettest period is from November to January. In most other places, maximum rainfall occurs in October and November with a less pronounced maximum in March and April. Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year though the annual fall varies considerably from place to place and year to year. Jelebu in Negri Sembilan is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches, and Maxwell's Hill in Perak the wettest, with 199 inches a year.

The average maximum temperature in the plains is rather less than 90° F. and the minimum about 70° F. At the hill stations temperatures are considerably lower; at Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 80° F. and 36° F. and at Fraser's Hill 82° F. and 53° F. The nights are reasonably cool everywhere and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity, somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not possible at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate is desirable for Europeans if health is to be maintained. The highest temperature recorded in the plains during 1953 was 99° F. and the lowest 63° F.

History

In 1786 Francis Light obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795 during the Napoleonic wars, but was handed back to the Dutch in 1814. The loss of Malacca caused Stamford Raffles to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Temasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. Raffles obtained a concession from the representative of the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. As a free port Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands in 1824 when, by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London, Malaya was recognized as a British sphere of influence. The Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca and Singapore which at first came under the India Office, passed to the control of the Colonial Office in 1867. The extension of British authority into the Peninsula was hastened by unsettled conditions in the Malay States which had deteriorated in some cases into civil war and disorder. In 1873 the new Governor of the Straits Settlements came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the Treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern States by the Treaty of Bangkok. In 1910 agreements were concluded with Kelantan and Trengganu (the latter amended in 1919) in 1923 with Kedah and in 1930 with Perlis. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were similar in their main features. The Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in turn guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each State a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the Rulers agreed to follow in all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The foundations of good government and friendly relations laid by such early Residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories in the Commonwealth.

In the early years of the century Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a Federation (the Federated Malay States) with a Resident-General as chief executive officer, and a system of centralized government was inaugurated. This system lasted in varying forms until 1932, when there was a measure of decentralization by which legislative powers were to some extent restored to the States and the authority of the Rulers and Residents was reinforced.

Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt stop during the Japanese occupation from December 1941 to August 1945. On the liberation of the country, the Government of the Malayan Union was established, but this administrative system met with strong objections by the Malays and on the 1st February, 1948, a new Constitution came into force. The new Constitution allowed each State and Settlement to retain its individuality under a strong central government.

Constitution

The Federation of Malaya, which comprises the nine Malay states of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu and the two British Settlements of Penang and Malacca, was constituted on 1st February, 1948, by:

(a) the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, between His Majesty King George VI and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu;

(b) the State Agreements between His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers; and

(c) the Federation of Malaya Order in Council, 1948.

The Federation of Malaya Agreement, as from time to time amended, provides for an Executive Council of 20 members, presided over by the High Commissioner, and for a Legislative Council of 75 members presided over by a Speaker. Of the 75 Councillors, 50 are unofficial, representing various economic, commercial, professional and cultural interests, nine are Presidents of the Councils of State in the States, two represent the Settlement Councils of Penang and Malacca, three are ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary) and 11 are Members of the Federal Executive Council.

In the Executive Council, besides the three ex officio members and the Secretary for Defence, ten members have quasi-ministerial responsibilities for various functions and groups of departments. Their "Portfolios" are Home Affairs, Economic Affairs, Natural Resources, Health, Education, Industrial and Social Relations, Transport, Works, Posts and Telecommunications and Local Government, Housing and Town Planning. All except the members for Economic Affairs and Works are Asians. There are also two members without portfolio, both Asian.

The Federation Agreement also established a Conference of Rulers consisting of the Rulers of all the Malay States. The Conference meets the High Commissioner at least three times a year.

The State Agreements provide for the establishment of a State Executive Council and a Council of State in each State. The Council of State is the legislative body. In each of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca there is a Nominated Council and a Settlement Council. The Settlement Council, as the local legislative body, corresponds to the Council of State in a Malay State.

The Federation Agreement records the desire of His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers that progress be made towards self-government, and their agreement that, as a first step to this end, legislation shall be introduced as soon as
circumstances permit for the election of members to the various legislatures established under the Agreement.

**Emergency**

Since June 1948 a state of Emergency has existed in Malaya. Special powers were assumed by the Government in that month to preserve law and order in the face of outbreaks of violence perpetrated by the Malayan Communist Party. Communist terrorists have since then carried out guerrilla operations from jungle bases in an attempt, by ambush, murder and the destruction of property, to impose their will on the Malayan people. They have not succeeded in doing this, but they have caused a great deal of suffering to innocent people. The Government, with the assistance of its locally raised (and largely voluntary) Security Forces, as well as British and Commonwealth troops, and with the support of the large majority of the people of Malaya, has made great efforts to put down terrorism. After the murder in October 1951 of Sir Henry Gurney, the then High Commissioner and a devoted servant of the people of Malaya, General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed High Commissioner and Director of Operations and Mr. D. C. (now Sir Donald) MacGillivray, Deputy High Commissioner. These appointments were the first steps in a widespread reorganization of the Security Forces and other Government machinery.

By the time of General Templer’s departure in May 1954, terrorist activity had steeply declined and the increasing flow of information about the terrorists given to the Security Forces reflected the renewal of public confidence. This progress has continued under the regime of Sir Donald MacGillivray, who succeeded General Templer as High Commissioner, and of Lieutenant-General Sir Geoffrey Bourne, G.O.C. Malaya Command, who succeeded General Templer as Director of Operations. The problem of the Security Forces has now largely resolved itself into locating and attacking the “hard core” of some 5,000 Communist terrorists in their bases in the deep jungle, often protected by a screen of misled aborigines whose allegiance has to be won.

The campaign to end the Emergency is being fought simultaneously on social, political and economic fronts. More than half a million former “squatters” in the jungle fringes, where they were an easy prey for the Communist terrorists, have been resettled in the relative security of New Villages, with land, public amenities and the opportunity of running their own affairs through elected Village Councils. As far as the drain on the country’s finances caused by the Emergency will allow, social services, notably in the field of education, are being steadily developed. Political progress continues rapidly: elections were held last year to village, town, Municipal, and some State, Councils: the first elections to the Federal Legislative Council are being held this year and a Ministerial system of government adopted. Thus, side by side with the restoration of law and order, there can proceed, in accordance with the policy of Her Majesty’s Government, the development of a united, democratic and ultimately self-governing Malayan nation.

**Land Policy**

The Torrens system of registration of title to land is in force in the Federation, except in the Settlements of Penang and Malacca where it is intended to introduce registration of title as soon as is practicable. Most alienated land is held in perpetuity on payment of an annual rent to Government. It is now the usual practice, however, to alienate town land on 99-year leases. Malay Reservations have been created within which land may not be alienated to non-Malays. State land, not lying within Malay Reservations, and Crown land may be alienated to Federal citizens and non-Federal citizens.

**Taxation**

The most important form of taxation is indirect by means of export duties on rubber and tin, and import duties on tobacco, beers, spirits, petrol and textiles. The main form of direct taxation is income tax. All persons not resident in the Federation are chargeable at a flat rate of 30%. There is provision for relief for a non-resident British subject or a non-resident British protected person. In the case of individuals resident in the Federation, $3,000 is deductible from assessable income if the individual is unmarried. A further allowance of $2,000 is made to a married man. Allowances are also made in respect of children up to nine in number, for life assurance premiums paid, and for obligatory or contractual contributions to approved pension or provident funds. The rate of tax on the chargeable income remaining after the above-mentioned allowances have been made varies from 3% on the first $500 to 30% on chargeable income in excess of $50,000. The rate of tax chargeable on the income of companies was raised to 30% in 1951. A double taxation relief arrangement with the United Kingdom is in operation.

The nine State and two Settlement Governments have their own budgets for local administration which are balanced by allocations from Federal funds. The figures given above represent the totals of Federal, State and Settlement revenue and expenditure in each year. The figures of revenue for 1949, 1950, 1952 and 1953 include contributions from Her Majesty’s Government in aid of defence expenditure of $42,857,143 (£5 million), $25,714,286 (£3 million), $3,385,714 (£395,000) and $1,200,000 (£140,000) respectively.

Approximately 51% of the revenue in 1953 was derived from Customs and excise and 26% from income tax. The main heads of expenditure in 1953 were:

The value of the Sinking Funds at 31st December, 1953, was $82,038,887.

The Federation of Malaya’s share of the Straits Settlements Public Debt is $14,849,629.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is exclusive legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency notes of denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, and $1 issued by:
   (a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners.
   (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.
   (c) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel and cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iii) Copper coin and bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

Silver coins ceased to be legal tender from 31st December, 1952.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The nominal circulation on 31st December, 1953, was:
- notes $740,923,669,
- coins $23,037,410.33.

Development Plans

A six-year Draft Development Plan was prepared in 1950 and it is intended that its revision should shortly be undertaken. The latest estimates of the cost of schemes in the Development Plan show expenditure up to 1957 of the following order:

|                | $ million | Per cent. |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Basic Services | 445       | 52·8      |
| Social Services| 255       | 30·2      |
| Productive Services | 144 | 17·0      |
| Total          | 844       | 100·0     |

Basic Services.—26·5% of the total expenditure will be devoted to the development of electricity, 12·0% to railways and 4·1% to water supplies.

Social Services.—12·2% of the total expenditure will be spent on the resettlement of squatters in New Villages, 7·3% on education and 7·0% on housing.

Productive Services.—10·4% of the total expenditure will be allocated to the Rural and Industrial Development Authority for projects of all kinds directed towards the development of rural areas, and 4·5% on drainage and irrigation works.

The sources of funds are:
(a) the Malayan allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, $42·8 million.
(b) the Colonial Development Corporation, which so far has provided about $60·7 million towards the development of electric power;
(c) Federation of Malaya Government Loans, $309 million;
(d) Revenue; and
(e) other sources not yet explored.

Education

The University of Malaya, serving the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, has faculties of Arts, Science and Medicine. In the 1953–54 session there were 554 students from the Federation. The Technical College, Kuala Lumpur, had 238 students, and the Agricultural College, Serdang, 71 students. Government awards scholarships and bursaries for higher education, tenable at the University of Malaya or in the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand. There are 300 students being trained as teachers at the Malayan Teachers’ Training College, Kirkby, Lancashire, 150 at a New Training College in Kota Bharu, Kelantan, and in addition there are over 1,100 Malayan students at Universities and centres of higher learning overseas. In 1953 there were 148,384 pupils in 325 English Schools (schools for mixed races where the medium of instruction is English), 347,253 pupils in 2,055 Malay Schools, 252,065 pupils in 1,214 Chinese Schools and 43,878 pupils in 869 Indian Schools. With Government aid, Adult Education Associations have been formed in all States and Settlements. At the end of 1953 these had organized 847 classes in vernacular literacy and English, with about 20,000 adult students enrolled. Government grants to the Association in that year totalled $304,882.

Expenditure on Educational Services in 1953 was about $103,953,910, of which $2,327,505 was contributed by the United Kingdom under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

There are museums in Kuala Lumpur and in Taiping, both of which have libraries, and new museums have been established in Malacca, Seremban and Penang. Under the Preservation of Books Ordinance, 1950, three copies of all publications printed in the Federation are required to be sent to the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur. The Malayan Historical Society, founded in 1953, is producing district and town histories and recording much information which would otherwise be lost. Archaeological and anthropological research is conducted from the National Museum.

Health

In 1953 Government maintained 70 hospitals with 12,687 beds; general 8,212, maternity 1,228 and infectious—including pulmonary tuberculosis—3,247. In addition, Government maintains four institutions with 3,470 beds for the treatment of leprosy and two mental hospitals of 4,200 beds. At Government hospitals the total number of in-patients treated was 236,633 (general 233,286,
mental 2,641, and leprosy 706). On rubber estates there are 120 hospitals maintained privately with 5,477 beds; 86,014 in-patients were admitted during 1953. Treatment of the rural population is carried out through dispensaries (including mobile road and river boat units) and infant welfare centres. These number 169, 75, 15 and 476 respectively, and the total number of new cases treated was 4,204,110.

The total expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1953 was $47,124,758 compared with $16,623,487 in 1947. A further $1,576,311 was spent on the emergency expansion of health services in new villages.

The principal diseases treated in Government hospitals throughout the Federation were as follows:

- Malaria 7,712, pulmonary tuberculosis 5,847, dysentery 1,865, diarrhoea and enteritis 5,412, pneumonia 4,600, bronchitis 7,923, beri-beri 498, venereal diseases 1,661 and enteric fever 753.

The main anti-malarial measures in towns and villages are sub-soil drainage by permanent works, oiling and D.D.T. spraying of houses. Water supplies are treated according to modern methods, sanitation is either water-borne or by bucket system of removal in all the towns.

Communications

About 1,300 route miles are covered by domestic air services. The Dakota fleet of Malayan Airways Limited serves the eight main aerodromes (Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Penang, Alor Star, Kota Bharu, Kuantan and Malacca), and in addition 13 smaller towns are served by the Beaver aircraft of the Federation Air Service which are owned by Government and operate under the management of the Malayan Railway Administration.

Malayan Airways operate 30 services each week between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and also provide services from the Federation to Medan thrice weekly, to Bangkok and Saigon, once weekly. Thai Airways and Union of Burma Airways operate to Penang from Saigon and Rangoon respectively.

The route mileage of the Malayan Railway open to traffic in 1953 was 984. The main line runs from Singapore 488 miles north-westwards to Prai (opposite Penang Island); there are short branches to the west coast, and a longer branch (99 miles) from Bukit Mertajam northwards to the Thailand frontier at Padang Besar; the east coast line runs from Gemas (137 miles from Singapore) northwards 327 miles to Tumpat on the north-east coast of the peninsula.

The Malayan Railway connects with the Thailand Railway at Padang Besar and Sungai Golok.

Passenger journeys in 1953 totalled 6,631,893 and paying goods tonnage 2,043,073. Gross revenue reached the record figure of $58.5 million; total working expenditure was $50.8 million.

The Public Works Department maintains about 6,238 miles of public road, of which 4,100 miles is metalled surface, grouted or sealed with bitumen, 308 metalled surface waterbound, 882 hard surface waterbound, 683 earth surface, 244 hard surface bitumen sealed, and 21 concrete surface.

The principal ports in the Federation are Penang and Port Swettenham: the numbers and net registered tonnages of ships of 75 tons and over which entered and cleared thereat during 1953 were:

| Port          | Entered | Cleared |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Penang        | 2,142   | 2,151   |
| Port Swettenham | 1,180   | 1,182   |

N.R.T.: 5,913,000 5,929,000 4,414,000 4,274,000

Tonnages of cargo (in "freight" tons) discharged and loaded, including cargo from and to ships of 75 tons and under were:

| Port          | Tonnes |
|---------------|--------|
| Penang        | 1,750,851 |
| Port Swettenham | 1,145,349 |

Navigational aids around the 800-mile coast are maintained by the Marine Department.

Services to and from the United Kingdom are provided by the main shipping companies on the Far Eastern service. Local companies provide coastal services to ports in South-East Asia.

Broadcasting

The Department of Broadcasting is pan-Malayan. It maintains stations of "Radio Malaya" at Kuala Lumpur (two 10 kW. medium wave transmitters, and one 5 kW. shortwave), Penang (two 2 kW. medium wave), and Malacca (one 250 watt medium wave) but much of the Federation is served by the shortwave transmitters of "Radio Malaya", Singapore. There were 121,850 licence holders in the Federation on 31st December, 1953, including 11,025 subscribers to Rediffusion (Malaya) Limited. Over 1,600 schools in the Federation are equipped with receivers for the reception of school broadcasts from Radio Malaya. Special rural broadcasts in Malay, Tamil, Mandarin and six other Chinese dialects are broadcast from the Federation transmitters. They are also heard on about 1,000 community receivers installed in rural areas by the Government and on receivers installed on several hundred mines and estates for the benefit of the workers.

Work is proceeding on the new broadcasting centre at Kuala Lumpur, and the Studios are expected to be fully operative by 1955.

Principal Occupations

Apart from the 200,000–250,000 who are self-employed in peasant agriculture (including rubber smallholdings) or fishing, the larger part of the working population is engaged directly or indirectly in the rubber industry.

Rubber plantations and estates .. 281,390
Coconut, oil-palm and tea plantations .. 26,028
Tin industry .. 37,515
Bus companies .. 6,320
Civil Government—labourers .. 62,661
Armed Forces—labourers .. 4,938
Miscellaneous undertakings .. 68,305

These figures, except for bus companies, apply only to "labourers" as defined in the Labour Laws of the territory.

There are 240 registered trade unions of employers and employees, consisting of 140 Civil Servants' Unions, 93 Industrial Workers' Unions and seven Employers' Unions. Civil Servants' Unions have 41,139 members who are drawn from all races and from 22 different types of Government occupations. Industrial Workers' Unions have 67,916 members drawn from about 27 different categories of employment. The seven Employers' Unions have a membership of 791, of whom the Rubber and Tin Employers' Unions are...
The main crops are rubber, rice, oil palm, coconuts, pineapples and tea. There are 3½ million acres of land under rubber, more than half the area under all agricultural crops. Rubber small-holdings cover 1½ million acres. Total production in 1953 was 572,792 tons.

The livestock population numbers: cattle, including buffaloes 522,000, goats 289,000, sheep 160,000, pigs 306,000, equines 600.

The bulk of the commercial timber of Malaya is produced by the Dipterocarapaceae, but much timber is produced which is not at present of commercial value. The outturn of logs in 1953 was 900,000 tons of 50 cubic feet round, all of which were sawn locally. There is a flourishing export trade in graded sawn timber mainly to the United Kingdom and Australia, which totalled 40,000 tons in 1953; 25,000 tons of ungraded lumber were exported, mainly to Aden and the Persian Gulf.

The total production of fish per annum is now of the order of 177,000 tons, with a retail value of $95,000,000. Of this total, approximately 122,000 tons is produced in the Federation and 55,000 tons is landed in Singapore; 25,000 tons come from fresh water sources, mostly fishpond culture. $3,000,000 worth of the total fish production is used as manure and animal fodder. Approximately 15,200 tons of dried fish is produced in the Federation and exported through Singapore to many parts of Asia.

Mineral production during 1953 was as follows:

- Tin concentrates: 75,005 tons
- Iron ore: 1,062,678 tons
- Coal: 286,364 tons
- Gold: 18,283 oz. (troy)
- Bauxite: 152,170 tons
- Ilmenite: 26,570 tons (exports)
- Columbite: 52 tons
- Wolfram: 99 tons
- Scheelite: 30 tons
- China clay: 1,241 tons

The Federation of Malaya was responsible for 1-2% of the world's total production of tin concentrates and the value of her exports of tin metal during 1953 was $220 million; other mineral exports were valued at $25,556,566.

Manufactures include tyres and tubes, bricks (over 28 million in 1953), canvas/rubber and other footwear and soap (10,735 tons in 1953).

In 1947, 19·3% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 24·7% from other Commonwealth countries, 19·2% from Indonesia, and 36·8% from other foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1953 were, 20·5%, 18·9%, 24·5% and 36·1%.

In 1947, 16·1% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 19·7% to other Commonwealth countries, 33·9% to U.S.A., and 30·3% to other foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1953 were 16·7%, 21·4%, 16·5%, and 45·4%.

About 40% of the Federation's import and export trade is channelled through Singapore. An increasing proportion, however, particularly of imports, is being channelled through Federation ports. Trade with the United Kingdom has increased reflecting the improved supply position from that source. Similarly Commonwealth imports (particularly from Australia) have been increasing slowly. Imports from neighbouring territories have fallen to more normal levels from the peak of 1950–51 when rubber and tin were booming. As a result of improved availabilities from soft currency sources of supply, imports from Canada and the U.S.A. have declined slightly.

The United States, however, has been one of the largest customers, although exports have declined since the high figures after the war resulting from heavy purchases of rubber and tin. Exports to the United Kingdom are now at about the same level as to the U.S.A. having been lower immediately after the war. Exports to neighbouring territories have fluctuated with changing conditions, both economic and political, and appear to be declining. To Japan, however, they are increasing and the balance of trade has turned sharply so that exports are nearly double imports.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

On 31st December, 1953, there were 1,663 co-operative societies with 195,807 members and working capital of $27,794,771 (Malayan), or approximately £3,243,264.

Marketing and processing societies amongst smallholders increased from 99 to 136. The majority of these were rubber marketing co-operative societies, fishing and marketing societies, and rice milling co-operative societies.
