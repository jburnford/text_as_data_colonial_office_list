TANGANYIKA

Area

The total area of the territory is 362,688 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of inland water. The land area (in square miles) of the eight Provinces into which the Territory is divided is as follows: Central 36,410, Eastern 42,094, Lake 39,134, Northern 32,165, Southern 55,223, Southern Highlands 45,472, Tanga 13,803 and Western 78,405.

Population

Eight million Africans (1953 estimate), 17,885 Europeans, 56,499 Indians, 3,240 Goans, 13,025 Arabs, 2,060 Somalis, 1,576 coloured, 1,209 others—total non-African population (1952 census) 95,494. Among the Africans some 120 tribes can be distinguished. Some of these number only a few thousand persons, while the largest tribe in the Territory, the Sukuma, represents 12% of the African population and numbers nearly 900,000. Other large tribes in numerical order are the Nyamwezi, Ha, Makonde, Gogo, Haya and Chagga. These seven tribes together comprise...
35% of the African population, and with the addition of a further six smaller tribes next in order make just 50% of the total African population.

Geographical Features

The two extremes of topographical relief of the whole continent of Africa lie within the boundaries of the Territory—Kilimanjaro, with a permanent ice-cap, rising to 19,565 feet above sea-level, and the deep trough-like depression filled by the waters of Lake Tanganyika, the world’s second deepest lake. Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to the great central plateau, which for the most part maintains an altitude of some 4,000 feet, is sharply defined along both its eastern and western margins by a series of steep-sided and deeply eroded escarpments, and falls sharply to the west to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika 2,534 feet; Nyasa 1,568 feet) which lie in the trough of the great Rift Valley. Along both the eastern and western escarpment edges the plateau has been elevated to form long but relatively narrow belts of high country, rising in several places to over 7,000 feet. In the west this belt is cut by the valley of the Malagarasi River. This valley provides a drainage outlet to Lake Tanganyika from a large part of the central plateau, and thus extends the Congo-Atlantic drainage basin to within about 350 miles of the Indian Ocean. The escarpment to the east of Lake Nyasa is broken by the Ruhuhu River. The valley of the Ruhuhu is of importance as forming possibly the only practical alignment for a rail connexion between the coast and Lake Nyasa. Approximately half of the two great lakes, Victoria and Tanganyika, lie within the Territory’s borders, and lakes Natron, Manyara, Eyasi (in the north) and Rukwa (in the southwest) account for most of the remainder of the 20,000 square miles of inland water.

Climate

Roughly, three climatic zones can be distinguished:

(i) The coast region and immediately adjoining hinterland—tropical, temperature seldom below 80° during October–May, when the two rainy seasons occur; between June and September it is much cooler. Average temperature 76°; average rainfall 40 inches.

(ii) The central plateau, altitudes 2,000–4,000 feet—prevailing characteristics low humidity, rainfall 20–40 inches annually, mean temperature over 70° with great daily and seasonal variations, sometimes exceeding 30° daily; nights almost invariably cool.

(iii) The semi-temperate regions round the slopes of Kilimanjaro (19,565 feet) and Meru (14,979 feet) to the north of the Territory, the “Winter Highlands” further west, the Usambara and Pare Highlands in the north-east, the Fipa Plateau in the south-west, and the mountainous areas to the north and east of Lake Nyasa (5,000 to 10,000 feet). Frosts at higher altitudes, nights cold.

Generally speaking, the rainfall is low for a tropical country. Except for the northern and middle sections of the coastal belt, where the advent of the rain is dependent on the south-east and the north-east monsoon currents, and the areas around Lake Victoria and the north of Lake Nyasa—where there are two distinct rainy seasons—the greater part of the Territory has generally a one-season rainfall, beginning in November or December and continuing more or less unbrokenly to the end of April or May.

History

The country now known as Tanganyika came under German influence largely through the initiative of Dr. Karl Peters. In 1884 he journeyed into the interior and concluded twelve treaties with chiefs whose chiefdoms were then declared to be German territory. In 1885 the land he had acquired was placed under the protection of the Imperial German Government. A ten-mile belt along the coast was regarded as belonging to Zanzibar, but in 1888 Germany acquired the right of collecting duties on the coast and in 1890 took over the coastal strip on payment of £200,000 to the Sultan of Zanzibar. For some time after their acquisition of the territory the Germans were engaged in quelling risings, and in 1905 there broke out a serious rebellion, known as the “maji-maji” rising, in the southern areas and extending from Lake Nyasa in the interior to Kiwa on the coast.

Soon after the outbreak of the 1914–18 war clashes took place between British and German forces on the northern frontier of the Territory, but the serious attempt to occupy the country did not begin until 1916. By the end of that year all the country north of the Central Railway was occupied by British or Belgian forces and a provisional Civil Administration was established for that area on the 1st January, 1917. In November 1917 the German forces were driven across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese East Africa and the occupation of the whole of the Territory was then completed. By the Treaty of Peace with Germany, signed at Versailles in 1919, Germany renounced in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights over her overseas possessions, including her East African colony. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that His Britannic Majesty should exercise a mandate to administer this former German colony, except for the areas of Ruanda and Urundi, for which the mandate was given to the Belgian Government. In 1920 the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Territory was constituted. Since then the administration of the Territory has continued to be carried out under the terms of the Mandate until the establishment of the Trusteeship System under the Charter of the United Nations.
Constitution

The basis of the administration of the Territory in international constitutional law is the Trusteeship Agreement approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1946. The basis of the administration in demotic constitutional law is in Orders in Council under the United Kingdom Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890.

The Territory is administered by the Governor assisted by an Executive Council consisting of ex officio, nominated official and unofficial members. The function of this Council is to advise the Governor on all matters which the law prescribes should be dealt with by the Governor in Council and on such other matters as he may see fit to refer to the Council. If in any matter the Governor takes action contrary to the advice of the Council, he must report the circumstances to the Secretary of State, giving the grounds and reasons for his action.

The Legislative Council, as at present constituted, consists of a Speaker, 15 ex officio and nominated official members and 14 unofficial members.

In 1954 the Governor announced proposals to increase the Legislative Council in 1955 to 61 members, 31 being ex officio and nominated and the remaining 30 (ten Africans, ten Asians and ten Europeans) being representative members.

Land Policy

All public lands and all rights over them are under the control of and subject to the disposition of the Governor to be held and administered for the use and common benefit, direct or indirect, of the natives of the territory and no title to the occupation and use of any such lands is valid without the consent of the Governor who, in exercise of his powers, is obliged to have regard to the customary laws and customs of the indigenous inhabitants. Freehold title over public land may not be created or granted except in giving effect to any contract or undertaking by the former German Government or in substitution thereof. The Governor may make grants of rights of occupancy over public land to both native and non-native persons for terms not exceeding 99 years, demand a rental and revise the rental at stated intervals.

Taxation

The tax system includes indirect taxation in the form of import, export and excise duties, stamp duties, and miscellaneous licence fees.

Particulars of direct taxation are set out below.

(a) Native House and Poll Tax. House tax is payable in respect of every "native dwelling"; poll tax by every able-bodied male member of the indigenous population of the age of 18 and over who is not liable for house tax, other than those specifically exempted.

(b) Non-Native Poll Tax is payable by all males of the age of 18 and over who are not liable for taxes leviable under the native tax laws; it is graded in relation to individual incomes.

(c) Non-Native Education Tax is payable by every male non-native over 18 resident in the Territory, and assessed on poll tax payable.

(d) Municipal House Tax is levied on owners of houses in townships, not including native dwellings, at rates not exceeding 15% of the net annual value of the house. The tax is not normally leviable in those townships where local rates are in force.

(e) Estate Duty is payable at graduated rates on any deceased estate of a value exceeding £100.

(f) Income Tax.—Resident individuals pay Shs. 1/50 on each £ of the first £400 of chargeable income; where this exceeds £400, upon the whole chargeable income at the rate of Shs. 1/50 in the £ with the addition of one-eighth of a cent for every £ of chargeable income in excess of £400 up to a total of £1,600, at which point the rate is Shs. 3/- in the £. On chargeable income in excess of £1,600 the rate is Shs. 5/- in the £. Where the total income exceeds £2,000 a surtax is payable of Shs. -/25 cents, increasing by one-eighth of a cent up to a total income of £3,500, and thereafter by one-twentieth of a cent up to a maximum rate of surtax of Shs. 9/-.

Non-resident individuals pay at the rate of Shs. 2/- where chargeable income does not exceed £800. Where it exceeds £800 the rate is the same as for residents.

The income of individuals is subject to their personal allowances.

Limited companies pay at the rate of Shs. 5/- in the £.

Public Finance

The following table includes both Territorial and Development Plan Accounts.

| Year | Revenue* | Expenditure* |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1938 | 2,113,244 | 2,223,896    |
| 1949 | 10,067,407 | 9,199,540   |
| 1950 | 12,567,039 | 12,804,231  |

| 1953 | 17,887,212 | 18,092,383  |

* Contributions from Territorial to Development Funds are excluded from the former's expenditure and the latter's revenue.

In 1954-55 it is estimated that the sum of £5 million will be received from Customs and Excise duties, over £6 million from licences and taxes and £3½ million from Development Plan Account. In the same year the main heads of expenditure are £1 million on Development Plan Account, approximately £2 million Public Works, £1½ million Education, over £1¼ million Medical Services, over £800,000 each for Miscellaneous Services, Police and Provincial Administration, £600,000 for Pensions and Gratuities, £470,000 for Agriculture and £370,000 for Veterinary, and £700,000 East Africa High Commission.

The Public Debt at 30th June, 1954 amounted to £11,003,470 (approximately £1 9s. 5d. per head of population) and comprised:

| Loan Description | Amount |
|------------------|--------|
| Loans from Imperial Funds | 853,470 |
| Guaranteed Loan, 1952-72 | 500,000 |
| Barclays Overseas Development Corporation Loan | 210,000 |
| Inscribed Stock, 1970-73 | 4,030,000 |
| Tanganyika Stock 1967-72 | 4,410,000 |
| Lint and Seed Marketing Board Loan | 1,000,000 |

£11,003,470

Currency

This is issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The British East Africa shilling is the standard coin. Subsidiary coins
are of the following denominations: 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents and 50 cents. There are 100 cents to the shilling. Currency notes are issued in the following denominations: Sh. 5/-, Sh. 10/-, Sh. 20/-, Sh. 100/-, Sh. 200/- and Sh. 1,000/-

Development Plans

Since 1948 there has been a steady rate of development and it is anticipated that this development will continue at a rate of £4 million per annum of capital expenditure. The following figures are of interest in illustrating the development which has taken place in the past six years:

| Year | Amount (£) |
|------|-----------|
| 1948 | 851,000   |
| 1949 | 1,687,000 |
| 1950 | 3,438,000 |
| 1951 | 3,830,000 |
| 1952 | 5,409,000 |
| 1953 | 3,699,000 |

These funds come from a variety of sources but the main items are Loan Funds, Colonial Development and Welfare Grants and contributions from Tanganyika Revenue.

A new development plan covering the period 1955-60 is at present under preparation.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation's wattle plantations in the Njombe district now extend over an area of 23,790 acres. In the gold mine acquired by the Corporation in the Musoma district, considerable developments have taken place, but operations in their tin mine in the Bukoba district have been curtailed due to the fall in the price of tin.

The modified programme pursued by the Overseas Food Corporation lays stress on such crops as velvet beans, soya beans, millet, and tobacco, in addition to groundnuts. Ranching is being undertaken in the Kongwa area.

The D'Arcy Exploration Company jointly with the Shell Exploration Company is prospecting for oil in the coastal belt under an exclusive licence and a new company is being formed to carry this work to its next stage. Preparations to cut out deep drilling on Mafia Island are nearing completion.

Work on the deep water berths at Mtwara and on the Southern Province railway has been completed, but work continues on the deep water berths at Dar es Salaam and on improved harbour facilities at Tanga.

Following on a preliminary reconnaissance by an F.A.O. expert in 1953, a survey of the Rufiji basin by a team of F.A.O. experts, assisted by members of Government and the Overseas Food Corporation, was undertaken during 1954 and is expected to continue on a larger scale in 1955-56, the whole project being financed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The object of the survey is to lay down the main lines of the development of the basin and to ensure that such development as is immediately possible is in line with the overall scheme.

Education

Facilities for higher education are provided by the University College of Makerere at Kampala in Uganda. African students from Tanganyika who qualify for entrance to Makerere at present are required to pay fees of only £40 towards the cost of tuition and residence at the College, the balance being met from Government funds; provision exists for the remission of these fees in cases of need. The number of students in residence from Tanganyika in 1953 was 88. The present target is for 200 students from Tanganyika to attend Makerere in 1956. At the end of 1953 there were five Africans at Universities and four attending co-operative courses in the United Kingdom. About 59 Asians from Tanganyika are studying in the United Kingdom.

An increasing number of Africans are completing the full Secondary school course and 86 passed the Cambridge School Certificate Examination in 1953. The system of African education has been revised under the Ten-Year Plan for African Education which provides for three stages up to the secondary level; the Primary school covers Standards I-IV; the Middle school V-VIII and the Secondary school IX-XII inclusive. It is hoped that there will be, by 1956, 310,000 Primary pupils, 32,100 Middle school pupils and 3,720 Secondary pupils. One trade school accommodating 500 pupils is already in being and the building of a second is in hand. The sum of £50,000 has been contributed to the Royal Technical College of East Africa at Nairobi which is intended to provide advanced technical training for East African students of all races.

Facilities for European, Indian and other non-native education are provided by the European and Indian Education Authorities and by the Advisory Committee on other Non-native (including Goan) Education. Each of these Authorities has its own fund to which Government makes a substantial contribution annually. Seven Government Primary schools, one with a Secondary school attached, 16 assisted schools and five unassisted schools together with a Government Correspondence School give primary education to 1,821 and secondary education to 264 European pupils; 12,852 Indian pupils are attending three Government Primary schools and 97 assisted Primary schools, and 4,586 Indians are receiving secondary education at two Government schools and 32 assisted schools. Another 758 non-natives are receiving primary education and 162 secondary education at two assisted schools for other non-natives.

Expenditure on educational services during 1953 amounted to approximately £2,997,937, of which £169,797 was contributed from Development Funds and approximately £392,107 by Native Authorities. In 1935 the total expenditure was £81,100.

Libraries

In Dar es Salaam there are the King George V Museum Library, the Hindu Mandal Public Library, the Arnautoglu Library which caters for all races and contains books in English, Swahili and Arabic, and the Law Library situated in the Legal Department and open to all members of the legal profession. In addition there is the East African Literacy Bureau Library, which caters largely for Africans and has branches throughout the territory.

Health

There are 474 out-patient dispensaries maintained by Native Authorities, eight by Government, 65 by grant-earning missions and 282 by private bodies and industry. The Native Authorities maintain 32 maternity and child health clinics, Government 37 and missions 69. There are 16 major leprosaria of which some are maintained by Government and some by grant-aided missions. Government, missions and industrial concerns
maintain a total of 195 hospitals and bedded dispensaries with 10,395 beds. During 1953 209,851 in-patients and 4,549,521 out-patients were treated at Government and mission hospitals and dispensaries, and at Native Authority dispensaries.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953 was £1,364,051, of which £130,000 was contributed from Development Funds for capital expenditure on medical buildings. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £193,930. These figures exclude such items as medical building works provided for in the Public Works estimates and public health measures undertaken by the various township authorities or the expenditure on medical services by industry and voluntary agencies.

Communications

New international airport and terminal buildings have been opened at Dar es Salaam.

There are 21 scheduled aerodromes of which three—Dar es Salaam, Tabora and Lindi—are capable of taking large aircraft in all weathers. Internal air transport is conducted by the East African Airways Corporation. The Corporation operates a network of scheduled services connecting the main administrative and commercial centres of Tanganyika, Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. The Central African Airways Corporation operates services between Nairobi and Southern Rhodesia. Small charter aircraft are based at Dar es Salaam, Mbeya and Bukoba. Meteorological services are available and are controlled by the East African Meteorological Department with a territorial office in Dar es Salaam. External services connect with the services of the East African and Central African Airways Corporations. B.O.A.C. operates a Hermes service once a week between Dar es Salaam and London.

The railways of the Territory are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission").

There are 545 miles of roads in townships, 50 in other settlements, 3,243 miles of main roads, 3,688 miles of Grade A District roads, 10,423 miles of Grade B District roads and approximately 8,000 miles of village roads.

Six shipping lines operate services from and to Europe and South Africa, two lines operate services to India and South Africa, one line operates to Portuguese East Africa, two lines operate from Europe to and from Indonesia, six lines operate services to and from the United States of America, one line to and from France and Madagascar, one line between Germany and East Africa, one line between Australia, New Zealand and East Africa, and one line between East Canada and East Africa. Coastal services between Tanganyika, Kenya and Zanzibar are operated by six lines.

Passenger and freight services are operated on Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Administration and on Lake Nyasa by Nyasaland Railways Limited. These steamer services connect the railways of Tanganyika with those of Kenya and Uganda and the transport systems of the Belgian Congo, Ruanda Urundi and Northern Rhodesia.

Broadcasting

The building of a new Broadcasting Station commenced in 1954 and a 20 kW short wave transmitter is being installed, which it is hoped will provide effective coverage for the whole territory. This is a Government project financed largely from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. "Fee nil" licences are issued.

Principal Occupations

Most of the self-employed indigenous inhabitants are engaged in agriculture. The numbers of African adult males employed (at a census on 31st July, 1953) are classified in the following major industrial groups:

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are 190 African, five Asian and two multi-racial co-operative organizations with a total membership of 174,276 persons, a share capital of £93,582, and surplus and reserve of £799,247.

There are four main groups of primary marketing societies affiliated to four Unions: Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union Limited, the Bukoba Co-operative Union Limited, the Rungwe Co-operative Union Limited, and the Ngoni-Matengo Co-operative Marketing Union Limited, of which the first three deal in coffee and the last in tobacco. The largest is the Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union Limited to which 32 societies with nearly 35,000 members are affiliated. In addition, there is the Tanganyika Co-operative Trading Agency Limited, which handles the marketing of mild coffees of all societies other than those comprised in the Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union. All the mild coffee produced by co-operative societies is marketed through the Moshi auctions while the hard coffee is marketed on the Mombasa auctions.

New marketing primary societies formed during the year were chiefly concerned with the marketing of cotton in the Lake Province where a considerable expansion of the co-operative movement is taking place.

In addition to the co-operative societies, statutory Marketing Boards exist for cotton (territorial); coffee (Bukoba, Moshi, Arusha); tobacco (Songea, Nyamirembe) and ghee (Central Province).
