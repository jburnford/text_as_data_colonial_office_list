SARAWAK

Area

The area of the Colony is approximately 47,071 square miles.

Population

The estimate at the end of 1954 was 605,000. The following are the figures given for the various groups:

| Group                  | Number |
|------------------------|--------|
| Sea Dayak (or Iban)    | 213,200|
| Chinese                | 167,700|
| Malay and Melanau      | 137,700|
| Land Dayak             | 47,500 |
| Other indigenous       | 32,200 |
| Other non-indigenous   | 6,700  |

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of a coastal strip some 450 miles long and varying from 40 to 120 miles wide on the north-west coast of the island of Borneo. A broken range of mountains runs south-west through the middle of the island, and Sarawak lies between this range and the sea. The southern border with West, or Indonesian, Borneo, is formed by another range of mountains running westerly from about the centre of the main range. The country is divided into three main zones. Firstly, an alluvial and swampy coastal plain in which isolated mountains and mountain groups rise to 2,000 feet or more, then rolling country of yellow sandy clay intersected by ranges of mountains, and finally a mountainous area in the interior. The highest peak is Murud, 7,950 feet. The Rejang (350 miles long) and Sarawak Rivers are navigable for ocean-going ships for 170 and 22 miles respectively. Others are navigable by coastal steamers or launches. Most of the rivers have shallow bars which limit the size of the vessels entering. In the Trusan, Limbang, Baram and Rejang Rivers, gorges and dangerous rapids occur well below the sources. Lowland
tropical rain forest covers approximately 34,000 square miles, or 72% of the land area of the Colony. Much of this forest is inaccessible until the internal communications of the country can be improved.

Climate

The climate is humid, day temperatures averaging 85°. October to March is the season of the northeast monsoon, with heavy rains, strong winds and high seas. Except for a transitional month, the remainder of the year has less rainfall, with occasional droughts lasting up to three weeks.

In the coastal area from Miri to Labuan most of the rainfall is between midnight and dawn. In 1951 at Kuching 157·26 inches were recorded; the maximum monthly rainfall was 18·45 inches in October, the minimum 8·30 inches in June.

Principal Towns

| Town          | Approximate Population |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Kuching (capital) | 45,500                 |
| Sibu          | 12,000                 |
| Miri          | 10,600                 |
| Limbang       | 3,300                  |
| Simanggang    | 2,900                  |

Miri owes its existence to the Sarawak oilfields. It was almost entirely destroyed as a result of the war but reconstruction is now far advanced.

History

The history of Sarawak as an integral State begins with the first landing of James Brooke in 1839. At that time Sarawak was the southern province of the Brunei Sultanate. The oppression of the Sultan's viceroy, Makota, had goaded Malays and Land Dayaks into revolt. James Brooke interceded in the dispute, brought about a settlement and was rewarded for his services by being installed in 1841 as Rajah of the territory from Cape Datu to the Samarahan River. Thereafter Rajah Brooke devoted himself to the suppression of piracy and head-hunting, often with the assistance of ships of the Royal Navy, which performed almost incredible feats of navigation and endurance. Sarawak was recognized as an independent State by the United States of America in 1850, and by Great Britain in 1864. In 1861 the territory of Sarawak was enlarged by the Sultan's cession of all rivers and lands from the Sadong River to Kidurong Point.

At his death in 1868, Sir James Brooke bequeathed to his nephew and successor, Charles Brooke, a country paternally governed, with a solid foundation of mutual trust and affection between ruler and ruled. In 1882 the frontier was advanced beyond the Baram River. In 1885 the valley of the Trusan River was ceded and in 1890 the Limbang River was annexed at the request of the inhabitants. In 1905 the Lawas River area was purchased from the British North Borneo Company, with the consent of the British Government. British protection was accorded to Sarawak in 1888.

The third Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, succeeded his father in 1917, and progress continued in all spheres. In 1941, the centenary year of Brooke rule, the State was in a sound economic position with large reserves. To celebrate the centenary, the Rajah enacted a new constitution, and set his people on the first stage of the road to democratic self-government.

During the Japanese occupation, social services and communications were neglected; education ceased; health precautions were ignored; sickness and malnutrition spread throughout the State.

After the surrender of Japan, the Australian forces entered Kuching on the 11th September, 1945, and Sarawak was for seven months administered by a British Military Administration, as a result of whose efforts supplies of essential commodities were distributed, the constabulary re-formed and the medical and educational services reorganized. The Rajah resumed the administration of the State on the 15th April, 1946. It was, however, evident to him that greater resources and more technical and scientific experience were needed to restore to Sarawak her former prosperity. He therefore decided to hand the country over to the British Crown, and a Bill to this effect was introduced into the Council Negri in May 1946 and passed by a small majority. By an Order in Council the State became a British Colony on the 1st July, 1946.

Constitution

The constitution grants legislative and financial jurisdiction to the Council Negri, a body consisting of 25 members, 14 of whom are official members appointed from the Sarawak Civil Service and 11 of whom are unofficial members representative of the several peoples dwelling within the Colony and of their various interests. The unofficial members are appointed by the Governor in Council and hold office for a period of three years. In addition to the 25 members there are six Standing Members. The Council Negri has the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony and no public money may be expended except with the consent of the Council Negri. The Constitution Ordinance also provides for a Supreme Council composed of not less than five members, a majority of whom shall be members of the Sarawak Civil Service, and of the Council Negri.

All powers conferred upon the Rajah or the Rajah in Council by any written law enacted before the date of operation of the Cession of Sarawak to His Majesty are vested in the Governor in Council. In the exercise of his powers and duties the Governor shall consult with the Supreme Council, except in making appointments to the Supreme Council and in cases of immediate urgency or of slight importance.

Land Policy

All the land in the Colony is classified under one of the following headings: mixed zones; native areas; native customary lands; interior areas; or reserved lands. Alienation to non-natives is permitted only in mixed zones which the Director of Lands and Surveys may create from time to time in areas of not more than 500 acres: any area in excess of 500 acres requires the approval of the Governor in Council. In native areas only natives of Sarawak may obtain rights to land. The interior areas consist mostly of virgin jungle and any land occupied there consists entirely of native farming lands lying away from the main centres of trade and plantation industry and only general administrative control is exercised. Land may be alienated in large or small holdings, but small holdings predominate and the policy is one of encouragement for the smallholder to own his land.
Taxation

The only direct taxes levied on the native population by Government are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year, and the Malay "head tax" of $1 per year which is levied on all males of working age. These taxes are transferred to local authorities, where existent, who may in certain circumstances levy a cess of a similar amount on other indigenous races.

Income tax is levied on limited liability companies.

| Public Finance | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
|               | $       | $           |
| 1938         | 4,261,899 | 4,272,140   |
| 1949         | 15,349,662 | 17,945,155 |
| 1950         | 30,170,617 | 16,336,527 |
| 1951         | 47,349,365 | 22,517,207 |
| 1952         | 54,266,009 | 28,724,480 |
| 1953         | 39,219,785 | 35,629,303 |

Approximately 54% of the revenue was derived from Customs import and export duties in 1953; other sources are excise duties, licences and taxes, which include income tax on limited liability companies, and revenue from Government property. The main heads of expenditure in 1953 were: Contribution to Development, Welfare and Reconstruction Fund $8,900,000; Constabulary $3,614,514; Medical $3,068,535; Administration $2,090,944; Public Works Non-Recurrent $1,254,403; Public Works Department $1,432,100.

The Colony has no public debt.

Currency

By virtue of the Currency Ordinance, 1951, and Proclamation of November 1952, Sarawak currency ceased to be legal tender as from 31st December, 1952. Notes and coins might be exchanged thereafter only at a Sarawak Government Treasury. The legal tender in Sarawak is the notes and coins issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. The Malayan dollar = 2s. 4d. sterling.

The amount of currency in circulation at the end of 1953 was estimated to be:

- Malayan: $28,560,956
- Sarawak: $758,427

Development Plans

Sarawak's Development Plan has been revised, covering the period 1955-60, and is estimated to cost $99,500,000 (£11,608,000). The Plan is to be financed by Colonial Development and Welfare grants, Local Revenue, appropriations, accumulated Surplus Balances and Loan Funds. The total provision is divided as follows:

- Agriculture: $10,684,471
- Forestry: $690,600
- Fisheries: $158,720
- Communications: $54,226,683
- Fuel and Power: $1,515,500
- Education: $5,086,000
- Medical and Health: $14,800,348
- Miscellaneous: $12,244,209

The provision for Communications accounts for about 54% of the Plan and is to be spent on roads, port development, aviation, waterways and telecommunications.

Other Development

Industrial development is mainly in the hands of private enterprise, notably the oil industry. The Government has also spent about $74 million since 1947 on reconstruction and development.

Education

At the end of 1953 there were 512 schools in Sarawak, 32 of which provided secondary education. The number of children in school, which in 1947 was 29,616, had risen by 1953 to 49,072, of whom 44,499 were at the primary stage and 4,573 at the secondary stage. Of the total enrolment, 35,542 were Chinese pupils. Schools are under the management of Government, Local Authorities, Christian Mission bodies, Committees of Management of Chinese Schools, and Village School Committees. Twenty students were awarded scholarships in 1953 for further education and training overseas under various schemes. Teacher-training is carried on at a single Centre at Batu Lintang, near Kuching, where teachers are trained for all types of schools. The principal scheme of Community Development is at Kanowit where young married couples from the indigenous peoples receive a two-year residential course which aims at improving their methods of agriculture and raising their general standards of living. Expansion of educational services since the end of the war has largely been made possible by the encouragement of "self-help" methods on the part of local communities, particularly with regard to the provision and maintenance of primary school buildings and furniture. Estimated expenditure on education from public funds in 1953 was $2,047,529 (£238,878) of which $289,356 was contributed by the United Kingdom from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Sarawak Museum, at Kuching, is the only one in Borneo. Its research activities are largely concerned with the anthropology and ethnology of the country. Archaeological excavations are also in progress. The Public Library is housed in the Museum buildings; the British Council also maintain a library and reading room at Kuching and Sibu.

Health

Health and sanitation are good in the main centres but in the rural areas malaria and other diseases are very common. An extensive malaria eradication project is being planned. A large, new out-patient clinic was opened in Kuching in August, 1954.

Beds available at the Government hospitals number 660, of which 100 are reserved for mental cases. The Sarawak Oilfields Company's hospital at Miri has also a number of beds to meet its own need.

One of the 24 static dispensaries was closed down and, in spite of one less, the number of patients seen and treated was 176,106 compared with 134,538 the preceding year. The 16 Travelling Dispensaries which serve the coastal and remote population treated 58,842 patients; 4,721 patients received attention at the travelling road dispensaries. The total numbers treated in the Colony in 1953 were:

- Out-patients: 437,961
- In-patients: 9,967

28,663 people attended the ante- and post-natal clinics in 1953.

The total expenditure on the Medical Department during 1953 was $2,864,501·25, representing about 8·35% of the annual budget.
Communications

There are two airfields, one at Kuching and the other at Sibu. Malayan Airways Limited operate five services weekly in each direction between Singapore, Kuching and North Borneo centres; three of these services call at Sibu.

The road system is not extensive, owing largely to the nature of the terrain. The total mileage is about 470, approximately 80 miles having a bitumen or concrete surface, 77 miles metallised and 313 miles being dry weather earth roads and tracks.

The sea and rivers remain the chief means of surface communication. Regular steamship services are maintained, by the Sarawak Steamship Company and the Straits Steamship Company, between Singapore and the ports of Kuching, Sibu and Miri. There is also a local service calling at these ports and other centres up the coast. A large number of launches and small powered craft, mainly Chinese, ply up and down the main rivers and between ports, carrying passengers and cargo. The number and tonnage of overseas vessels calling at Sarawak ports (including timber ships and oil tankers) in 1953 was: arrivals 1,446 vessels with a tonnage of 3,080,190 and departures 1,460 vessels of a total tonnage of 3,067,159.

Broadcasting

Radio Sarawak, the Government broadcasting service, was inaugurated on 7th June, 1954, and broadcasts at strength 5 kW, in both the medium and short wave bands on one single transmission, with programmes in English, Malay, Mandarin and Iban (Sea Dayak). Studios, programme and administrative offices are at Broadcasting House in central Kuching. The transmitting station is about 1½ miles, and the receiver station 4½ miles, away. High quality medium wave coverage is given for a radius of 35 miles around Kuching and short wave reception is clear throughout the territories of British Borneo and in many other countries in the South-East Asian region.

Principal Occupations

Approximately 51% of the total population works at some gainful occupation and of this 45% are employed in some form of agriculture. The Chinese are to a large extent pepper and rubber planters. The Dayaks, Kayans and Kenyah are also farmers, employing primitive methods and engaged mainly in planting padi. The Melanaus, a coastal tribe, engage mainly in working sago and fishing. Sarawak Oilfields Limited employ 2,485, mostly Chinese, the balance Malays, Dayaks and Indians. The 63 sawmills in operation employ approximately 616 workers, the majority of them Dayaks, the others Malays and Chinese. The logging industry employs about 400, the majority being Dayaks, the balance Burmese, Indians and Malays, and there are about 276 cutch factory workers.

Sago, arrack, biscuit and soap manufacturing, pottery, brick-making and gold-mining are the other principal industrial occupations; communications and transport and rubber-packing also employ considerable numbers.

Twenty-four trade unions, with a total membership of 4,241 are registered.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops produced for export are rubber, sago, pepper and copra. Those produced for domestic consumption are padi, tapioca, maize, fruit and vegetables. (Local padi production is inadequate to meet local demands for rice, the staple diet, and there are considerable imports of rice.)

Animal husbandry plays only a small part at present in rural economy. About 6,000 head of buffalo are kept, mainly in the north.

Both marine and freshwater fisheries are of considerable importance, but production is inadequate to meet local needs and there are considerable imports of dried, salted and tinned fish. Fish-farming is becoming of increasing importance.

The Colony's mineral products are oil, gold, coal, antimony, mercury, diamonds, limestone, clay used for bricks and tiles, building stone and phosphate. Oil and gold have received the closest examination but, in common with the other minerals, a large amount of work remains to be carried out before their potentials are known.

The only major industry is the refining of oil. There are many small factories processing rural products scattered throughout the more accessible parts of the country—particularly padi mills and rubber smokehouses; sago factories are mainly confined to the sago-growing areas. There are 48 sawmills, a match factory, a cutch factory, a jelutong refinery, and three distilleries using the products of the nipah palm; all these are privately owned.

(a) Crude oil is piped to the refinery in Sarawak from the adjoining territory of Brunei, and constitutes most of the output. Crude oil from wells in Sarawak (50,000 tons in 1952 and 49,057 tons in 1953) is also treated at the same refinery and both crude and refined petroleums are included in the total exports.

In 1953 40·86% of exports went to Singapore, 9·88% to other British Colonies, 3·23% to Brunei, 4·86% to the United Kingdom and 41·17% to other countries.

In the same year 70·50% of imports came from Brunei (crude oil for refining, which is re-exported), 19·85% from Singapore, 2·34% from other British Colonies, 4% from the United Kingdom and 3·31% from other countries.
The chief imports, other than oil from Brunei, are foodstuffs, textiles, tobacco, beverages, and manufactured goods.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are no marketing boards, although control is exercised by Government over the standard grading of sago and pepper for export. Co-operative development commenced in 1949 and since then steady progress has been shown. By 31st August, 1954, there were about 139 societies in existence; rural credit totalled 28, thrift and credit 29, consumer 25, processing 25, padi saving and marketing 23, the balance being urban credit, a central bank and various others. The strongest support for co-operation is found in the rural areas among the Sea Dayaks, Malays, Melanau and Land Dayaks in that order, but the Chinese also are now showing increased interest. The Department of Co-operative Development is expanding rapidly but the demand for Co-operation is still ahead of the Department's capacity to supervise. A Co-operative Central Bank was registered in October 1953 and now acts as the banking agency of most Co-operatives.
