THE GOLD COAST

Area

The total area is 91,843 square miles (Colony 23,937, Ashanti 24,379, Northern Territories Protectorate 30,486, Trust Territory of Togoland 13,041 square miles).

Population

At the 1948 census the population was 4,118,450:

| African | Non-African |
|---------|------------|
| Gold Coast | 4,111,680 | 6,770 |
| Colony | 2,217,416 | 5,394 |
| Ashanti | 817,782 | 1,162 |
| Northern Territories | 1,076,482 | 214 |

The part of Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship (included in the above) 382,717 51

The total population of the Gold Coast in mid-1953 was estimated at 4,478,000.

Geographical Features

The Gold Coast is divided into three main zones:

(i) A narrow belt of plains and scrubland, 5–50 miles wide and following the coastline. It includes the Accra Plains and is intersected by rivers and streams. Only three rivers have permanently open mouths, guarded by shallow river bars.

(ii) A belt of tropical rain-forest extends northwards from the coast, near the western frontier, for some 170 miles. The area is broken by ranges of heavily wooded hills, some of which rise from 600–2,000 feet, and is intersected by numerous rivers and streams navigable only by canoes. This area produces most of the timber, cocoa and minerals which play an important part in the economy of the Gold Coast.

(iii) North of the forest belt the country undulates gently between 300–1,300 feet, and is mostly covered by orchard bush with park-like areas and stretches of treeless plains. A range of hills runs north and south along the eastern boundary reaching a maximum height of 2,900 feet.

Climate

Except in the north, there are two rainy seasons in the year, separated by a short comparatively dry spell in July and August and a longer dry season from December to February. During the rainy seasons the well-known West African squalls normally occur. In the Northern Territories the two rainy seasons tend to merge into one to the exclusion of the short dry spell. The longer dry season is correspondingly extended.

Dry north-easterly winds (the harmattan) reach the Gold Coast in January and February. They frequently bring particles of fine dust from the deserts in the north and cause a haze, which may become so thick as to impede navigation on the sea and in the air.

There are four fairly distinct climatic regions, namely the eastern coastal belt—warm and fairly dry; the south-west corner—warm and very humid; the forest belt—warm and humid; and the north—hot and dry:

| Zone               | Station | Mean Rainfall | Mean Max. Temp. °F. | Absolute Max. Temp. °F. |
|--------------------|---------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Eastern Coastal Belt | Accra   | 29 ins.       | 86                  | 94                     |
| South-west Corner  | Axim    | 83 ins.       | 85                  | 92                     |
| Forest Belt        | Kumasi  | 58 ins.       | 86                  | 96                     |

**History**

The Gold Coast first became known through Portuguese navigators, who visited the district in 1471 in their search for gold, ivory and spices. They built a chain of forts and castles along the Coast and these served as their trading posts. The slave trade later attracted the attention of traders of other European nations, notably the English and the Dutch; and in 1642 the Portuguese were compelled to abandon their possessions to the newcomers. By 1750, all the other European nations had relinquished their settlements on the Coast with the exception of the English, the Dutch and the Danes, who had their headquarters at Cape Coast, Elmina and Christiansborg respectively.

In 1821 the Imperial Government assumed full control of the British Settlements on the Coast; and by a convention made in 1871 the Dutch, who then remained the only other European nation on the Gold Coast, ceded their settlements to the British.

The Colony of the Gold Coast was created by Charter in July 1874, and in August of the same year an Order in Council empowered the Legislative Council to legislate for the new Colony by ordinance. Even then the Colony did not include all the areas under British protection as the boundaries remained undefined. To regularize the position, therefore, these protected areas were annexed as a British possession in 1901 and the boundaries of the Colony were fully defined by Order in Council in 1906.

In the interim the eighteenth century saw the rise of the formidable confederacy of the Ashantis, who soon began to demand a larger and a more direct share of the trade with the Europeans. As could be expected, the Coastal peoples resisted their demands, and this led to a continuous struggle. Eventually, in the nineteenth century, the Ashantis came into open conflict with the English, who tried to protect the Coastal peoples. In 1874, after a series of Ashanti wars, Sir Garnet Wolseley led a successful campaign against Kumasi, the stronghold of the Ashantis. After a final struggle in 1900, Ashanti was annexed to the British Crown in 1901, Prempeh, the King, was exiled and was only allowed to return in 1924. The Ashanti Confederacy was restored in 1935 and Prempeh's successor was proclaimed Asantehene, the Ashanti title for the head of the Ashanti nation.

The Northern Territories came under British rule after the conclusion of treaties with the Chiefs in 1897.

In 1922 a portion of the adjoining German territory of Togoland was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as a part of the Gold Coast. This strip of land became a Trusteeship Territory after the formation of the United Nations Organization.

**Constitution**

The Gold Coast is administered by a Governor with a Cabinet of Ministers and a Legislative Assembly. Under Letters Patent which came into force on the 18th of June, 1954 the Governor may appoint a Deputy Governor.

Under the Gold Coast (Constitution) Order in Council, 1954, which came into operation on the 18th of June 1954, there is provision for a Cabinet of Ministers consisting of not less than eight Members of the Legislative Assembly appointed by the Governor, acting in accordance with the constitutional convention applicable to the exercise of such functions in the United Kingdom by Her Majesty. The Prime Minister presides at meetings of the Cabinet, but at any special meeting summoned by the Governor the latter presides. The Prime Minister may charge any Minister with the responsibility for any department or subject other than certain subjects involving matters relating to defence and external affairs, for which the Governor is responsible.

The Legislative Assembly consists of a Speaker elected by the Assembly and 104 Members elected by direct election and representing seven municipal and 97 rural electoral districts.

The Constitution makes provision for the following:

(i) the appointment of Ministerial Secretaries from the Assembly,

(ii) the appointment of a Permanent Secretary in each Ministry and a Secretary to the Cabinet, who shall be public officers,

(iii) the appointment of an Auditor-General removable only by the Governor on an address of the Assembly, and

(iv) the establishment of a Public Service Commission and a Judicial Service Commission, certain provisions relating to which will be operative from 31st July, 1955.

The Constitution contains provisions concerning the retirement of certain officers from the Public Service and for the grant of compensatory pensions or lump sum compensation to such officers.

**Land Policy**

In the Colony and Ashanti the land is owned by Stools*, families or individuals, except such as has been acquired by the Crown, mainly for public purposes. Grants by natives, other than customary grants, are subject to the provisions of the Concessions Ordinance, 1939, and subsidiary legislation made thereunder. In the Northern Territories the control of all land is vested in the Governor and all minerals are vested in the Crown. The vesting of rights in land in non-natives is therefore controlled by the Government. In Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, the law applicable to the Colony applies to the Southern Section, and the law applicable to the

* Symbol of a Chief’s authority.
Northern Territories, to the Northern Section. In addition it is unlawful for any native without the consent of the Governor to alienate any interest in land to a non-native. In Kumasi, Accra, Sekondi-Takoradi and Cape Coast, Swedru and Sunyani all development is planned and controlled by statute. In other towns and villages development is planned and controlled by local authorities with the advice of the Ministry of Local Government.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on individuals, and on bodies of persons other than companies, on a graduated scale rising from 3d. in every £ of the first £200 of chargeable income to 11s. 6d. for every £ exceeding £10,000. The rate of tax upon companies is 9s. in the £, with relief for small companies incorporated locally during their first six years and for companies formally admitted as pioneer enterprises. Minerals duty is imposed upon the value of minerals won at rates varying with the profitability of the undertaking. Persons other than companies are exempt from this tax if they are engaged in winning diamonds or small quantities of gold only.

Currency

The currency in circulation is a West African currency issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African Territories. It consists of notes of 10s., 20s., and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s., and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d., ½d. and tenth penny. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par. The estimated total currency outstanding at 30th June, 1954, amounted to £31,675,000.

Development Plans

The first Development Plan of the Gold Coast, which was approved by the Legislative Assembly in 1951, for commencement with effect from the 1st April, 1951, provides for a total expenditure of approximately £77½ million. This total is to be spent in the period 1951–56 in the following proportions:

- Economic and Productive Services: 19%
- Communications: 32%
- Social Services: 32%
- Common Services: 17%

In the first three years just under £33 million was spent. The approximate estimated expenditure under some of the more important heads during the first Plan are as follows:

- Agriculture: £5,500,000
- Electricity: £1,750,000
- Urban Water Supplies: £3,000,000
- Rural Water Supplies: £2,100,000
- Roads: £15,600,000
- Railways: £7,700,000
- Posts and Telecommunications: £1,600,000
- Education: £12,700,000
- Medical: £5,400,000
- Housing: £5,800,000
- Offices, Staff Quarters, etc.: £6,300,000

Grants of approximately £4,000,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and £500,000 from the Foreign Operations Administration are being received. The Plan is kept under constant review by the Standing Development Committee of the Cabinet.

Other Development

Outside the scope of the Development Plan the two main items are the Volta River Project and the construction of a new modern port at Tema, 17 miles to the east of Accra. The former is a multi-purpose development scheme involving the harnessing of the River Volta to produce cheap hydro-electric power; the exploitation of the extensive bauxite deposits for the production of aluminium; the construction of the necessary road and rail communications to carry the bauxite to the smelter and the aluminium to the port; and possibly the provision of a country-wide electrical grid and the irrigation of the Accra Plains. It is envisaged that the scheme would be carried...
out as a joint operation by the Gold Coast and British Governments, and by Aluminium Limited and the British Aluminium Company. The public utilities in connexion with the scheme would be provided by the Gold Coast Government. The aluminium companies would be responsible for the bauxite mines and the aluminium smelter. Active investigations into the feasibility of the scheme have been proceeding since 1949 and at the end of 1952 the Gold Coast Government in consultation with Her Majesty's Government decided to set up a Preparatory Commission which would complete the investigations necessary to bring the scheme to its final form. The Preparatory Commission was set up in April 1953 and hopes to produce its report during 1955.

The Gold Coast is short of adequate port facilities, particularly on the eastern seaboard. The construction of a new harbour near Accra, with road and rail links to the existing network, was begun in 1952. The first phase, involving the provision of four deep water berths, is estimated to cost over £10 million and will, in addition to normal traffic, meet the needs of the aluminium industry when required. The access railway from Accra was officially opened on the 11th May, 1954.

Education

In January 1953 there were in the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories, excluding Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, 3,597 Primary and Middle schools with an enrolment of 423,604 (301,257 boys and 122,347 girls) and 55 Secondary schools (including one secondary technical school) with an enrolment of 8,155 (7,066 boys and 1,089 girls). Post-middle technical institutions had an enrolment of 795 (697 boys and 98 girls) and 2,642 students were in teacher-training colleges (1,858 men and 784 women).

Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship had at the same date 403 primary and middle schools with an enrolment of 44,514 (29,077 boys and 15,437 girls); there were four secondary schools with an enrolment of 339, all boys. Three teacher-training colleges had between them 297 students (250 men and 47 women).

The University College of the Gold Coast is entirely residential. It provides training for London degrees in Arts, Theology, Science, Economics and Agriculture. For this purpose it maintains Departments each under a Professor or Senior Lecturer in English, Classics, Geography, History, Mathematics, Economics, Theology, Philosophy, Sociology, Phonetics, French Studies, Archaeology, Botany, Chemistry, Physics, Zoology, Geology and Agriculture, together with an Institute of Education and a National Museum.

Under a separate grant from Government, it administers a Department of Extramural Studies.

The number of undergraduates in residence is 450. These have been accommodated temporarily in buildings at Achimota while the College's Halls of Residence are under construction at Legon.

There is a College of Technology, Arts and Science in Kumasi with an enrolment of 885 students in residence. This College offers courses in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and courses in Accountancy, Surveying, Building, Secretaryship and Administration, Pharmacy and Agriculture. It has a Department of Teacher-Training which provides a two-year post-secondary Teacher-Training course as well as specialist courses in Art and Crafts, Housecraft, Music and Physical Education. In addition the College gives two-year courses leading to the Cambridge University Higher School Certificate Examination in Arts and Science and the London University Intermediate Arts and Science Examinations.

Students and trainees from the Gold Coast and Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship who were in the United Kingdom and Ireland on the 1st January, 1954 numbered 854. Of these 237 held Government scholarships, 27 held other scholarships, 105 were trainees on the Government artisan training scheme, and 485 were private students. In addition there were 121 students in the United States of America and a few in other countries.

At the end of December, 1953, just over 22,000 learners had passed the literacy test during the year and been awarded a Gold Coast Literacy Certificate. 4,709 literacy classes had been established in 2,012 towns and villages.

The comparative figures in respect of expenditure on education are as follows:

| Year | Amount (£) |
|------|-----------|
| 1927 | 146,728   |
| 1937 | 290,553   |

* Including Ordinary, Extraordinary, and Development Expenditure and higher education.

Libraries and Museums

The Gold Coast Government has entrusted to the University College of the Gold Coast the formation and development of a National Museum, the scope of which is provisionally defined as the achievements of man in Africa. The Professor of Archaeology (whose post was established in 1951) is Director of the National Museum, and the Department of Archaeology functions as its Research Branch, undertaking surveys and excavation in the Gold Coast as well as collecting antiquities and ethnological specimens. The collections are now housed and in part exhibited by the Department at Legon, in a building which is to retain a small museum for research and teaching. A public Gallery is to be constructed in Accra in 1955.

The Gold Coast Library Board, a statutory body established in 1950, provides public library services over the whole country. There is a Central Library in Accra, a Regional Library in Kumasi serving Ashanti and the Northern Territories, and branch libraries in Cape Coast, Sekondi, Tamale, Ho and Kpandu. Lending and reference libraries, postal services, book box services, mobile libraries and children's libraries are provided. The book stock numbers 107,000 volumes.

Health

The principal diseases treated in 1953 included malaria, pneumonia, helminthic diseases, rheumatic conditions, affections of the respiratory system, nutritional diseases, skin diseases, diseases of the eye and annexa, and diseases of the digestive system. There are four central hospitals (Government) with specialist facilities, in addition to 27 Government, 11 Mines, 8 Mission and 10 private hospitals with a total of 2,632 beds and 378 cots. The number of beds is distributed as follows:—Government 1,755, Mines 462,
Mission 238, Private 177. These hospitals are supplemented by 18 Government and 102 non-Government dressing stations in rural areas. Three Government health centres have been completed and are functioning. In 1953 there were 61,824 in-patients and 1,178,837 out-patients in the Government hospitals alone.

There are three Schools of Hygiene (Accra, Tamale and Kintampo) for the training of Health Inspectors and Superintendents. The Medical Field Units organization makes surveys and initiates mass treatment of trypanosomiasis and yaws, is experimenting with antrypil in mass treatment of onchocerciasis and undertakes enquiries into the incidence of other endemic diseases, such as guinea-worm, bilharzia, leprosy, malaria, etc.

Estimated expenditure on medical and health services for 1953-54 was £3,317,121, including £1,470,321 for development projects. This figure may be compared with £298,810 in 1935-36, and £281,935 in 1925-26.

Communications

The International Airport at Accra is linked with the other international airports of Kano and Lagos in Nigeria, Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo, Roberts Field in Liberia and Abidjan and Lome in French West Africa by direct air routes.

This airport also serves the following international trunk routes:

- British Overseas Airways Corporation—United Kingdom.
- Pan American World Airways—New York/Johannesburg.
- Air France and Union Aero Maritime Transport—French West Africa.

In addition to the international airport at Accra, internal aerodromes are provided at Takoradi, Kumasi and Tamale. These aerodromes are linked with the capital by internal services operated by the West Africa Airways Corporation.

The total railway mileage open to traffic on 31st March, 1954, was 533 and the track mileage was 641. The main line runs from Takoradi to Kumasi, thence to Accra, a distance of 357 miles; with branches: Takoradi Junction to Sekondi (3 miles), Tarkwa to Prestea (18 miles), Aboso to Cinnamon Bippo (2 miles), Huni Valley to Kade (99 miles Central Province line) and Dunkwa to Awaso (46 miles). The main line and branches are 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. 4,672,143 passengers were carried during the financial year 1953-54 and 1,833,006 tons of freight.

There are 3,671 miles of roads maintained by the Public Works Department; bituminous surface 1,100 miles. In addition a considerable mileage is maintained by Regional Organizations, Local Authorities and timber firms.

The chief port is Takoradi; there are smaller "surf" ports at Accra, Winneba, Cape Coast and Keta. During 1953, 7,830,000 net registered tons of shipping entered and cleared at all ports, of which 6,610,956 tons were handled at Takoradi.

Broadcasting

The Gold Coast broadcasting service run by the Government operates from Accra on two transmitters rated respectively at 1·3 kW. and 5 kW. Twenty-seven relay stations carry the Accra and B.B.C. services to 16,706 subscribers throughout the country. There are in addition 4,034 licence holders.

Principal Occupations

A large proportion of the population is engaged in agriculture, primarily cocoa and subsistence farming. Returns rendered by employers which, however, cover only a part of the working population, show the numbers in the main occupations to be: agriculture, forestry and fishing, 25,073; mining and quarrying, 41,037; manufacturing, 11,776; construction, 44,700; electricity, gas, water and sanitary services, 4,241; commerce, 23,498; transport, storage, communications, 18,311; Services, 47,439. Of the total of these figures, employment by Public Authorities accounted for 92,645.

There were 75 registered trade unions as at 31st December, 1953, of which 66 had submitted returns as at 31st March, 1954, showing a total of 41,231 paid-up members.

Main Crops and Products

Almost all agricultural production in the Gold Coast is carried out by peasant farmers, sometimes organized as communal groups. Modifications in the traditional pattern of agriculture are gradually taking place, partly as a result of experiments and extension work by the Department of Agriculture and partly as a result of economic changes in the country.

In recent years rather more than one-third of the world's supplies of cocoa have come from the Gold Coast which is the largest single producer. Within the Gold Coast cocoa is the basis of the national economy; since World War II, exports of cocoa beans have averaged a little under 70% of the total value of domestic exports and about 92% of agricultural exports. Apart from a relatively small amount which is processed in a local factory, all cocoa produced is exported as prepared beans. Production is entirely in the hands of individual agriculturists whose plantations are mostly very small.

The main food crops are millet, maize, guinea-corn, plantain, yams, cassava, cocoyam, ground-nuts, cowpeas and rice.

Other relatively important agricultural products are palm oil and palm kernels, kola-nuts, coconut oil, copra and coconuts, and shea butter. Minor crops include rubber, coffee, bananas, cotton and fibres.

Palm oil and palm kernels were the most important agricultural exports of the Gold Coast until the rapid expansion of the cocoa industry supplanted them. There is a very considerable internal trade in pericarp and kernel oils; the oils are extracted by hand, and consumed over a wide area. They are also used for soap-making on a cottage-industry scale.

Livestock number:—cattle 430,160; sheep 464,320; goats 427,629; pigs 57,984; horses 5,836; poultry 2,525,862; donkeys 16,814.

During 1953 local production of livestock for slaughter numbered:—cattle 26,085; sheep 60,051; goats 55,582; pigs 5,717. This stock did not meet the needs of the country as regards meat and 64,514 head of cattle, 139,140 sheep, 105,233 goats and 306 pigs were imported.
Timber exports in 1953 totalled 10,388,134 cubic feet of logs, 4,623,788 cubic feet of lumber and 141,469 cubic feet of plywood and veneers.

Sea fisheries are a major source of food, contributing some 20,000 tons in a normal year. The fishermen, of whom there are about 50,000, work from dugout canoes. Species comprised in the catch include sardineellas, Caranx, tunny, shark, snapper, breams, drums, and threadfins. The catch is preserved for inland distribution chiefly by smoking and by salting and sun-drying. Fishing is also pursued in the rivers, particularly in the Volta and its tributaries. The catch is much smaller than that from the sea, but it is of value to inland districts.

Development of the industry is being sought through the introduction of motor fishing vessels, and of canning and dehydration for preserving fish.

Gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite are mined.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are two Marketing Boards, one dealing with cocoa and the other to handle scheduled agricultural produce. The produce at present on the schedule consists of oil palm produce, copra and coconut oil, shea nuts and shea butter, coffee and groundnuts. These Boards ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to the producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, pay a reasonable remuneration to buying agents, spend money on research, and finance schemes for the benefit of the people in the producing areas. World prices for these products are high at present; but both Boards have stabilization funds which would supplement the price to the producer should world prices decline.

At the 31st March, 1953, there were 424 registered primary co-operative societies with 38,000 members. The total distributable surplus for the year was £182,000. Savings and deposits amounted to £62,000, and capital and reserves to £483,000. The Co-operative Marketing Association marketed 28,000 tons of cocoa (13% of the crop) in 1951–52, 47,000 tons (19% of the crop) in 1952–53, and 40,400 tons (19·6% of the crop) during the 1953–54 main-crop season.
