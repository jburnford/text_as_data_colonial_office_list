Principal Towns

The capital is Kingston, which, together with Port Royal, has an estimated population of 142,464. The other principal towns are:

- Montego Bay: 11,547
- Spanish Town: 12,007

History

The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted for over a century and a half. When the riches of Mexico and Peru were opened up by the conquistadores, the Spaniards flocked to the mainland from the island colonies and Jamaica became little more than a supply base for expeditions to the mainland of America. The population, which had never been very great, dwindled to an insignificant and impoverished community which offered little resistance to the English invasion under Admiral Penn and General Venables in 1655. With this date the modern history of the Jamaican people may be said to begin. The last attempt to recover the island for Spain collapsed and the last remnant of the Spaniards left Jamaica from Runaway Bay in 1660. The Spaniards had imported slaves from Africa, most of whom they took with them, but a small number remained in the mountains of the interior and formed the nucleus of the Maroons. Of the present community, the founders and pioneers were colonists who came from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the seventeenth century.

Constitution

On the 5th May, 1953, the Constitution granted in 1944 was extended by the Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council, 1953, the principal features of which provide for:

1. The appointment of a Chief Minister and seven Ministers charged with the responsibility of Government Departments by the Governor on the recommendation of the Chief Minister;
2. The replacement of five elected members in Executive Council by eight Ministers thereby ensuring a majority of the elected element in that body.

The present constitution provides for a Privy Council, an Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

The Privy Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary and two nominated unofficial members. It advises the Governor in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government service and in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy.

The Executive Council is presided over by the Governor and consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, two unofficial nominated members from the Legislative Council and eight Ministers.

The Legislature consists of two Houses, the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives.

The Legislative Council consists of three ex officio members, not more than two official members and not less than ten unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The Council elects one of its unofficial members who is not a member of the Executive Council to be its President.

The House of Representatives consists of 32 members elected by adult suffrage from constituencies into which the Island is divided. At its first meeting the House elects one of its members to be Speaker. The Chief Minister and seven Ministers are appointed by the Governor from among its members. In the case of the Chief Minister, the name of the person whom it is proposed to appoint is submitted to the House for approval before appointment is made. The seven Ministers are appointed on the recommendation of the Chief Minister.

Land Policy

Appreciable areas of Government-owned lands, with the exception of Forest Reserves, have been disposed of under the existing Land Settlement Scheme, which is a freehold system of tenure. However, in recent years, experiments have been carried out under a leasehold scheme. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation

The main heads of direct taxation are: Income tax, land and property tax, death duties—namely, (a) estate, (b) legacy and (c) succession duties—and the licence duty on motor vehicles.
and on other personal properties. Taxes on real properties are collected on the basis of the improved value. This is defined as the actual present gross value of the property.

Indirect taxation comprises Customs duties, excise duties, entertainment duty and certain licences and fees. Essential foodstuffs are either free of Customs duty or at low rates. Several industries are granted duty-free admission of building materials, plant and equipment.

### Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39 | 2,840,142  | 2,854,021       |
| 1949–50 | 10,002,635 | 9,890,329       |
| 1950–51 | 10,938,887 | 10,342,339      |
| 1951–52 | 13,798,426 | 14,346,654      |
| 1952–53 | 13,925,378 | 14,153,346      |
| 1953–54*| 14,942,218 | 15,094,373      |

* Revised Estimates.

It was estimated that in 1953–54 £8,176,000 of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and £3,235,500 from direct taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were estimated to be:

- Administration, Law and Justice: £3,106,031
- Communications and Public Works: £2,916,928
- Education: £1,861,449
- Public Health: £1,896,726
- Social Welfare: £1,458,169

The substantial deficits in 1951–52, 1952–53 and 1953–54 have resulted largely from rehabilitation expenditure following the hurricane of 1951. The revenues for 1951–52 and 1952–53 include receipts of approximately £1,000,000 in each year in respect of hurricane rehabilitation assistance received from Her Majesty's Government. In addition, receipts from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds totalled £669,000 in 1951–52, £696,000 in 1952–53 and £663,000 in 1953–54.

A Loan of £3,500,000 was successfully raised on the London money market in early 1953 and the Public Debt now stands at £17,700,000 with Sinking Funds amounting to approximately £3,500,000.

### Development Plans

The Development Plan launched under the stimulus of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 is nearing completion and a plan for the period 1955–60, based on the recommendations of the International Bank Mission's Report, has been prepared.

### Currency

British silver and cupro-nickel coins of all denominations circulate freely. Nickel and bronze alloy subsidiary coinage of 1d., ½d., and ¼d. denominations are in circulation. Jamaica Government currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1954, amounted to £4,764,687.

### Education

The University College of the West Indies, at Mona, near Kingston, has faculties of Arts, Science, Medicine and Education. In the 1953–54 session there were 301 students. Technical education is available at the Kingston Technical School which had 528 students in 1953. The Government awarded nine scholarships for higher education in 1953, tenable at the University College of the West Indies or in the United Kingdom or Canada. There were 52 Jamaicans with scholarships at Universities in the United Kingdom, three in Canada and one in the U.S.A. In addition there were 672 private Jamaican students out of which 434 are student nurses. There is no reliable estimate of the number of private students in North America. In 1953 there were 27 secondary schools with an enrolment of 7,917 and 714 primary schools with an enrolment of 218,513.

Expenditure on educational services in 1953 was £2,448,061 of which about £43,995 was contributed by the United Kingdom. In 1935 the expenditure was £226,392.

### Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Institute of Jamaica, a cultural centre of the Island, includes a general Lending Library, a West India Reference Library and a Museum. The Museum contains a comprehensive survey of exhibits dealing with geology and plant and animal life.

### Health

During 1953 the Government spent approximately £1,628,102 on its medical services, which are organized on an island-wide basis. This figure excludes the cost of maintenance and the construction of buildings. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £191,207.

Disease rates compare favourably with more advanced countries nearby, e.g. the United States of America and Canada. Among the colony's main diseases are: helminthiasis, yaws, malaria, venereal diseases and pulmonary tuberculosis. The island has recently suffered outbreaks of poliomyelitis and typhoid fever, the first epidemics for many years.

Each of the Island's 14 parishes has a full-time Medical Officer (Health), in charge of public health services, and a staff of sanitary inspectors, public health and district nurses. In the head office in Kingston are specialist officers who are responsible for the various phases of public health activities, which include epidemiology, health education, quarantine, public health nursing and control work in tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws and malaria. There are four mobile health units which carry on a generalized public health programme in different areas.

The following are the government hospitals in Jamaica:

- 21 general hospitals (2,440 beds).
- Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital (110 beds and 100 cribs).
- George V Memorial Sanatorium for chest diseases (220 beds).
- Tuberculosis Hospital (180 beds).
- Mental Hospital (2,600 beds).
- Hansen Home for the treatment of leprosy (188 beds).

There are altogether 129 hospital outstations and dispensaries. The figure for out-patient attendance during 1953 was approximately 540,714.

The University College Hospital of the West Indies was opened in 1952 and provides accommodation for 290 in-patients. Eventual accommodation for 500 beds is planned. There are large Casualty and Out-patient Clinics.
Communications

The international airports are at Palisadoes and Montego Bay and there are six private air strips. Boscobel was recently completed and is being used by Jamaica Flying Club members and private owners. It is also proposed to utilize this strip in connexion with the operation of internal air services.

Palisadoes Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Trans-Canada Air Lines, Avianca Airlines, Cubana Airlines, Resort Airlines and numerous non-scheduled operators.

Montego Bay Airport is used by B.O.A.C., British West Indian Airways, Pan American World Airways, Avianca Airlines, Delta Chicago and Southern Airlines and Trans-Canada Air Lines, in the tourist season.

Meteorological services are provided by the British Caribbean Meteorological Service, air traffic and associated services by the Civil Aviation Department and aeronautical telecommunications facilities by International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited.

The Jamaica Government Railway has 207½ miles of railway line. The main routes are:

(a) Kingston—Montego Bay.
(b) Kingston—Port Antonio.
(c) Kingston—Frankfield
(d) Kingston—Linstead.

During the financial year 1953–54, the railway carried 1,052,591 passengers who paid £126,685 7s. 6d., and 570,165 tons of freight from which £385,544 was earned. Over two miles of track have been laid in connexion with the operations of the bauxite companies now operating in Jamaica.

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring; the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the Island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum gradients are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,615 miles of main roads, of which 831 miles are asphalted, the remainder being of waterbound macadamized surface; and about 4,438 miles of parochial roads, of which approximately 2,137 miles are suitable for motor traffic.

The principal ports are Kingston, Montego Bay and Port Antonio. Regular cargo and passenger services are maintained with the United Kingdom by Messrs. Elders and Fyffes, the Jamaica Banana Producers' Association, the Royal Mail Lines, the Harrison Lines and the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique; with Canada by the Canadian National Steamship Company and Saguenay Terminals Limited; with the United States of America by the United Fruit Company and the Alcoa Steamship Company. Bulk cargoes of petroleum products are imported from Trinidad and Aruba. There was a total importation of 643,570-34 tons of cargo during 1953–54 and exportation of 1,286,803-56 tons. The total export through the Port of Kingston was 289,913-44 tons, and total importation was 624,435-86 tons.

Broadcasting

The Jamaica Broadcasting Company Limited operates a commercial broadcasting service for the Island using short and medium wave with a power of 5,000 watts. The Company also operates a wired rediffusion service in urban and suburban Kingston. At the end of July 1954 there were approximately 5,000 subscribers. It is estimated that the radio audience is approximately 235,000. Ten per cent. of the Company's time is used by the Government of Jamaica and the Company relays several hours per week from the B.B.C.

Principal Occupations

In 1943 the gainfully employed population was 505,092, the numbers in some occupational groups being:

| Occupation                  | Numbers |
|----------------------------|---------|

| Transport                  | 11,429  |

Aided by the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Law, the industrial development of the Island has continued. At the end of 1953 the number of registered factories was 715 employing 25,995 persons. As at 31st July, 1952, there were 13 registered trade unions with a total membership of 89,736, and by 1953 the number had increased to 15, with a membership of 93,627. The largest, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union, had an approximate membership of 69,692 on 31st March, 1953.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar cane, bananas, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, pimento, citrus, rice and maize. In 1953 3,134,000 tons sugar cane and 13¼ million 24-lb. bunches of bananas were produced.

Products and manufactures include sugar, cornmeal, condensed milk, margarine, butterine, lard, rum, beer, cigarettes, matches; 533,000,000 cigarettes were made in 1953.

Minerals won are bauxite, quantities of which are exported for processing, and gypsum.

Tourist Trade

The value of tourist trade in 1952 was estimated to be £4,249,172 and had increased in 1953 by 14·4% to £4,860,135.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The major export crops are handled by the following marketing organizations:

- The Marketing Department (formerly the Department of Commerce and Industries).
- The Coffee Industry Board.
- The Cocoa Marketing Board.
- The Sugar Manufacturers’ Association (of Jamaica) Limited;
- The Citrus Growers’ Association.
- The Banana Board.

Under the Coffee Industry Regulation Law (Law 43 of 1948) and the Cocoa Marketing Law (Law 40 of 1951), the Coffee Industry Board and the Cocoa Marketing Board were appointed on the 6th December, 1948 and 13th December, 1951 respectively. These Boards are given wide statutory powers to regulate and develop these industries.

The Exports Division of the Marketing Department is the sole exporter of pimento, coffee and cocoa (the last two on behalf of the Coffee Industry and Cocoa Marketing Boards) except for the Blue Mountain type coffee, which is handled by a group of pre-war dealers.

The Sugar Manufacturers’ Association (comprising all the sugar manufacturers in Jamaica) provides the liaison between the sugar industry, the Government of Jamaica, and overseas interests. It deals with all aspects of the sugar industry, and sells co-operatively sugar for local consumption and all rum and other by-products.

As far as exports are concerned, during the war and up to 1952 when the British Ministry of Food purchased the entire exportable surplus, the Sugar Manufacturers’ Association acted for the entire industry. The position now is that under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21st December, 1951, Jamaica is entitled from this year onwards, to a Global quota, divided into a Negotiated Price Quota and a Free Quota. The former is sold to the Ministry of Food at annually negotiated prices, and the latter is disposed of through commercial channels, as in the years before the war.

Through its subsidiaries, the Sugar Manufacturers’ Association maintains substantial interests in firms engaged in the manufacture of commodities ancillary to the sugar industry, e.g.:

- Wholly owned subsidiaries—Jamaica Carbonics, Ltd.; Anhydrous Alcohol, Ltd.
- Partly owned subsidiary—Jamaica Oxygen and Acetylene, Ltd.

The Citrus Growers’ Association has full responsibility for the industry, and is the sole exporter of citrus, which is marketed co-operatively for its members. It operates a processing plant and packing house, which, together with independent processors and packers, obtain quotas of fresh fruits for packing and canning. These arrangements do not include limes, lemons and ugils.

The Banana Board was appointed on 1st October, 1953 under the Banana Board Law (Law 24 of 1953). The Board is the sole exporter of bananas and has wide powers over the industry.

On the 31st December, 1953, there were 118 Co-operative societies with 14,115 members, and total Share Capital of £152,822 registered under the Co-operative Societies Law. Of these, 55 were Credit Societies operating principally in the urban areas; 3 were Agricultural Credit Societies operating in the rural areas amongst farmers; 21 were Consumer Societies; 27 were Producers’, Marketing and Processing Societies; 4 were Transport and Tillage Societies; 2 were Co-operative Farming Societies; 1 was a Housing Society; 1 was a Cattle Insurance Society; 1 was a Land Lease Society; and 3 were Central Societies, 1 for Credit Societies in urban areas and the other 2 for Marketing Societies.
The Credit Societies made loans amounting to £150,648 and recovered £107,523 during the year. The value of goods sold in Consumer Societies was £88,759 and the value of produce marketed through Marketing Societies was £95,656.
