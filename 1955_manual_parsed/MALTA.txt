MALTA

Area
The total area is 122 square miles made up of the three main islands as follows: Malta 94·876 square miles, Gozo 25·899 square miles and Comino about one square mile. Filfia and Cominotto are mere islets.

Population
On 31st December, 1953, the population, which is European, was estimated at 320,613, divided as follows: Malta 292,285, Gozo and Comino 28,328. Malta is overpopulated, and it is the policy of the Government to encourage and assist emigration. From 1946 to 1953 over 35,000 persons emigrated; the figure for 1954 was over 11,500, of whom 8,400 went to Australia. The United Kingdom Government has undertaken to meet two-thirds of expenditure on emigration for the period 1953–57, up to a maximum of £200,000 in any one year.
Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1953 was 41.3° recorded on the 14th January, while the highest, 95.3° occurred on the 31st July. The mean annual temperature is 66° and the mean annual rainfall is 17 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the scirocco wind which blows from the south-east.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12th July, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War, and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

Constitution

Letters Patent granting self-government to the Island came into force in 1947. They provide for a Legislative Assembly of forty members, elected by universal suffrage by proportional representa-
tion. The Legislative Assembly passes Bills for "the peace, order and good government of Malta", subject to certain limitations regarding "reserved matters". The Ministry consists of the Prime Minister and not more than seven other Ministers. The Executive Council consists of the Cabinet presided over by the Governor. Legisla-
tive and administrative powers in regard to defence and various matters related or incidental to defence and external relations, are reserved to the Governor, advised by the Nominated Council, which consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legal Secretary and three officers (one each from the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force). The Privy Council consists of the Executive Council and the Nominated Council sitting together, and affords an opportunity for joint consultation in matters in which action proposed to be taken by one side of the dyarchy may affect the other side.

The English language and the Maltese language are the official languages of Malta.

Land Policy

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese, but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

Taxation

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, enter-
tainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties, and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £200.
- 3s. for every pound of the next £300.
- 4s. 6d. for every pound of the next £400.
- 6s. 6d. for every pound of the remainder.

The tax on companies is at the rate of 5s. on every pound of the chargeable income.

A surtax is also levied on incomes exceeding £2,500 at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £500.
- 2s. 6d. for every pound of the next £500.
- 3s. for every pound of the next £500.
- 3s. 6d. for every pound of the remainder.

Interest at 2½% is paid by the Government on £79,081 outstanding balance on 31st March, 1938, of the debt known as “Massa Frumentaria” incurred by the Municipality of Valletta under the Government of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, in connexion with the monopoly of the wheat trade. The funds of the “Massa Frumentaria” were in 1798 appropriated by the French Government then in occupation of the Island.

By the Temporary Borrowing Act, 1951, the Government was enabled to borrow an amount up to a maximum of £500,000 by way of an overdraft on the Public Account in order to meet the cost of consignments of wheat and other essential commodities imported by the Government. The Act, which provided for the repayment of any sum borrowed not later than 31st March, 1953, has now lapsed.

Under the Malta Treasury Bills Act, 1952, the Government may, whenever authorized by Resolution of the Legislative Assembly, raise money not exceeding the amount specified in such Resolution by means of three months’ Treasury Bills. On 23rd September, 1953, the amount so raised was £350,000.

Currency

The currency of Malta consists of notes of 20s. and 10s., issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, together with British coins, including silver, cupro-nickel and bronze coins, and local notes in denominations of 5s., 2s. 6d., 2s. and 1s. Bank of England notes ceased to be legal tender in the Island in 1949. Maltese £1 and 10s. notes are on a par with sterling, and £ for £ coverage is maintained at the Bank of England. The amount of local currency in circulation on 31st March, 1954, was £16,757,882.

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Elementary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 112 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction, with an enrolment of 42,623 pupils, and six Secondary schools (one of them preparatory) with 1,837 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded in 1769, has an average attendance of 300 students and grants degrees in divinity, law, medicine, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts and science.

Communications

The commercial airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station, but there are other airfields at Hal Far and Ta Qali. British European Airways operate the following services:—(a) a daily service to and from the Island to the United Kingdom, stopping at Rome and/or Naples; (b) a twice-weekly service to Sicily (Catania); (c) a service to Tripoli, Benghazi and Cairo twice a week.

The size of the Island does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Five miles of road have so far been surfaced with sheet asphalt and 355 miles with full grouting, semi-grouting and surface asphalt dressing.

The chief port is the Grand Harbour, which in 1953 handled 1,741 steamships of a total tonnage of 2,592,542 and 177 sailing vessels with a total of 13,914 tons. There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. A twice-weekly service to Syracuse is operated by the Star of Malta, a locally registered vessel. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a service calling at Naples, Messina, Catania, Syracuse, Malta, Tripoli, every five days. A ferry service running between Marfa and Mgarr links the two Islands of Malta and Gozo.

Broadcasting

There are no broadcasting stations in Malta. The number of wireless receiving sets on 30th September, 1954, was, however, 12,510. Messrs. Broadcast Relay Service (Malta) Limited operate a rediffusion station situated at Hamrun. The number of rediffusion subscribers is 33,032.

During 1953 19,669 cwts. of fish were landed by local fishermen (mainly during the months between May and November) with a wholesale value of £135,855.

There are no known mineral resources in Malta and raw materials have nearly all to be imported.

There are no heavy industries in the islands, but a growing number of light industries produce flour, flour-paste, tomato-paste, beer, wine, aerated waters, cigarettes, smokers' pipes, matches, shirts, footwear, handbags, furniture, cement, tiles, marble works, bitumen, basketware, soap, candles, crown corks, gloves, mirrors, homespun cloth, buttons and tanned leather; lace and homespun are village industries.

The marketing of agricultural produce is controlled by the Government Department of Agriculture. Vegetables and fruits are sold at six marketing centres through farmers' co-operative societies and "Pitkali". The former charge a commission of 8½%, the latter 10%, of which 3½% is passed to the Government to meet the expenses in connexion with marketing control.
