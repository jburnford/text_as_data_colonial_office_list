SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE

Area
The Protectorate extends along part of the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden and is 68,000 square miles in area.

Population
No complete census has yet been possible but the mainly nomadic Somali population is estimated to be 640,000. The non-indigenous element of the population is small. It consists of European and Indian officials of the Government, one or two European representatives of commercial houses in Aden and a few Indian and Arab traders.

Geographical Features
The country consists of four main features—the coastal plain, the maritime plain (both known as the Guan), the escarpment, rising in parts to 6,000 and 7,000 feet (the Golis), and a gently sloping plain or plateau to the south (the Ogo). The Haud, the empty waterless plains, the greater part of which lie to the south of the Protectorate frontier, constitute the principal pastures of the country.

Climate
Except for the intense heat of the coast with an irritating dust-laden wind, which also occurs in a few inland areas during the south-west monsoon from May to September, the climate is healthy and pleasant. The temperature varies from 70°–108° in the coastal areas, and in the highlands from occasional slight local frosts (32°) to between 80° and 99°. The rainfall varies from an average of 2 inches at Berbera on the coast, 5 inches at Burao, 15 inches at Hargeisa, to as much as 50 inches in the higher mountains of Erigavo and Borama Districts.

Principal Towns
The capital is Hargeisa—population about 20,000; Burao has about 4,000, Berbera, the principal port, about 7,500. The population of these towns varies considerably at different times of the year.

History
When the Egyptian garrisons were withdrawn in 1884 a British Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somaliland coast from Zeila to Berbera. By 1887 a series of treaties guaranteeing British protection had been concluded with various Somali tribes and in the following year the limits of the British and French spheres of influence were defined. The other inland boundaries of the Protectorate were defined by agreements with Italy in 1894 and Ethiopia in 1897.

Until 1898 the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the Foreign Office and in 1905 to the Colonial Office.

From 1901 until 1920 the Government was engaged in sporadic operations against the Mullah, Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. In 1910 the Government withdrew to the coast for three years but it was not until 1920 that the Mullah's power was finally broken.

In August 1940 Italian Forces from Ethiopia invaded and occupied the Protectorate but in March 1941 the British Forces drove out the Italians and a Military Government was established. The Protectorate remained under military administration until 1948 when the Civil Government was reconstituted.

Constitution
The constitution is based on the Somaliland Order in Council, 1929. There is no Executive or Legislative Council and the power to make Ordinances is vested in the Governor. A Protectorate Advisory Council, consisting both of elected and of selected Somali representatives of all sections of the people, was established in 1947; there is also a non-statutory Governor's Council of official members. Local Government Councils with executive powers have been established for the two principal towns of Hargeisa and Berbera.

Land Policy
Government recognizes, or grants, individual title to land only in the towns. Apart from a small number of old freehold and waqf* titles, land in the towns is held on lease from the Government. Outside the towns there is no alienation of land.

Taxation
The principal form of taxation is indirect, i.e. Customs import and export duties, which in the financial year 1953–54 yielded 76·9% of the total ordinary revenue. There is no income tax or any form of direct taxation save a house tax payable by owners or occupiers of property, which is assessed at 10% of the annual rental value of the property. In addition, a municipal sales tax, or octroi, exists on certain commodities, e.g. livestock and cereals brought for sale into specific townships.

* Includes revenue and expenditure in respect of Currency Conversion Loan: £102,750 and £113,290 respectively in 1951–52; £113,290 and £102,750 in 1952–53.

† Includes revenue and expenditure of £3,878 in respect of Army Works Services.

It was estimated that in 1954–55 some £392,320 of the entire local revenue would be derived from Customs and Excise duties. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were estimated at:

- Public Works: £332,605
- Social Services: £186,323
- Administration: £177,456
- Development: £177,355

There is no Public Debt of the Protectorate apart from the liability to repay loans-in-aid amounting to £236,000 received from the United Kingdom during the years 1921–34, should circumstances permit.

Currency

The currency in circulation is the East African currency issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The rupee currency of India, which was legal tender until 31st October, 1951, was withdrawn in that year. The East African currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

The Protectorate received an allocation of £857,232 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, 1940 and 1945. The territory, being substantially grant-aided, cannot provide additional development funds from its own resources or by raising loans. This sum has been distributed as follows:

- Basic Services: £352,802
- Social Services: £196,445
- Productive Services: £267,620
- Reserve: £40,365

Other Development

A Somaliland subsidiary of an American Oil Company has for some time been engaged on a geological survey and a further company has recently commenced survey work in another area of the Protectorate. Both firms are operating under exploration licences.

Education

Expenditure on education in 1935–36 was £500 whilst the estimate for 1953–54 is over £52,000. There are now 45 grant-aided private schools and Koranic schools (1,480 pupils in 1953). There are also 16 Government elementary schools including a girls’ school opened in 1953 (1,050 pupils in 1953) and two Intermediate Boarding Schools (326 pupils in 1953). There is also a Vocational Training Centre for 40 pupils, a Trades School for 70 boys and a small Secondary School to take a maximum of 60 boys which was opened in 1953. Twenty-three boys were maintained in Secondary Schools and Technical Colleges outside the Protectorate and 18 Somalis have been sent for further education in the United Kingdom and the Sudan. There are small Government schools for European and Indian children. Since there are no missions operating in the Protectorate there are no mission schools.

Libraries, etc.

There is in Hargeisa a “Secretariat Library” (predominantly non-fiction) which is open to members of the public as well as to Government officials. There are also ten Government reading rooms (with public listening radio sets installed) in the main towns and settlements.

Health

Expenditure on medical and health services in 1935–36 was £11,000. The estimate for 1953–54 is £93,910.

The commoner diseases are tropical ulcer, the respiratory diseases, particularly lobar pneumonia, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, eye complaints and malaria. Malaria is seasonal and its incidence from year to year varies with the rainfall: it sometimes assumes epidemic proportions but its incidence is generally low and no administrative headquarters can be classified as malarious. Preventive measures are largely directed to raising the standards of housing and environmental sanitation in the towns, and to education of the people in the avoidance of disease. Malaria control by residual spraying is being carried out on an increasing scale. Tuberculosis control measures are largely dependent on treatment of infectious cases at present, but a large scale B.C.G. vaccination scheme is receiving active consideration.

There are seven district hospitals, with a total capacity of 600 beds. There is also a Mental Hospital in Berbera with accommodation for 75 patients. The new group hospital in Hargeisa is now in operation and the old hospital is being developed as a Tuberculosis Hospital of 140 beds. There are in addition 13 district dispensaries, manned by locally trained dressers while over 75 Tribal Aids are now living and working amongst the nomads.

During 1953 96,274 persons were treated at hospital out-patients departments and of these 8,649 were admitted. There were 32,675 first attendances at District Dispensaries.
Communications

Regular air services are maintained by Aden Airways between Hargeisa, Berbera and Aden, and with East Africa and Addis Ababa. There are no internal services or railways.

There are approximately 3,000 miles of gravel or earth roads.

A fairly regular weekly steamer service operates between Aden and Berbera. Other sea communications are maintained by dhow. The Brocklebank Line maintains a monthly service from the United Kingdom to Berbera during the months October to April.

Broadcasting

The Government Information Office maintains a broadcasting station known as Radio Somali, which transmits on a wavelength of 7-125 Mc/s for one and a half hours per day. Receiving sets are installed in schools and community centres throughout the Protectorate.

Principal Occupations

Government service and public works provide, in effect, the only source of local employment and numbers of Somali emigrate in search of work. The large majority of the people are nomads with camels, sheep and goats. The growing of crops, though still on a small scale, is increasing. It is estimated that there are some 12,000 small farms in the country, most of them less than ten acres in extent.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are millet, hides, skins, gum and guano. A rough estimate of the livestock population is: camels 1,200,000, sheep 2,355,000, goats 1,645,000. There are also some cattle and horses.
