NORTHERN RHODESIA

(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.)

Area

The Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia lies on the plateau of Central Africa. Its area is 288,130 square miles, including 3,000 square miles of inland water.

Population

The population at the census of 8th May, 1951, and estimated population at 31st December, 1953, were as follows:

|                | 1951   | 1953   |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| European       | 37,221 | 50,000 |
| Asian          | 2,529  | 5,000  |
| "Coloured"     | 1,092  | 1,500  |
| African        | 1,770,000 | 1,960,000 |
| Total          | 1,810,842 | 2,016,500 |

Geographical Features

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000-5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 703 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate

There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°-100°, but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.

History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. Lacerda, who visited Chief Kasembe's capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in June 1798. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty's Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be, and on 17th October, 1900, the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika's dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy of £850.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed, and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company, but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company's administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company, and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April, 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

Constitution

Government is carried on by a Governor appointed by the Crown, with an Executive Council of nine Ministers, each responsible for a group of Departments, five officials and four unofficials. The Legislative Council consists of twenty-six members, of whom eight are official, twelve are elected Europeans, two are Europeans nominated by the Governor to represent African interests, and four are Africans, nominated by the Governor (who usually nominates those selected by the African Representative Council from among its own members). It is presided over by the Speaker, who is an unofficial but not a member of the Legislative Council.

Land Policy

Land is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land is alienated on leasehold tenure by the Land Board which insists on certain standards of finance and farming skill. There is in certain areas freehold land held by private persons who obtained title in the early days.

Taxation

Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 6s. and 17s. 6d. per annum. There are, in addition, certain levies generally varying between 1s. and 5s. per annum made by Native Authorities.

Income tax, supertax and undistributed profits tax are assessed by the Federal Government. A territorial surcharge may be imposed in addition.

Customs tariffs and excise duties are the main forms of indirect taxation.

Currency

The currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The present denominations are 10s., £1, 5s. and £10 notes, cupro-nickel or copper halfpennies and pennies and cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns. Under the Federation's Coinage and Currency Act, 1954, the Federal Legislature has made provision for coinage and currency in the Federation. Their issue then came under the control of the Central African Currency Board. With effect from 1st January 1955 British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia coins became the only legal tender in the Federal area.

Development Plans

On the introduction of the Federal Constitution it was necessary to distinguish in the Northern Rhodesia Development Plan the responsibilities of the Federal and Territorial Governments. This was done in the 1953 review of the Plan which is now estimated to cost £52 million up to the end of the period in 1956. The division between the Federal and Territorial Governments at 31st December, 1953, was:

| Category          | £       |
|-------------------|---------|
| Federal Government| 16,900,000|
| Territorial Government| 35,100,000|

This sum is derived as follows:

| Category                                      | £       |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| Loans                                         | 9,000,000|
| Colonial Development and Welfare Grant        | 2,778,000|
| Northern Rhodesia and Federation Development Account | 40,222,000|

Total: £52,000,000

It is allocated for expenditure as follows:

Education

Non-African Education and all Higher Education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

There are 29 Government schools, two Government-aided and seven private schools providing education for European children. Seven of the Government schools provide education up to Form V. There are six Government hostels where 361 children board. The enrolment in 1938 in Government schools was 1,048 and in 1953 was 7,812; in Government-aided and private schools it was 200 and 1,346 respectively. Technical training is given in conjunction with correspondence courses. Government assistance in the form of scholarships, bursaries and loans is given to those who proceed to higher education centres outside Northern Rhodesia. There were 105 students in receipt of such assistance in 1953.

At present there are ten Northern Rhodesia European bursary holders studying in the United Kingdom, and 22 in South Africa.

There is one Coloured school, and financial assistance is given to those who cannot attend there to enable them to be educated outside the Territory. Similar assistance is given to Indian children who cannot attend the seven Indian schools.

Of the 340,000 African children of school age some 167,676 were in the following schools in 1953:

| Category                                      | No. of schools | No. of pupils, etc. |

| Other vocational schools (girls)              | 15             | 367                 |

The only post-secondary course within the Territory is for the training of teachers in upper primary schools. Bursaries are awarded for...
students to attend various higher courses outside the Territory: 27 such bursaries were awarded in 1953. A comparison of recurrent expenditure is made below.

Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.

The Institute, with headquarters at Lusaka, has conducted social research in British Central Africa since 1938. Emphasis is placed on the study of the reaction of African peoples to modern social and economic conditions.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia's National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

Public health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

There are eight Government European hospitals in the Territory. During 1953 7,996 patients were admitted, while there were 37,537 attendances at the out-patient department. The principal causes for admission were diseases of the respiratory system, infectious and parasitic diseases (excluding malaria), diseases of the digestive system, and malaria (including undefined malaria).

Approximately 40,362 persons were admitted during 1953 to the African hospitals run by the Government, and there were 498,754 attendances at the out-patient departments. The principal causes of admission were infectious and parasitic diseases (excluding malaria), accidents, malaria, and diseases of the respiratory system.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above, there are 91 Government Rural Health Centres. In 1953 there were approximately 18,000 in-patients, 460,000 out-patients and 1,700,000 out-patient attendances.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for Civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and other aspects of communications.

There is an international airport at Livingstone and national airports at Lusaka, Ndola and Kasama, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. There are 42 other airfields, 19 of which are all-weather. Internal services are operated by Central African Airways. External services are operated by B.O.A.C. and Springbok Airways.

Other external charter services are operated by Hunting and Airwork Air Charter.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo Border (at Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 642 miles. In the year ended 31st March 1953 the railways carried 744,488 passengers, and 3,107,446 short tons of freight.

The total mileage of maintained roads in the Territory is now 18,628, made up as follows:

| Roads Type       | Miles   |
|------------------|---------|
| Main roads       | 4,348   |
| District and Branch roads | 5,443 |
| Ungazetted tracks | 5,531 |
| Town roads       | 109     |
| Rural roads      | 3,197   |

There are 377 miles of main roads of Class 1 (bituminous surface) standard. This total includes roads maintained by the Public Works Department, main roads through townships, and also roads completed but still maintained by Contractors.

The Zambezi River Transport Service Board of Control operates a transport service along the Zambezi River from Livingstone to Mongu. The first portion of the route is covered by rail, and the remainder by road. In 1953 the Service carried 2,439 short tons and 8,524 passengers.

Broadcasting

The Central African Broadcasting Station is situated in Lusaka and broadcasts for seven hours daily to the Africans of the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland. Programmes in English and seven vernaculars are radiated on two transmitters, of 15 kW. and 2½ kW. A licence fee of 30s. is charged to listeners in Southern Rhodesia and licences are issued free of charge in Nyasaland. They are not issued in Northern Rhodesia. It is estimated that approximately 40,000 Africans in the three territories own wireless sets and that at peak listening hours there are 120,000 listeners.

A wired broadcast service, under the control of the Central African Broadcasting Station, has been installed in one of the locations in Lusaka.

The main crops are maize and tobacco. Small quantities of groundnuts, rice, cotton and wheat are also produced.

The approximate livestock population is cattle 972,000, sheep and goats 87,000, and pigs 51,000. During 1953 some 63,500 head of cattle were slaughtered.

Output of sawlogs, poles, and firewood amounted to 1,499,782 tons in 1953.

The chief minerals are copper, zinc, lead, and cobalt. Also produced are vanadium pentoxide, limestone, tin, manganese and gold. Total mineral production in 1953 was valued at nearly £91 million.

A very large variety of products is now being manufactured in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, steel finishing work, tiles, furniture, clothing, beer, mineral waters, soap and oils, metal castings and nuts and bolts.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru, and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is cured and marketed in the urban areas.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

A firmly entrenched co-operative movement exists which includes 15 European Societies having a total turnover in 1953 of £1,813,181. Of these five are marketing and supply societies handling tobacco, wheat and dairy products. Maize is marketed through a marketing board. There are three consumer societies and one agricultural credit society.

Among Africans there are 94 registered co-operative societies; 19 are consumer, and 64 marketing organizations. Between them these had a turnover in 1953 of £345,137. A large proportion of the African-grown maize crop was marketed through these societies, acting as agents or selling direct to the maize marketing board. A strong thrift movement exists consisting of ten societies holding £5,833 in deposits on behalf of their members.
