BRITISH HONDURAS

Area

British Honduras lies on the Caribbean coast of Central America, bounded on the north and part of the west by Mexico and by Guatemala in the remainder of the west and south. Its land area is about 8,866 square miles, which includes a number of islets, known as "cayes", lying off the coast.

Population

The estimate at the end of 1953 was 75,778. The races are now heavily intermixed and although the 1946 Census gave the following racial figures:

- Creoles: 41,053
- American Indians (Maya): 10,030
- Caribs: 4,112
- White: 2,329
- East Indians: 1,366
- Syrians: 128
- Chinese: 50
- Race not stated: 152

a great many persons would have considerable difficulty in deciding to which group they belong.

English is the official language and the language taught in the schools. Spanish is also in common use, chiefly by the Indians—whose language it is tending to replace. The term Creole is now commonly used to denote local negroes and persons of negro extraction; it is also used in respect of persons of mixed Spanish and Indian descent. The Census figure for Creoles therefore includes pure-blooded negroes as well as Latin-Americans. These latter immigrants now form an increasing proportion of the population.

Geographical Features

The coastline is, for the most part, flat and swampy, but the country rises gradually towards the interior. The Maya Mountains and the Cockscombs, which reach a height of 3,700 feet, form the backbone of the southern half of the Colony. All of the western (Cayo) District is hilly and includes the Mountain Pine Ridge most of which lies between 1,000 and 2,000 feet above sea level but rises in parts to around 3,000 feet. The northern districts are also hilly except towards the coast but contain considerable areas of low table land. There are seventeen principal rivers, of which the Belize River is the most important. None is navigable by vessels over five feet draught and few for any notable distance. An estimated 92% of the mainland is under forest.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and on the whole agreeable to non-tropical peoples. In the capital, Belize, the temperature range during the year is 50° to 96° with an average mean of 78·5°. Most of the year the heat and humidity are tempered by sea breezes. This description applies with small variation along the whole coastal area. Inland the day temperatures, during the dry season, tend to be higher, up to 100°, but drop considerably at night. Rainfall increases from north to south:

| Annual average Inches |
|-----------------------|
| Corozal (north)       | 51 |
| Belize (central)      | 63 |
| El Cayo (western central) | 52 |
| Stann Creek (upper south) | 147 |
| Toledo (south)        | 175 |

There are two dry seasons, the main one from March to May and the other in August and September (called the Maugre Season).

The Colony has been struck from time to time by hurricanes; the most disastrous in recent history struck Belize on 10th September, 1931, causing heavy loss of life and property.

Principal Towns

| Population (1946 census) |
|--------------------------|
| Belize (capital)         | 21,886 |
| Corozal                  | 2,190 |
| Orange Walk              | 1,395 |
| Cayo                     | 1,548 |
| Stann Creek              | 3,414 |
| Punta Gorda              | 1,375 |

The population of Belize is now estimated at 27,000 due to a shift from the less favoured district towns.

History

The present Settlement was apparently established in 1638 but British sea rovers were frequenting the Bay from long before that year, and there is some evidence that a Settlement was formed in or around 1603. Logwood was the attraction, and the 1638 Settlement was augmented from time to time by sea rovers and—notably after the capture of Jamaica by British Forces in 1655—by disbanded British soldiers and sailors. In the Treaty of Madrid, 1670, Spain recognized Britain's sovereignty over the Bay Settlement.

Concurrently another and larger British Settlement was building up on the Moskito Indian Coast, far to the south of British Honduras. Modern historians frequently confuse the two Settlements; but although they assisted each other on occasion, they were entirely separate organizations with quite different forms of government. The Moskito Indians stubbornly and successfully resisted Spanish intrusion but welcomed and became loyal allies of the British settlers. The Moskito Coast settlers were known as the Shoremen and the Bay settlers as the Baymen. In 1786 Britain handed over the Moskito Coast to Spain in return for a small and comparatively worthless strip of land contiguous to the Bay Settlement. Some of the Shoremen moved to Jamaica and the rest were compulsorily evacuated to the strip, where they became merged with the Baymen.

The Bay Settlement was a piece of purely British pioneering. The Spaniards found plentiful supplies of logwood, and Indians for slaves, in Northern Yucatan and settled there. Southern Yucatan, on the other hand, was by then practically devoid of Indians and its littoral was a wilderness of mosquito-infested mangrove swamps guarded by lee-shore reefs and tricky channels. The Spaniards therefore left this coast alone until the British began to settle around the mouth of the Belize River. The export of logwood from the Bay Settlement broke the highly profitable Spanish monopoly, brought great prosperity to Britain's wool and cloth-dyeing trades and caused Spain to launch attack after attack on the Settlement in an effort to drive out her competitors.

This armed aggression continued until 1798, when the Spaniards invaded the Settlement in strong naval and military force. The Baymen, although badly under-armed and heavily outnumbered, resisted and, after several days of skirmishing, the forces met in sea battle off St. George's Cay. Supported by H.M. Sloop Merlin, the Baymen fought with such determination that the Spaniards were forced to retreat. This was Spain's last attempt to dislodge the Baymen by force of arms.
Until 1786 the Baymen governed themselves. In that year, after many petitions from the Baymen, England appointed and sent out a Superintendent but the office was allowed to lapse in 1791. In 1797 Colonel Thomas Barrow was appointed Superintendent and was also given the title of Commander-in-Chief (held by the Governors of the Colony ever since) to enable him to organize the defence against the obviously impending Spanish attack. Thereafter the office of Superintendent continued until 1862 when it was replaced by that of Lieutenant-Governor, under the Governor of Jamaica, and the Settlement raised to the status of a Colony. The Baymen resented being subordinated to Jamaica and in 1884 the Colony was detached from Jamaica and given a Governor.

**Constitution**

In 1954 the Legislative Council was replaced by a Legislative Assembly composed of nine elected members, three ex officio members, and a Speaker and three unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The status of the Executive Council was changed to that of chief instrument of policy, and it is now composed of the Governor, as Chairman, three ex officio members, and six members of the Legislative Assembly. The latter are elected by the Assembly but must include not less than two of the nominated unofficial members of that body. Universal adult suffrage was also introduced in 1954, and the first general election under the new Constitution was held on 28th April, 1954. The only fully organized party, the People's United Party, gained eight of the nine elected seats.

**Land Policy**

The alienation of Crown land is carefully controlled to prevent, as far as possible, the acquisition of such land for purely speculative, non-productive purposes. No racial discrimination is exercised.

During 1953 and 1954 a land use survey was carried out. A land policy, based on the findings and recommendations of the Survey Team, is in process of formulation; it is expected to be completed and brought into operation by 1955.

**Taxation**

Income tax is levied on a graduated scale rising from 5% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 45% on all income over $25,000. Surtax is levied on the first $2,000 in excess of $8,000 of chargeable income at the rate of 10%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 15%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 20%; and on the remainder at 25%. Deductions allowed against income are a personal allowance of $600, plus allowances for wife, children, dependent relatives, life assurance premiums, earned income and gifts to charity. The rate of tax on Companies is 35% on the first $100,000 of chargeable income, 37½% on the next $100,000 and 40% on the remainder.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure | Grants-in-aid |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 1938 | 1,740,602 | 1,872,413 | — |
| 1949 | 3,711,232 | 3,847,374 | 339,800 |
| 1950 | 5,360,473 | 5,415,753 | 820,000 |
| 1951 | 4,883,952 | 4,441,305 | — |
| 1952 | 4,921,202 | 4,907,330 | — |
| 1953 | 5,768,045 | 5,528,355 | — |

It was estimated that in 1953 approximately 47% of the true revenue was derived from Customs duties and charges and 32% from internal taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: administration 40%, public works 19%, medical and health 12%, education 10%, other social development and welfare services 2%.

The Public Debt of the Colony at the end of 1953 amounted to $1,917,423 of which $482,750 was in respect of borrowings made locally. Sinking funds on hand amounted to $495,197, leaving $1,422,226 as the net outstanding debt. Of this debt over $830,492 was in respect of amounts re-loaned to municipal quasi-government bodies and government servants. During 1952 a Development Loan Ordinance (No. 21 of 1952) was passed authorizing the raising of a loan of $2,400,000 but no monies were raised under it until 1953 when $429,392 was raised. Of this amount $200,000 was obtained locally.

**Currency**

The unit of currency is the British Honduras dollar which is exchanged at four to the £ sterling. Notes of $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 are issued and there is a silver coinage of 50, 25 and 10 cents, a nickel coin of 25 cents (new issue) and one of 5 cents, and a bronze 1 cent coin.

**Development Plans**

British Honduras received an allocation of £600,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds in 1945, followed by a further £850,000 as a result of recommendations in the Evans Report in 1949. In 1952 a further £800,000 was allocated to the Colony to finance the next stage of development, which is primarily in the field of agriculture. The Plan, which includes also loan funds of about £600,000 ($2,400,000), covers a four-year programme; and in addition to the funds voted to agriculture, substantial allocations have been made for the consolidation of internal communications, the expansion and improvement of the electricity supply in Belize, re-afforestation, and social services.

**Other Development**

The Colonial Development Corporation has reduced its projects in the Colony to ramie and oranges, both on a small scale. The Fort George Hotel, built by the Corporation, was opened for business early in 1953. It has 35 bedrooms and is designed for tourist trade.

The Citrus Company of British Honduras continues to expand the cultivation of grapefruit and oranges in the Stann Creek Valley. Exports of oranges and products thereof are increasing. The Company is also considering opening groves in the Western District.

**Education**

Primary education is principally through subsidized denominational schools controlled by a Board of Education. There are two government and 93 grant-aided primary schools with an enrolment of 12,690. In addition there are 24 unaided primary schools. There are six secondary schools, all unaided and denominational, and one government-run Technical High School. A Teacher Training College was opened in Belize in June, 1954. There is no provision for education of university standard but scholarships are awarded which carry the recipients to the University College of the West Indies (Jamaica). The University College stations an Extramural Tutor in Belize.
The actual expenditure on education from general revenue during 1953 was $387,648, compared with $71,175 in 1935. In addition $18,000 was devoted to Listowel Boys' Training School for delinquent boys.

Libraries, etc.

The Jubilee Public Library has reading rooms, a reference section, a lending section, a children's section, and a stock of about 15,000 books. Boxes of books are circulated to small sub-libraries in the districts. The Baron Bliss Institute, Belize, was formally handed over to Government by the Baron Bliss Trust in 1954. The Institute has a modern dramatic stage and auditorium, lecture rooms, an exhibition hall and in addition houses the Jubilee Library and the local branch of the Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies.

Health

The Colony is relatively free from endemic disease. Malaria, which is most prevalent, has shown a substantial decrease in incidence owing to the half-yearly spraying with D.D.T. undertaken by government. The main hospital is in Belize and there are small hospitals in each of the five districts, all run by government. Beds total 244. In 1953 there were 5,701 admissions to the six hospitals and the out-patients department of the Belize Hospital recorded 50,249 attendances. Eleven rural dispensaries in the more important villages are each in charge of a qualified rural health nurse.

Actual expenditure on health services from general revenue during 1953 was $458,641, compared with $80,071 in 1935.

Communications

Stanley Field, about ten miles north-west of Belize, is the principal airport of the Colony. International air services are operated to the Colony by the following airlines:

- British West Indian Airways (B.W.I.A.),
- Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (T.A.C.A. International).
- Servicio Aereo de Honduras, S.A. (S.A.H.S.A.).

In addition, British Colonial Airways, based in Belize, fly a scheduled round trip to Chetumal three times a week, using small, three-passenger planes.

There is a weekly service between Jamaica and Belize and a thrice weekly service New Orleans (U.S.A.), Belize, Guatemala City, Tegucigalpa (Republic of Honduras) and return. British Colonial Airways also operate an internal air service, on schedule to certain district towns and on charter to other parts of the Colony.

There are about 400 miles of all-weather roads in the Colony; in addition there are 128 miles of feeder roads usable by motor traffic and 162 miles of government-maintained bush trails and cart roads, some of them passable by motor traffic during dry weather. Logging trails, built and maintained by timber operators, can also be used by e.g., jeeps and landrovers, in the dry season.

The only fairly regular passenger ship service is supplied by the Cayman Shipping Company which operates small vessels more or less fortnightly between Belize and Kingston, Jamaica. Cargo service is provided from the United States of America at irregular intervals by the United Fruit Company, and from the United Kingdom by T. and J. Harrison, Ltd. In 1953 a total of 559 steam and motor vessels and 910 sailing vessels, 267,441 tons in all, entered the Colony.

Broadcasting

Government operates a radio broadcasting service (B.H.B.S.) transmitting on the following frequencies and powers: 1,280 kc/s (235 metres), 500 watts; 3·3 Mc/s. (90 metres), 5 Kw. and 4·9 Mc/s. (60 metres), 250 watts. Programmes are given in English and Spanish and include both local and foreign news, announcements of local interest, transcribed music and plays. Daily time totals four hours but will increase as local talent, now being fostered, becomes available. Licensed receiving sets in the Colony totalled 1,748 at the end of 1953.

Principal Occupations

The numbers engaged in the principal occupations at the 1946 census were:

- Agriculture: 5,865
- Manufacture and Repair: 2,551
- Forestry: 2,040
- Personal Service: 1,879
- Trade and Finance: 1,716
- Public Service: 1,357

Membership of trade unions totalled 11,034. Actual financial membership is well below that figure. There are six trade unions in the Colony, of which the largest is the General Workers' Union with a nominal membership of 9,800.

Main Crops and Products

Indian corn (maize), beans and peas, rice, cassava, and yams are the principal food crops of the Colony. The main export crops are coconuts, citrus fruits and products, bananas and maize. Pigs and poultry are raised throughout the Colony. Timber is the principal export product, mainly mahogany, pine, and cedar. Rosewood, Banak, Santa Maria and other woods are also exported. Efforts are being directed to building up the Colony's fisheries and an export trade to the United States, chiefly in lobsters, is growing.

Of industries, sawmilling is the most important (21 mills in operation at the end of 1953) and there are a cigarette factory, a soap factory, an aluminium door, window and louvre fabricating factory, and several small furniture factories operating in Belize. In different parts of the Colony there are canneries, one operating in the Stann Creek Valley on citrus products is of notable size, and in the Corozal District there is a large sugar factory.

The chief imports are vehicles, motor spirits, machinery, cotton and artificial silk piece-goods, beans and peas, condensed, evaporated and powdered milk, flour, butter, margarine, and lard substitutes.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Marketing Board is operated by Government; its principal concern is with the purchase of agricultural produce such as rice, beans and corn at guaranteed prices and the marketing of these products both locally and abroad. It also makes seasonal crop loans.

At the end of 1953 there were 22 Credit Unions, four Consumer Co-operatives, six Marketing Co-operatives, two Farmers' Co-operatives and one Housing Co-operative. In addition there were 41 junior and senior Savings Unions.

Government Publications

Those of special interest, issued in 1954, include:

- Review of Progress in the Development and Welfare of the Colony of British Honduras during the period 1948–54. (Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1954.)
- A Brief Sketch of British Honduras, By A. H. Anderson (1954 amended reprint).
