## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Budget level**: Level I ($100-299K) or Level II ($300-800K)?
   - Level II allows postdoc + more development time
   - Level I is more conservative, higher success rate?

2. **Postdoc location**: Based at Edinburgh or Saskatchewan?
   - Edinburgh: closer to Bea, Turing connections
   - Saskatchewan: closer to PI, LINCS

3. **LINCS scope**: In-kind infrastructure only, or budgeted collaboration?
   - Check with Susan Brown

4. **LLM strategy**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, or open-source models?
   - Cost vs. reproducibility tradeoff
   - Schmidt Sciences offers free compute — relevant?

5. **Gold standard size**: How much manual annotation is realistic?
   - Affects accuracy claims and timeline

## Contacts

| Person | Role | Email | Status |
|--------|------|-------|--------|
| Bea Alex | Co-PI (AI) | [Edinburgh email] | To contact |
| Susan Brown | Collaborator (LINCS) | [Guelph email] | To contact |
| Schmidt Sciences | Funder | [email protected] | For questions |

---

## Notes

- **Indirect costs capped at 10%** — check both institutions' policies
- **Schmidt offers free computing** — mention in budget justification
- **Global eligibility** — UK-Canada collaboration is fine
- **Trading Consequences** — emphasize this throughout as proof of collaboration

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bea unavailable | Contact Mariona Coll Ardanuy immediately |
| Budget disagreements | Discuss early, Week 1 |
| Technical approach unclear | Run pilot extraction Week 2-3 |
| Missed deadline | Submit 2 days early, buffer time |
| Page limit issues | Draft lean, cut early |
