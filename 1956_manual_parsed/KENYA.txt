KENYA

Area
The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East African Protectorate, includes parts of the great African Lakes, Victoria and Rudolf; the land area is approximately 219,730 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 224,960 square miles.

Population
At 1st July, 1955, the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at over 6·0 million persons, of whom over 5·8 million were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe     | Per cent. |
|-----------|-----------|
| Kikuyu    | 19·5      |
| Luo       | 14·4      |
| Baluhya   | 12·5      |
| Kamba     | 11·7      |
| Meru      | 6·2       |
| Nyika     | 5·6       |

The 1948 census showed a total non-African population of 154,846 of whom 90,528 were Indians, 29,660 Europeans and 24,174 Arabs. The non-African population at the middle of 1955 has been estimated at 230,000.

Geographical Features
Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Teita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Kulai 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,058 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,120). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30-40 miles wide and 2,000-3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

Climate
The climate varies greatly. Three broad divisions exist:

1. The coast and its immediate hinterland;
2. The low plain, 300-2,000 feet, extending from the borders of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to the boundary of Tanganyika.
3. The Highlands, 3,000-10,000 feet.

History
The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Ethiopia in 1947 which supersedes the original agreement of 1908.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten sea miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which an annuity of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made in 1837 to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and

1893) and Italy (1891), and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution

Under additional Royal Instructions dated the 13th of April, 1954, there was set up a Council of Ministers, consisting of the Deputy Governor and eight ex officio and six appointed Ministers, as follows: the Chief Secretary, the Minister for Legal Affairs, the Minister for Finance and Development, the Minister for African Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Water Resources, the Minister for Internal Security and Defence, the Minister for Local Government, Health and Housing, the Minister for Education, Labour and Lands, the Minister for Forest Development, Game and Fisheries, the Minister for Commerce and Industry, the Minister for Works, the Minister for Community Development, a European Minister without portfolio and an Asian Minister without portfolio.

The Executive Council consists of the Ministers and such other persons, who are styled Appointed Members, as may be appointed by the Governor. There are at present three such Appointed Members, two being African and one Arab.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor who is President, a Vice-President who is Speaker and 54 Members of whom eight are ex officio (Ministers), 18 Nominated Members (who all accept the Government whip on major issues of policy), 14 European Elected Members (of whom three have ministerial functions), six Asian Elected Members (of whom two have ministerial functions and one is a Parliamentary Secretary), one Arab Elected Member, six African Representative Members (of whom one has ministerial functions and one is a Parliamentary Secretary) and one Arab Representative Member (who is also a Parliamentary Secretary).

In the East African Central Legislative Assembly Kenya is represented by one Official and four Unofficial Members, two of the latter being European, one Asian, and one African.

By the Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Nyeri and various other places.

A General Election was held in 1952 for the constituencies established by the Legislative Council (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1951. This Ordinance defined the boundaries of the 14 European Electoral Areas, the six Asian and the one Arab Electoral Areas. The six African Representative members were appointed from among the names submitted by each of the electoral colleges set up in each of six areas of the Colony.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by non-African Local Authorities. There are now 24 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local legislation regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. The Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, enables District Councils in the settled areas to prepare schemes for organizing the local government of their area into a County Council. Five County Councils have now been created; these councils include five townships established under the Townships Ordinance, 1931, which had achieved self-accounting status prior to absorption as urban district councils.

In addition there are six municipalities established under the Municipalities Ordinance, 1928, including The City Council of Nairobi which received a Royal Charter in 1950. There are two self-accounting townships established under the Townships Ordinance which have not been incorporated into any county scheme of local government.

In October, 1952, a State of Emergency was declared in Kenya. The Government then assumed special powers in order to maintain law and order in the face of a campaign of violence and barbarous atrocity engineered, principally amongst the Kikuyu, by the Mau Mau secret society. The Government, aided by the Security Forces, which include the Kenya Police Reserve and the Kikuyu Home Guard, as well as by United Kingdom troops under the command of Lieutenant-General G. W. Lathbury, C.B., D.S.O., M.B.E., is making strenuous efforts to stamp out terrorism. In May, 1953, Sir Frederick Crawford was appointed to the post of Deputy Governor in order to lighten the administrative burden falling upon the Governor as a result of the Emergency.

Land Policy

All land in Kenya falls into one of two categories:

(a) Crown lands.

(b) Native lands.

"Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

"Native lands" are permanently reserved for Africans in so far as the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of the land are concerned and all the rights enjoyed under native laws and custom are preserved.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township or native reserve, may be alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

Taxation

The forms of direct taxation are:— income tax, which applies to all members of the community; personal tax, which applies to Europeans and Asians; poll tax, which applies to Africans, and hospital tax contribution, which applies to
Europeans. Under the Income Tax Law generous personal allowances are given and the rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 1/50 in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases on a graduated scale to Shs. 11/- in the £ on incomes exceeding £50,000 per annum. In addition a surcharge of 75 cents is made on each £ of chargeable income in excess of £800. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/- in the £. The maximum rate of the personal tax is £10 per annum and the amount of the hospital contribution is calculated on the amount of total income.

The other main forms of taxation are Customs and excise duties.

* Note that the financial year of the Colony was changed in 1954 and now runs from July 1st to June 30th.

† Receipts into and Issues from the Exchequer Account.

The figures of revenue and expenditure for financial years before 1954–55 are gross, i.e., they include provision on both sides for services, the cost of which is reimbursed by other Governments and certain Departments of the Kenya Government.

The main heads of revenue paid into the Exchequer Account for 1954–55 were:

- Customs and Excise: £10,615,050
- Income Tax: £8,123,000
- African Poll Tax: £975,165
- Other Licences, Duties and Taxes: £2,497,546
- Other Revenue: £12,790,087

Total: £35,000,848

In the same year the main groups of expenditure, excluding reimbursements by other Governments, etc., were:

- Services under the Minister for Finance and Development: £22,111,623 (of which Public Debt £1,291,000)
- Cost of High Commission Services: £1,248,621
- Contributions to Emergency Fund: £16,000,000
- Services under the Minister for Agriculture: £1,635,418
- Services under the Minister for Internal Security and Defence: £3,907,256

- Services under the Minister for Education, Labour and Lands: £4,117,842
- Services under the Minister for Works: £1,650,000

In 1954–55, in addition to the expenditure of £38,930,038 mentioned above, issues from the Exchequer Account for expenditure under the Colony's Development Plan and the Swynnerton Plan for the Intensified Development of African Agriculture amounted to £7,238,801.

The Public Debt of Kenya at 30th June, 1954, was £33,064,740, made up as follows:

- Funded Debt: £31,830,600 (of which £6,696,091 was raised for E.A. Railways and Harbours Administration)
- Loan from Uganda Government for Hill School, Eldoret: £165,000
- Loans from three Banks for Mombasa Water Supply Major Project: £835,000
- Loans from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote: £234,140

Total: £33,064,740

### Currency

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also British Somaliland and Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/- and Shs. 1/- notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

### Development Plans

The Government proposals for a development programme over the period 1st January, 1954, to 30th June, 1957, are self-contained in that they are not merely an extension of the ten-year development programme, 1946–55. The circumstances prevailing when both the 1946 Development Committee and the 1951 Standing Planning Committee reported have changed in a number of important aspects. The Government considers that in the light of experience a ten-year plan becomes in time unrealistic and that, in present circumstances, three or four years is the most suitable period for which a development plan should be drawn up.

The ten-year plan envisaged expenditure of £38·8 million and by 31st December, 1953, £27·4 million had been spent; thus over eight years 70·5 per cent. of the plan had been implemented.

During the years 1946–53 no less than 18 per cent. of expenditure was financed from various appropriated funds, 24 per cent. by contributions from Colony revenue and only 45 per cent. by loan moneys. In this planning period 89 per cent. of the funds likely to be available by 30th June, 1957, will come from loan sources.

The allocations under the new three-and-a-half-year plan total £23·7 million and a capital gap of £2·1 million at present exists. It will be
the responsibility of the Development Committee appointed under the terms of Cmd. Paper 9103 to make the necessary adjustments to the plan in due course if additional funds cannot be raised to cover the gap.

Summary of Allocations under Three-and-a-half-year Plan by Ministerial Portfolios

|                          | 1954/57 Per Cent. |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Chief Secretary          | 6·4               |
| Legal Affairs            | 0·3               |
| African Affairs          | 1·4               |
| Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Water Resources | 17·7 |
| Internal Security and Defence | 17·3 |
| Local Government, Health and Housing | 18·4 |
| Education, Labour and Lands | 15·7 |
| Forest Development, Game and Fisheries | 1·0 |
| Commerce and Industry    | 9·0               |
| Works (a)                | 12·3              |
| Community Development    | 0·5               |

(a) Not including the allocation for the General Works Staff.

Emphasis will be placed in this planning period on the development of African agriculture. Expenditure on ordinary development will be partly financed from the Development Fund and partly from the £5·0 million grant made available by Her Majesty's Government for the Swynnerton Plan. If account is also taken of expenditure on African agriculture included in the three-and-a-half-year Development Plan the total of no less than £4·9 million will be spent on the development of African agriculture by the 30th June, 1957.

Education (1954 figures)—African

The number of African post-primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions was 64 with an enrolment of 4,640 males and 659 females. Twenty-four of these were Government-run with an enrolment of 2,573 males and 87 females, and 39 were aided, with 2,044 males and 572 females. One was unaided, with 23 males.

There were 3,230 primary and intermediate schools with 347,892 pupils. Of these 19 were Government-run with an enrolment of 1,531 males and 335 females, 2,460 were aided, with 232,771 males and 71,437 females, and 751 were unaided, with 34,109 males and 7,709 females.

Asian Education

The number of secondary schools was 17 (10 Government and 7 private) with a total enrolment of 4,820, of whom 1,303 were in private schools. The total number of primary schools was 108, of which 22 were Government-run, 83 were aided and 3 were unaided. There were 30,241 pupils on roll, of whom 16,100 were in aided schools and 70 in unaided schools. Of the total, 16,138 were boys and 14,103 were girls. There are 3 Government Teacher Training Colleges for Asian students. The enrolment at the end of 1954 was 73 boys and 74 girls.

European Education

There were 10 secondary schools of which 5 had classes for primary school children. The total number of secondary pupils was 2,245. There were 4 Government schools with 1,575 pupils, one aided school with 158 pupils and the 5 other schools with 512 pupils were unaided. Schools providing primary education numbered 38, with a total enrolment of 6,249 pupils. There were 14 Government schools with 4,080 pupils, 15 aided schools with 879 pupils, and 9 unaided schools with 1,290 pupils.

Arab and Other Races' Education

There was one Government Boys' secondary school with an enrolment of 86 at the end of the year. In the 9 Government primary schools there was an enrolment of 1,575 boys and 418 girls.

Children of other races are educated in 5 schools in which the majority of pupils are Goans and Asians. No separate record of the numbers of these children was obtained in 1954.

Higher Education

The only institution for higher education in East Africa at present is Makerere College in Uganda. In 1955, 60 Kenya students were admitted to the College making a total of 203 students in all from Kenya in residence.

The Royal Technical College, now under construction in Nairobi, is due to open in March 1956. It will initially provide Technical Institute courses in addition to advanced professional courses.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education, usually in institutions overseas. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds allocated under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also a few scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly for local education, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for teachers to enable them to take degree and other courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts. Among other sources of funds to assist students in going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Government of India, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards made on the recommendation of a Committee for Study and Training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

The total number of Kenya students in the United Kingdom for the academic session 1954–55 was 588. This number included 46 Africans (30 with bursaries or scholarships), 7 Arabs (6 with bursaries or scholarships), 360 Asians (60 with bursaries or scholarships), 175 Europeans (55 with bursaries or scholarships). There were also 44 Kenya African students in India during this period and 16 in the United States.

Trade and Technical Education

There were three Government Technical and Trade Schools for African boys admitting students who had completed eight years of schooling for a three or four-year course of training; 859 indentured apprentices were receiving instruction in building, engineering, tailoring and leather working.

Vocational training was also given in two aided schools and one non-aided school, and on a number of mission stations. A number of Government Departments, East African Railways and Harbours and the Posts and Telegraphs Administration, conducted training schemes for students from the intermediate and secondary schools entering their service.
The Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education which ranks as a Technical Institute had 200 students enrolled.

There were two Asian Technical High Schools providing courses in technical and commercial subjects to School Certificate standard with 725 pupils on the roll.

Total Government expenditure on education in 1954 was estimated at £4,210,121, compared with £170,000 in 1935.

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library and the Desai Memorial Library, both in Nairobi, and also the Seif bin Salim Public Library in Mombasa. The Government has a small library of general reference books and books on Africa.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Curator, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, is assisted by a staff of eight Europeans and eighteen Africans.

Health

In 1954 beds available in Hospitals (including Maternity Homes) totalled 8,167 (Government 6,021, Local Authorities 482, Missions 1,173, Private 491). In-patients in Government Hospitals totalled 174,390, out-patients 1,246,320.

Total expenditure by the Medical Department on Hospital Health Services in the six months ending 30th June, 1954, was £682,313, compared with £203,451 in 1935.

Communications

Eastleigh airport, Nairobi, is the main aerodrome used by international services. Internal scheduled services operated by E.A.A.C. are based on Nairobi West and operate services in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of aircraft-operating companies are based at Nairobi West. Air Safety and Aeradio Services are provided by the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. All air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the Air Transport Authority.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Aden, Ethiopia and Madagascar.

There are approximately 22,000 miles of roads. Only about 350 are bitumen surfaced. The main roads (2,800 miles, excluding Northern Frontier Province), where not bituminized, are gravel-surfaced and, for the most part, all-weather except during excessive rains. Secondary roads (4,200 miles) are mostly gravel-surfaced, but are more subject to closure to heavy traffic in wet weather. Considerable improvements in alignment and formation have been effected on the main roads, and many secondary roads, during recent years. The Great North Road (Cape Town to Cairo) through Kenya, from Namanga on the Tanganyika border in the south and via Nairobi, has been re-routed through Eldoret to Tororo on the Uganda border.

Broadcasting

A broadcast transmitting station is operated at Nairobi by Cable and Wireless Limited. Programme material for a European and an Asian Service is produced by Cable and Wireless in their own Studios. All broadcasting to Africans, in Swahili, Kikuyu, Luo, Luluhya, Kikamba and Nandi/Kipsigis, is produced in the studios of the African Broadcasting Service, which is part of the Department of Information, and fed by land line to Cable and Wireless Ltd., for transmission on medium and short wave transmitters owned by the Department of Information and operated on its behalf by Cable and Wireless Ltd. Local broadcasts in Swahili and Arabic are also originated in a Department of Information Studio in Mombasa and transmitted there by Cable and Wireless Ltd. At Nyeri the Department operates its own short wave transmitter and originates six hours of Kikuyu broadcasting daily in its Studios there. The Department of Information has distributed several thousand radio sets to African listeners; the vernacular programmes are relayed by mobile vans in market places, etc., and rediffusion schemes are in operation in Nairobi and Nakuru. There are at present 18,000 licensed receiving sets in use in Kenya.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. Many Africans in the Highlands also own forest plantations. The numbers reported in employment in other occupations in 1954 are shown in the following table:

| Occupation                          | Africans | Asians | Europeans |
|-------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are sisal, coffee, tea, wattle extract, cotton, maize, wheat and pyrethrum.

Beef production, dairying, sheep, pigs and poultry play an increasingly important role in the general agricultural policy of the Colony and considerable quantities of meat, butter, hides and skins, wool and bacon are produced annually. In addition there is considerable African production of millets, grains and pulses which often yield an exportable surplus.
The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony's timber supplies—softwoods such as Podocarpus and pencil cedar and hardwoods such as East African olive and camphor. Forest produce from the established plantations is becoming available in increasing quantities and already provides some 18% of the annual softwoods production of the Colony, as well as considerable numbers of poles. The annual yield of mangrove poles from the coastal areas is in the region of 450,000.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and in Lake Victoria and apart from seasonal shortages, an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The chief minerals in order of value covering the year 1954 were soda ash, salt, mullite, gold, limestone products, diatomite, carbon dioxide gas and graphite. The total value of minerals won during 1954 was £1,773,946.

There are some 80 main types of manufacturing and industrial activity, producing goods for local consumption and export. The main productions for export are aluminium holloware, bacon and pork products, butter, canned foodstuffs, cheese, coffee, tea, diatomite products, essential oil, gold, soda, hydrogenated oils, kyanite and mullite, passion fruit juice and pulp, pyrethrum extract, sisal products, tanned leather, wattle extract or bark, pencil slats. Fancy leather goods and native curios are made by individual craftsmen for local consumption and export.

THE LEEWARD ISLANDS

Area and Geographical Features.

The Colony has a total area of 423 square miles, and consists of a number of islands belonging partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. Anguilla, Sombrero and the British Virgin Islands lie apart, to the north and north-west. St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat and Redonda form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, and Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Antigua is the seat of government and residence of the Governor.

Population

The total population of the Colony at the 1946 census and the estimates at 31st December, 1954, are shown in the following table:

|                | Census 1946 | Estimate 1954 |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Antigua        | 41,757      | 50,908        |
| St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla | 46,243     | 53,598        |
| Montserrat     | 14,333      | 14,145        |
| Virgin Islands | 6,505       | 7,600         |
| **Total**      | **108,838** | **126,251**   |

Climate

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average annual rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to January.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493 and became British during the seventeenth century. They have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonized from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a humane slave amelioration Act.

Constitution

By the Leeward Islands Act, 1871, an Executive Council and a legislative body styled the General Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the five Presidencies (now four—Dominica became a colony of the Windward Islands on 1st January, 1940) which comprise the Colony. There is a majority of elected (now called representative) members on the General Legislative Council, there being five representative members each from the Presidential Legislatures of Antigua and St. Kitts—Nevis—Anguilla, two representative members from the Presidential Legislature of Montserrat and one representative member from the Presidential Legislature of the Virgin Islands, a total of 13 members. The representative members on the General Legislative Council are chosen by the unofficial members of the Presidential Legislatures from amongst the elected members of those Legislatures. The official members of the General Legislative Council are the Colonial Secretary, the Administrators of Antigua and St. Kitts—Nevis—Anguilla, the Attorney-General, the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and two persons holding office of emolument under the Government of the Colony or of any Presidency appointed by the Governor, a total of eight members. There are also two nominated members, appointed by the Governor from amongst the nominated members of the Presidential Legislatures. The Governor is President of the Council and has a casting, but not an original, vote. There is also a Deputy President of the Council chosen from amongst its members.

The Federal Executive Council comprises four *ex officio* members and ten appointed members, of whom three are official and seven unofficial.

The General Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the General Legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council, the life of which cannot exceed three years, meets at least once a year, at a place notified by Proclamation. There are usually two sessions a year lasting several days on each occasion.
The expenses of the federal establishment are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

As already announced, it is proposed, however, to abolish as soon as practicable the present Federal Government and it is expected that this will take place in July, 1956. The four Presidencies of the Leeward Islands will then become separate Colonies, the whole group remaining under one Governor.

Presidential members on the General Legislative Council are also associated with the administration of their Presidencies. In recent years they have been appointed to Committees dealing with such subjects as social services, public works and trade and production, under the chairmanship of elected members. This arrangement was superseded in the Presidencies of Antigua and St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla by the introduction of the Ministerial system on the 19th January, 1956, on the lines of the constitutions already in force in Barbados, Trinidad and Jamaica. Under the new system in these two Presidencies the Executive Council has become the principal instrument of policy; in both Antigua and St. Kitts all the unofficial Executive Council members except one are to be elected by the unofficial members of the Presidential Legislative Council, the elected members thus having a voting majority on Executive Council. The Governor in Council is to appoint three Ministers in both Presidencies: the Minister for Trade and Production, the Minister for Communications and Works and the Minister for Social Services.

Currency

The British Caribbean Currency Board controls a unified decimal system of currency for the Eastern Group of the British Caribbean Territories. United States currency circulates freely in the Virgin Islands, where all values and prices are determined by it.

ANTIGUA

Area

The area of Antigua is 108 square miles, the Dependency of Barbuda 62 square miles, the Dependency of Redonda (uninhabited) half a square mile. Barbuda lies 25 miles to the north, Redonda 25 miles to the south-west of the main island.

Principal Town

St. John's, the capital, has a population of about 11,000.

Geographical Features

The western part of the island of Antigua is composed entirely of volcanic rocks (highest point Boggy Peak, 1,330 feet). The eastern and northern parts are of limestone, below 500 feet above sea level, and a central plain stretches diagonally across the island. Barbuda is very flat with a large lagoon on the west side. There are no rivers.

History

The first settlers were a few English who arrived in 1632. In 1663 Charles II made a formal grant to Lord Willoughby, who at once proceeded to send out large numbers of colonists. For a short time the island was in French occupation, but in 1667 it was declared an English possession in terms of the Treaty of Breda and has remained British from that date.

Constitution

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Administrator, two official members and five unofficial members. The Governor, and in his absence, the Administrator, presides over the Executive Council.
The Legislative Council, as reconstituted in December 1951, is composed of the Administrator as President, two official members, three nominated and eight elected members. A Deputy President is elected by the unofficial members of the Council from among their number.

**Land Policy**

Land may not be alienated or leased to aliens without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, alien occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. There is a small amount of Crown land which, when not used for public purposes, may be leased or sold.

**Taxation**

The main forms of taxation are income tax, trade tariffs and excise duties. The rates of individual income tax range from 6d. to 15s. 0d. per £ of chargeable income. Company tax is 6s. 8d. per £ of chargeable income.

Provision has been made for double taxation relief with the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand and consideration is being given to extending the arrangements to other countries.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue $000 B.W.I. | Expenditure $000 B.W.I. |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1938 | ..                | 595                    |
| 1950 | ..                | 3,110                  |
| 1951 | ..                | 3,673                  |
| 1952 | ..                | 4,212                  |
| 1953 | ..                | 4,985                  |
| 1954 | ..                | 4,725                  |

In 1954 $915,442 of revenue was derived from fees of court, etc. and $943,056 from Customs duties.

The main heads of expenditure were:—Agriculture $1,113,013; Health $487,510; Public Works Recurrent $597,183; and Education $323,245.

**Development Plans**

Antigua was originally allocated £499,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. A further grant of £200,000 was made in 1952, bringing the total allocation to £699,000. The actual expenditure under various schemes, in progress and completed, up to August 1954 was £665,323 made up as follows:

- Public Works .. 190,972
- Social Services .. 85,295
- Productive Services .. 298,489
- Housing .. 90,567

This has left a balance of £33,677 to which should be added £10,000 transferred from the Federal allocation. The allocation for the period 1955–60 has been fixed at £680,000.

**Education**

There are 31 Government elementary schools, and six recognized private schools, with a total enrolment of 10,953 pupils. The six secondary schools—four grant-aided and two denominational—have a total enrolment of 1,273 pupils. A Teachers' Training College accommodates 20 female teachers from the four Presidencies of the Colony. The graduation standard from this college approximates to that of the Cambridge Higher School Certificate. There are 20 students studying in the United Kingdom, 30 in the United States and six at the University College of the West Indies in Jamaica. Government expenditure on education in 1954 was $323,245 compared with $21,650 in 1935.

**Libraries**
