SEYCHELLES

Area
The Colony lies in the Indian Ocean 970 miles east of Zanzibar. Its area is 156½ square miles.

Population
The estimate at 31st December, 1954, was 37,800.

Principal Town
Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 9,000.

Geographical Features
The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over fourteen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate
In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70-135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon, and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. Malaria is unknown.

The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare. The average annual rainfall in Victoria in 1954 was 90·88 inches and the mean temperature was 82°.

History
The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahe in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May, 1794, when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Isle de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution, and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

Constitution
The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, three official members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy
All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation
The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. Residents are eligible for the following personal allowances:

- Earned income: Rs. 1,500 (max. Rs. 1,500)
- Personal (single): Rs. 500
- Personal (married): Rs. 2,000
- Child: Rs. 500 (max. 2,000)
Rates of tax chargeable after deduction of allowances are:

- 2½% on first Rs. 3,000 taxable income.
- 5% on next Rs. 3,000 then increasing by 2½% for each Rs. 1,000 of taxable income up to Rs. 15,000.
- Rs. 15,000–Rs. 25,000, 30%.
- Rs. 25,000–Rs. 40,000, 40%.
- All taxable income over Rs. 40,000, 50%.

Companies pay a flat rate of 30%.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1939 | 1,167,764 | 1,105,822 |
| 1950 | 5,025,346 | 3,240,903 |
| 1951 | 4,908,588 | 4,211,892 |
| 1952 | 4,739,138 | 5,902,141 |
| 1953 | 3,663,998 | 4,613,118 |
| 1954 | 4,118,498 | 4,203,290 |

In 1954 29.8% of revenue was derived from Customs and 29.2% from direct taxes. Repayment of the Public Debt of Seychelles was made in 1954.

### Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Notes of 1 rupee and 50 cents are however being gradually withdrawn from circulation. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling backed and worth 1s. 6d.

### Development Plans

A Development Plan for the years 1946 to 1956 is in operation for the building of new roads, schools, hospitals and clinics, housing, reaforestation, and health development, towards the cost of which an allocation of £250,000 was made from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The original ten-year plan is practically completed and further capital works are being financed from local funds.

Under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act a further allocation of £170,000 has been made towards development plans for 1956–60 to which the Colony also intends to make available the sum of £110,000.

### Education

Educational institutions number 46 in all, including continuation classes, teacher training, nurses, etc. There are 2,872 boys and 2,450 girls in the Primary schools and 189 boys and 229 girls in the Secondary schools. There is no higher education in the Colony. Twenty-five students are studying in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Government expenditure on education in 1954 was Rs. 795,375, compared with Rs. 27,528 in 1935.

### Libraries

There are no Free Libraries. Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust, and there are small libraries run by the Co-operative Book Society and the French Consulate.

### Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has almost none of the diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria and yellow fever are absent and filariasis infrequent. The incidence of leprosy is diminishing. Venereal disease is rapidly coming under control. An Intestinal Clinic has been started to reduce intestinal infestations. Apart from these diseases there is tuberculosis, which is rather more frequent than had been previously thought, and is also receiving attention.

Preventive medicine is gradually coming into operation in the Colony. It is proposed to separate the Public Health Section as from the beginning of 1956.

On the curative side the Seychelles Hospital (110 beds) is capable of dealing with most medical, surgical, maternity and eye cases, with the assistance of a fully equipped laboratory and small X-ray plant. Apart from Seychelles Hospital there are small hospitals at Anse Royale (Mahé), Baie St. Anne (Praslin) and on La Digue Island while out-patient clinics are held at Grand Anse (Praslin), Bcoifere (North Mahé) and Takamaka (South Mahé). Dental facilities are available daily in Victoria and once a week in Anse Royale (Mahé). Expenditure on medical services in 1954 was estimated at Rs. 590,356 or Rs. 15 per head of the population. In 1935 expenditure was Rs. 72,682.

### Communications

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 86 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet, earth-surfaced. Tarmac surfacing is in progress in Victoria and suburbs.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 55 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé, and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. British India Steam Navigation Company and Eastern Shipping Corporation vessels on the Bombay–Mombasa service call at Seychelles monthly from Mombasa and about seven times a year from Bombay. The Royal Intercean Lines vessels on the Far East–East Africa service call in both directions once a month. Direct loading cargo steamers from the United Kingdom call quarterly.

### Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and re-diffusion) station broadcasts nightly for one hour on a wavelength of 52 metres, 5,770 kc/s. with an output of 100/130 watts. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.
Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 20,000 are so employed. Other occupations are:

- Domestic service: 2,947
- Artisans: 2,380
- Public administration and the professions: 504
- Trade and commerce: 323

There are three registered Trade Unions—

   - Membership: 31
2. The Seychelles Building Trades Union
   - Membership: 168
3. The General Workers' Union
   - Membership: Nil

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

The livestock population is estimated at:
- Cattle: 2,000
- Pigs: 2,000
- Goats: 1,000
- Poultry: 40,000

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,000-1,500 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds' eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are as yet no true co-operative societies in the colony. Agricultural credit is available from the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. The Seychelles Copra Association, consisting of producers and shippers, is responsible for the marketing of copra. A Cinnamon Leaf Oil Association has recently been formed, which is especially interested in the marketing of cinnamon leaf oil, which is sold, through the Secretary of the Association, by a sole agent in London. The Copra Price Stabilization Ordinance, 1949, provides for a cess of 6% of the f.o.b. price of copra. These funds may be used to subsidize prices to the producer should world prices decline.
