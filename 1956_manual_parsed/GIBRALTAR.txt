GIBRALTAR

Geographical Features and Area

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, with an area of 2½ square miles. It consists of a long, high mountain called The Rock and a sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles and its greatest breadth nearly 1 mile.

Population

The population is European and at the Census of July 1951 numbered 22,848. At the end of 1954 it was estimated at 25,000.

Climate

The climate is mild and temperate; snow or frost is extremely rare. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in winter are 45° and 65° respectively. In summer a warm breeze laden with moisture, known as the "Levante," strikes the eastern face of the Rock, condenses in the sky above and causes a cloud pall to hang over the city and bay. During this period the climate is humid and relaxing. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in summer are 55° and 85° respectively. The rainy season is spread over the period September to May; the average annual rainfall is 35 inches.

History

Gibraltar was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain. It was held alternately by Moors and Spaniards until 1704 when, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke and ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779–83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

Constitution

The Gibraltar (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, three ex officio members, two nominated members appointed by the Governor and five elected members. The ex officio members are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary. The Order in Council empowers the Governor to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony with the advice and consent of the Council. The Governor possesses the usual reserved power to pass into law any measure necessary or expedient in his opinion in the interests of public order, public faith or good government (including defence). The Gibraltar Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions provide that the Governor shall be advised in the exercise of his powers by an Executive Council consisting of four ex officio members and three unofficial members. The ex officio members are the Deputy Fortress Commander, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

Taxation

This is mainly indirect. An Income Tax Ordinance was enacted in April 1952 and came into force on the 1st April 1953; the standard rate, for companies and individuals, is 2s. in the £. There are no excise duties.

The main heads of taxation are:—

Customs.
Estate Duties.
Stamp Duties.
Licences.
Trades Tax.
Fuel Oil Tax.
Coffee Tax.
The items subject to import duty are alcoholic beverages, perfumed spirits, motor spirits, tobacco, coffee, mechanical lighters, motor vehicles, motor vehicle spares and accessories, photographic cameras and cinema projectors, radio sets and spares, razor blades, watches and clocks.

The Government lottery yielded £100,564 in 1954.

**Communications**

There is no civil airfield in the Colony, but restricted use of the R.A.F. aerodrome at North Front by civil aircraft is permitted, subject to termination if military considerations so require. British European Airways operate daily services between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, via Madrid and Bordeaux. Gibraltar Airways operate a daily service (two flights) to and from Tangier.

The length of road open for traffic is 5½ miles in the city, 4 miles in the south district and about 3½ miles in the area of North Front and Catalan Bay. All roads are suitable for motor traffic.

**Broadcasting**

There is no wireless broadcasting system in Gibraltar, and those desiring to obtain British programmes listen to short-wave transmissions from the B.B.C. There is a local radio distribution service, operated by the military authorities for military personnel, which also relays programmes from the B.B.C.

**Principal Occupations**

More than half of the male wage-earners in Gibraltar, of whom a large proportion are Spaniards entering for work daily, are employed in one or other of the Service Departments, the Colonial Government, or the City Council. Commercial enterprises provide employment for a substantial number of clerical workers in shipping offices and trading agencies. Hotels, catering services, retail distributing trades and stevedoring are the other main sources of private employment. Other sources of employment are the main local industries—the processing of tobacco and the roasting and blending of coffee. There is also a fish and fruit canning factory.

At the end of December 1954 the total insured labour force was 19,198. There are 15 registered trade unions in the Colony with a reported total paid-up membership of some 3,554.
