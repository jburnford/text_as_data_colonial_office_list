SIERRA LEONE

Area
The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925, South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

Population
The latest (mid-1952) estimate of population was 2,005,000 (Colony 130,000; Protectorate 1,875,000). Twenty-five per cent. of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these, and about 2,000 Europeans and Asiatics, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

Principal Towns

| Population |
|------------|
| Freetown, capital | 70,000 (mid-1952 estimate) |
| Bo, S.W. Province | 15,610 |
| Kenema, S.E. Province | 4,000 |
| Makeni, N. Province | 7,500 |

Geographical Features
Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which reaches 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.

Climate
There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground. Most of the rain falls in the three months July-September. The mean temperature is approximately $80^\circ$, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately $10^\circ$, inland it is approximately $20^\circ$ on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25-30% inland.

History
The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government". This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

Constitution
That part of Sierra Leone administered as a Colony includes the Sierra Leone Peninsula, Tasso Island, Banana Island, and York Island, and the township of Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

Royal Instructions of 1951 provide for an Executive Council of four ex officio members and not less than four unofficial members appointed from among the elected members of the Legislative Council. An Order in Council of 1951 provides for a Legislative Council consisting of 32 members, including the Governor (who is President) and a Vice-President. There are seven ex officio members, seven members elected from the Colony districts, twelve members elected from the Protectorate District Councils, two members elected from the Protectorate Assembly, and two nominated members appointed by the Governor. This Order in Council contains provisions in connexion with legislative procedure which previously were included in the Letters Patent. It does not, however, contain the procedure for the election of members to the Legislative Council. This is now provided for in a local Statute, the Legislative Council (Elections) Ordinance, 1951.

An amendment to the Royal Instructions made in April 1953 vests the six unofficial members of Executive Council with the title and responsibilities of Ministers.
With regard to the Protectorate, in 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation of Chiefdoms in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities were vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations and from grants made by Government and by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board.

**Land Policy**

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding 50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

**Taxation**

There are three forms of direct taxation in force: income tax, poll tax, and local tax. Income tax is chargeable on individuals at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man is granted £300, and a married man £500 as an initial relief; there are allowances for children (up to four) up to the age of 16 years or so long as they are receiving whole-time education; and for life assurance premiums up to certain limits. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £ and a double taxation agreement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government. Poll tax is payable by non-natives at the rate of 4½d. a year and is offset against an individual's liability for income tax. A Local Tax Ordinance introduced in 1954 replaces the House Tax, formerly paid by all adult native males, by a Local Tax. This varies (with one exception) between 23s. and 30s. and within chiefdoms is paid at a fixed rate. In general terms payment applies to all adult male persons residing in each chiefdom and in certain cases to adult females also. Revenue from this tax is divided between District Councils and Native Administrations.

The two main forms of indirect taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duties.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | £886,149 | £910,077    |
| 1950 | £3,268,530 | £2,978,819 |
| 1951 | £3,850,713 | £3,904,374 |
| 1952 | £5,213,775 | £5,401,539 |
| 1953 | £5,418,153 | £5,269,095 |
| 1954 | £7,621,299 | £6,863,115 |

In 1954, £3,562,768 of total revenue was derived from Customs and £2,476,681 from taxes. In the same year, the main heads of expenditure were:

Development Schemes (excluding transfers of £704,347 to the Development and Education Funds from revenue) £787,696, Medical and Education Services £1,002,958, Public Works and Electricity recurrent £673,885, non-recurrent Public Works £505,322, Law and Order £352,039, Provincial Administration and the Secretariat £219,208.

The Public Debt at the end of December 1954 amounted to £4,822,207 (approximately £2 8s. 0d. per head of population) and comprises:

- Sierra Leone Government 4½% inscribed Stock 1955: £57,825
- Sierra Leone Government 4½% inscribed Stock 1955: £202,500
- Sierra Leone Government 4½% inscribed Stock 1955: £151,100
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1958–63: £570,000
- Sierra Leone Government 3% inscribed Stock 1968: £81,425
- Sierra Leone Government 3% inscribed Stock 1968: £49,157
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968–70: £2,030,000
- 2nd Instalment Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968–70: £1,680,000

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ½d. In addition bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. are now in circulation. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development Plans**

"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946 (and reviewed in 1949 when "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was published). The Plans provided for the development of Communications, Natural Resources and Social and Basic Services at a total cost of £5,000,000 in the ten-year period.

As a contribution towards this expenditure, an allocation of £2,600,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 was made.

The minimum amount which it is expected to spend on development (largely on works construction) in the period 1st January 1956 to 31st December 1959 is £7,622,195 as follows:

- Lungi Airport: £87,002
- Inland Waterways: £13,500
- Freetown Electricity Supplies: £49,912
- Provincial Electricity Supplies: £175,142
- Provincial Water Supplies: £238,179
- Roads and Bridges: £906,014
- Railway: £1,814,048
- Guma Valley Hydro-electric Scheme: £878,540
- Agriculture: £736,112
- Schools and Colleges: £1,665,276
- Hospitals and Clinics: £283,193
- Public Buildings and Housing Schemes: £717,000
- Fisheries Research: £56,277

£7,622,195

It is hoped to finance this programme from loan funds, the Development and Education Funds, and to the extent of £2,482,737 from the territory's allocations under the 1945 and 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. The allocation under the 1955 Act is £1,200,000.

**Education**

University courses in Divinity, Arts, Commerce and Education are provided at Fourah Bay College (University of Durham), Freetown.
At the beginning of 1954-55 session, 137 students were in attendance at these courses and 110 scholarships for higher education were awarded (38 for study overseas, 22 for degree courses at Fourah Bay College, and 50 for Higher School Certificate and General Certificate of Education courses at Fourah Bay College, Prince of Wales School and Bo Government School) in 1954. About 32 students were known to be studying in the U.S.A.

There are four Teacher Training Colleges and two Teacher Training Departments in the territory; 417 students, including 24 agricultural instructors, were in training in 1954.

There are two Government Secondary Grammar Schools, three Government Secondary Central Schools and 14 assisted Secondary Schools and post-primary schools in the territory; 4,369 students were enrolled in 1954. There is also an unassisted Secondary School, which had 253 pupils. Five Government, 249 assisted and 118 unassisted Primary Schools had an enrolment of 46,577 pupils.

The Technical Institute, which opened in 1953, had over 500 students by the end of 1954, enrolled in engineering, carpentry, commercial and other technical and vocational courses.

Literacy campaigns were conducted in 1954 by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in 36 chiefdoms, and 1,463 reading certificates were issued. The Bureau reported that since it opened ten years ago, 34,000 people are estimated to have attained literacy in one vernacular, while 301,000 books in five vernaculars (Mende, Temne, Limba, Kono, and Koranko), have been sold, 167,000 of them within the last five years of the period.

The Extramural Department of Fourah Bay College, the British Council and the Social Welfare Department organized adult education courses in various subjects.

Expenditure from all sources on education was approximately £861,139 in 1954 of which £141,256 was contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and £39,805 by Missions. In 1953 expenditure amounted to £38,518.

Libraries

Fourah Bay College has a library of some 12,000 volumes. The British Council maintains a subscription library of over 22,000 books and makes regular bulk loans of books and periodicals to the Protectorate. In Freetown there are also two small public libraries.

Health

In 1954 beds available in hospitals (including two Infirmarys and a maternity hospital) totalled 1,186 (Government 918, Missions 179, Mining 89). In-patients at Government Hospitals numbered 178,074. There were 31 Government dispensaries (excluding 21 treatment centres attached to the Endemic Diseases Control Unit) at which 115,418 new cases were dealt with. Special measures to control malaria and endemic diseases are undertaken by Government.

Actual expenditure on medical and allied services in 1954 was £446,241. By comparison actual expenditure in 1953 was £63,923.

Communications

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the only international airport in the territory and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Air Services are operated through Freetown Airport by Air France, Hunting-Clan/Airwork Services and West African Airways Corporation. They connect Sierra Leone to the three other British West African Colonies and provide a thrice-weekly service to and from the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe.

Air and marine navigational aids, and aeradio and meteorological radio services, are also provided.

The railway carried 1,158,000 passengers and 110,000 tons of freight in 1954. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 337. This mileage included a branch line covering a distance of 83½ miles. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 57½ miles.

There are 2,912 miles of road, 1,620 miles of trunk roads motorable throughout the year, and 1,292 miles of feeder roads.

Freetown is a port of British Shipping Registry, four miles up the Sierra Leone River and has one of the finest harbours in Africa; a deep water quay was brought into service during 1954 to accommodate ocean-going vessels. Smaller ports are at Pepel, Bonthe and Sulima. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines. Bonthe and Sulima are loading ports for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piasava. Passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and Palm Line, Limited, and to the Continent by Holland West Africa Line. A limited cargo service to the east coast ports of America is provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and the Barber Steamship Lines, and to South Africa by J. P. Holmen, Limited, and Elder Dempster Lines, Limited.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and Bonthe River to the south.

Broadcasting

Government operates a wired broadcasting system in Freetown which redifuses the B.B.C. Overseas Service and local programmes to which there were 3,754 subscribers in August 1955. In the same month the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 1,194. The operation and maintenance of the station is in charge of the Posts and Telegraphs Department while the redifusion programmes are arranged by the Public Relations Department.

There is no direct broadcasting at present but it is anticipated that a 5 kW transmitter will be in operation in 1956.

Principal Occupations

It is estimated that over half the population are engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups as follows:—Building and construction 9,808; mining 4,901; transport (road, rail and air) 5,004; maritime and waterfront 2,688; Army and Navy services 1,135; commercial and miscellaneous 5,709; Government and Native Administration
(excluding workers in other groups) 12,703. Smaller employers provide employment for an estimated additional 30,000 workers of whom a large proportion are domestic servants. The total number of workers in wage-earning employment is therefore approximately 72,000.

There were, at the beginning of 1955, 12 registered workers' unions with a total membership of 18,550.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piasava, rice, cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, cassava, benniseed, Kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: cattle 150,000, goats 25,000, sheep 10,000, pigs 4,000.

The main timber products are sawn timber, shingles, roundwood, firewood, charcoal and gum copal. Sawn timber is not available for export but small quantities of gum copal and charcoal are exported.

Inshore fishing by African fishermen is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown and the Protectorate. Two Italian trawlers have recently begun operations from Freetown.

The Headquarters of the West African Fisheries Research Institute are situated at Kissy, near Freetown. The Institute's two research launches are undertaking the survey of the Sierra Leone River estuary. Two other estuaries North and South of Freetown are also being explored for possible fishing grounds.

The chief minerals mined are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Small quantities of gold are also found. Production in 1954 was:

- Diamonds: 400,605 carats
- Chromite: 18,343 tons
- Gold: 238 ozs. (troy)

Other minerals known to occur in Sierra Leone are platinum, ilmenorutile, lignite, cassiterite and molybdenite.

Eight pioneer oil mills for the expressing of palm oil are operated by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board. An oil-expressing plant for the production of groundnut oil and palm kernel oil is being operated experimentally by Government. Government also operates two small and two large rice mills and there are a number of privately-owned mills. Connected with the Government rice mills is the complementary enterprise of pig and poultry feed production.

Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise.

Village industries include fishing, fish curing and smoking, weaving, and hand methods of expressing palm oil and cracking palm kernels.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up under Ordinance No. 1 of 1949, the objects being to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchase, marketing and export of Sierra Leone produce, and to assist, by all possible means, in the development of the agricultural industry in Sierra Leone and of secondary industries connected with it. To this end the Board has erected six pioneer mills for the extraction and processing of palm oil and two are in course of erection.

On 30th April, 1955, there were 189 Co-operative Societies, with 7,900 members and subscribed share capital of £7,300. Their surplus and reserves totalled £11,577 and their turnover during the year ending on that date was £139,000.
Societies issued short term loans to members during the year amounting to £18,850, of which £13,172 had been repaid by 30th April, the balance, plus further issues, being due for repayment at the end of 1955.
