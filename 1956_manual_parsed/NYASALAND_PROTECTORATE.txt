Principal Towns

| Town                  | Population (approx.) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Zomba—Administrative capital | 5,400                |

| Lilongwe—Headquarters of the Central Province | 3,400               |

Geographical Features
Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa, and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.
(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000-3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland, and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chilwa and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate

The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History

The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters, and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to “The Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa”; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September, 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to “The British Central Africa Protectorate” but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of “The Nyasaland Protectorate.” The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

There have been two internal disturbances; the Chilembwe Rising, in 1915, when an African pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges; and in 1953 disturbances in the Southern Province, attributed in large part to discontent over the African tenant system obtaining in privately-held estate land, resulted in the deaths of 12 Africans. In both cases rapid and successful counter-measures were taken.

Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 161). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council presided over by the Governor and comprising three ex officio members, two official members and two unofficial members, a total of seven.

As a result of changes to be introduced this year the Legislative Council will comprise 23 members, including the Governor. Three are ex officio members, eight are official members and eleven are unofficial members. Six of the unofficials are non-Africans and are elected on a non-African electoral roll by constituencies; the five African unofficials are elected by the African Provincial Councils.

Land Policy is controlled so far as African trust land, which comprises 87% of the total area of the Protectorate, is concerned, by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Order in Council, 1950; the Order in Council empowers the Governor at his discretion to lease trust land for terms up to 99 years, while the Secretary of State’s sanction is required for the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is either held in private ownership or is public land, which includes areas of state forest; the disposal of public land is controlled by the Public Land Ordinance, 1951, which empowers the Governor to make grants, leases or other dispositions subject to the provisions of any Order in Council or any general or special instruction of the Secretary of State.

Taxation

The Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of income tax and Customs and Excise duties on the 1st April, 1954.

Three forms of direct taxation are in force: non-native poll tax and native tax under Territorial laws and taxes on incomes and profits under the taxation laws of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In addition a “territorial surcharge” is levied on behalf of the Protectorate by the Federal Government under the authority of Nyasaland law on the income tax payable under Federal law. A non-native poll tax is payable by all non-native males over 18 years of age who are resident in the Protectorate. The rate of tax is £4 per year or £2 per half year. A native tax varying in amount from year to year is payable by all male Africans over 18 years of age. An automatic increase of a percentage of this tax is levied if the tax has not been paid by the 1st October in any year. The rate in 1954 was 17s. 6d. and the additional penalty 7s. 6d.
Public Finance

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938     | 842,410     | 810,260         |
| 1950     | 3,545,763   | 3,598,195       |
| 1951     | 3,863,601   | 4,030,910       |
| 1952     | 3,949,208   | 3,904,596       |
| 1953     | 4,894,613   | 4,424,804       |
| 1953–54 (18 months period) | 7,714,708 | 7,655,463       |
| 1954–55 (estimate) | 4,512,460 | 4,567,611       |

It is estimated that in 1954–55 £1,773,354 of revenue was received from the Federal Government, under certain constitutional provisions, as the Nyasaland share of Federal Income Tax. Other estimated main sources of revenue were: Taxes, Licences, etc., £797,240; Reimbursements from and services rendered to Federal Government £304,028; Interest, etc., £244,615.

In the same year the main heads of estimated expenditure were: Public Works £1,436,387; Police £312,340; Agriculture £302,358; and Education (African) £308,029.

The Public Debt at 30th June, 1954, amounted to £5,589,587 composed of the following:

| Source                        | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| Loan from H.M.G. (1945)       | 719,587    |
| Nyasaland 3% Guaranteed Loan   |            |
| 1954–75                       | 1,570,000  |
| Development Loan 4½% 1971–78  | 2,060,000  |
| Loan from H.M.G. 1952         | 1,240,000  |

Currency

Under the Federal Government's Coinage and Currency Act, 1954, the Central African Currency Board was set up. The first Federal currency was issued in November, 1955, but Southern Rhodesia currency continues also as legal tender for the present. British coins ceased to be legal tender as from 1st January, 1955.

Development Plans

The Nyasaland Development Programme, as revised in 1950, provided for expenditure of £12½ million over the period 1946–56. From 1951 onwards, increases in the costs of materials, equipment and plant, coupled with a temporary contraction in ordinary revenue, combined to slow down the rate of planned development.

On the introduction of the Federal Constitution in 1953, it was necessary again to revise and extend the Development Plan so as to extend it to 1957 and to divide it into the component parts for which the Federal Government and the Territorial Government were responsible. As revised, the Plan was estimated to cost £33,000,000, of which expenditure in the Federal sphere amounted to approximately £22,500,000 over the period 1946–57. Although the Plan was in fact a continuing one, it was convenient at this point to regard the first phase of development as being complete at 30th June 1954 and to plan for the period 1st July 1954–30th June 1957 in common with the other Governments comprising the Federation. Expenditure over this period was estimated at £11,600,000, involving a residual liability of £12,600,000.

During the financial year 1954–55 it was again necessary, at the request of the Federal Government, to revise the Development Plan to cover the planning period from 1st July 1954 to 30th June 1959. Revision was also required to take into account a new Colonial Development and Welfare Fund allocation to the Territory amounting to £1,000,000 which was authorized in April 1955. Over this new planning period development expenditure is expected to total approximately £13,000,000 of which £8,000,000 will be in the Territorial sphere and £5,000,000 in the Federal sphere.

Plans have been made for the expenditure of the new Colonial Development and Welfare Fund allocation of £1,000,000 over the financial years 1955–56 and 1956–57. Utilizing these funds a programme of road reconstruction, with emphasis on crop extraction roads, to a total value of £500,000 is envisaged and new schemes for European housing, African housing, land acquisition and social welfare services have been devised.

Various research schemes continue to be financed from the Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, the most notable being for agricultural experimentation near Lilongwe, a scheme for silvicultural research at Dedza, a scheme for the geological mapping of the territory and a pilot rice project in the south Chilwa Plain. A joint Fisheries Research Organization, administered by Northern Rhodesia in conjunction with Nyasaland, has been based at Nkata Bay and will shortly move its headquarters from Lake Nyasa to Northern Rhodesia.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation is developing an undertaking on the Vipya Plateau in the Northern Province for the production of tung oil. Prospecting for minerals is proceeding and continued interest was shown during the year in the monazite and pyrochlore deposits known for some time to exist in the Protectorate. A phosphate deposit was also investigated. The development of Nyasaland is, however, at present concentrated mainly on the expansion of the production of crops. Considerable attention is also being given to forestry development by establishing new plantations and re-afforesting cleared areas and by improved timber utilization and extraction facilities. Good progress is also being made towards the provision of minimum public utilities and substantial programmes for the development of electrical services and urban water supplies.

Consideration is being given to the implementation of the Shire Valley Project for the control of the level of Lake Nyasa, the production of hydroelectric power, and reclamation and irrigation schemes in the Shire Valley.

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July, 1954.

In 1954 there were 4,688 African, 11 Asian, one Coloured and five European Primary Schools in the Protectorate, accommodating totals of 238,657 African, 872 Asian, 130 Coloured and 557 European pupils. There is a Government African Secondary School at Dedza, where technical and commercial, as well as academic wings, are being developed. Including enrolment at other Secondary Schools, 709 Africans were pursuing a course of secondary education. European children generally go to Southern Rhodesia for post-primary education.
There are eight assisted and one unassisted Teacher Training Centres, in addition to the Government Teacher Training Centre at Domasi. They catered for 655 African teacher trainees during the year. During 1954 there were 22 holders of Government University Scholarships. Six of these were Africans, 14 Europeans and two Asians. In addition, eight scholarships financed by a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds were held during 1954, four by Africans and four by Europeans.

Expenditure on education for the year 1954 was some £517,517, including estimated expenditure by local authorities and voluntary agencies. In 1934 expenditure was some £67,000.

Libraries

Public libraries exist at Blantyre for both Africans and Europeans, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at the three secondary schools, and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of subjects and makes these available to study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health

Public Health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July, 1954.

The principal endemic diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread. Epidemics of smallpox rarely now occur. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, reappeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952, but has again subsided.

There are 19 Government African hospitals and one mental hospital for Africans in the Protectorate with accommodation for 1,245 and 150 respectively. Each hospital has a number of satellite rural dispensaries of which there are 93 in the Protectorate. There are also four Health Units. There are three Government European hospitals with a total of 39 beds. Accommodation for Asians is provided at various of the Government hospitals. Mission hospitals provide 790 beds inclusive of maternity beds.

Estimated Government expenditure on health in 1954 was £420,589. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £40,808.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial roads and other aspects of communications.

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and ten out-station airfields to which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Federal Director of Meteorological Services, and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre and Lilongwe. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation, and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways operate a twice-weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 289 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Province. At Chipoka south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. In 1953, 326,324 tons of freight and 355,969 passengers were carried.

The total road mileage is 4,852, of which just over 100 miles have a bituminous carpet.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing eight vessels. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

Monkey Bay–Chipoka–KotaKota – Likoma Island – Chinteche – Nkata Bay – Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika) – Ruarwe – Florence Bay – Deep Bay – Ngara – Kaporor (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

Broadcasting.

A small pilot broadcasting service was started in September 1953, but technical and other difficulties led to the station being closed down in December. Recording in the Zomba studio continues and arrangements have been made for the transmission of a daily half-hour programme from Lusaka (see under Northern Rhodesia). There are about 3,000 receiving sets in the Protectorate with an estimated average of eight listeners per receiver.

The Principal Occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, tung farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and cotton cultivation, retail trading.

There are six Trades Unions in the Protectorate with an aggregate membership of approximately 1,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize, millet, cassava, groundnuts, tea, tobacco, rice, cotton, tung-oil, and miscellaneous pulses.

Timber production in 1954 (excluding public land) was: softwoods 227,066 cubic feet, hardwoods 295,282 cubic feet, poles 252,394 cubic feet, firewood 2,799,542 cubic feet.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa but very little organized trade: fishery research is being undertaken.

The only mineral exported in any quantity during 1954 was kyanite.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of plywood, soap, cigarettes, and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of exports and imports.

* Including Government imports but not bullion and specie.

In 1938, 45·7% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 5·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 48·4% from foreign countries. In 1954 the corresponding figures were 56·07%, 22·24% and 21·69%.

In 1938, 90·6% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 3·4% to other Commonwealth countries and 6% to foreign countries. In 1954 the corresponding figures were 69·48%, 9·52% and 21%.

Statistics are not now available of certain commodities and products which are exported from Nyasaland but disposed of or processed within the Federation. The figures given for 1954 are therefore those of crops or products originating from Nyasaland which were exported to countries outside the Federation.

The chief imports are fibres, yarns, textiles and apparel; metals, machinery, vehicles and metal manufactures; oils, resins, waxes, paints, varnishes; foodstuffs.

The marketing of the principal cash crops grown on African trust land, namely, tobacco, cotton, maize, groundnuts and beans, is handled by three statutory boards (shortly to be combined into one board) whose aim is to ensure a steady remunerative price to the producer, to secure improvement of the quality of the product and to build up reserves. The boards help to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of an annual contribution from surpluses to the Native Development and Welfare Fund. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom and other extraterritorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1954 there were 66 co-operative societies, with 4,123 members and total paid-up share capital of £11,450.
