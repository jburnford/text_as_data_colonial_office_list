BERMUDA

Situation and Area

The "Bermudas" or "Somers Islands" are situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, about 580 miles east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina. Their total area is now 20.58 square miles, of which 2.83 square miles are leased to the Government of the United States for naval and military bases, leaving 17.75 square miles available to the civil population. The United States Bases include a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

Population

The estimated civil population on the 31st December, 1954, was 40,455, of whom 15,410 were white and 25,045 coloured.

Principal Towns

The City of Hamilton, now the capital, with a population estimated at about 3,000, is situated on the main island. The town of St. George on the island of St. George was formerly the capital of the Colony. Its population is estimated at about 1,500.

Geographical Features

The Bermudas consist of about 300 coralstone islands and islets, roughly in the form of a fishhook, along the southern rim of the oval plateau summit, about 22 miles from east to west and 14 miles from north to south, of a steep submarine volcanic mountain which is reputed to be between 14,000 and 15,000 feet in height. The ten principal islands are connected by bridges and form a chain about 22 miles long between its north-east and south-west extremities. These islands vary in width but the main island, which is about 14 miles long, has an average width of about 1 mile; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands and the areas reclaimed for the United States Bases aggregate about 4,280 acres.

Climate

The climate is generally mild and humid with a mean annual temperature of 70° F. and average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 90° F. and 47° F. respectively. The coldest and hottest months are February and August with mean temperatures of 62° F. and 80° F. respectively. The average annual rainfall is 58.1 inches. The climate shows very little variation throughout the Colony.

History

The islands were probably discovered about 1510 by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, but the Spaniards took no steps to form a settlement and the islands were still entirely uninhabited when in 1609 Admiral Sir George Somers' ship The Sea Venture was wrecked upon one of the sunken reefs while conveying a party of colonists to Virginia. The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was granted by King James I, in 1612 and the first emigrants went out in that year. Shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands", and thenceforward for a considerable time the islands bore that name.

Constitution

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled in 1684. Since then the Governors have been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature. Until 1888 this legislature consisted of the Governor and the House of Assembly and since then of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of three official and four unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of eleven members, three of whom are
official and eight unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 5,066 electors, the elector's qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240.

With the enactment of the Women's Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

Taxation

There is no direct taxation. The revenue of the Colony is mostly raised from Customs duties. The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 10s. 6d. on every £100 of real estate and personal property, plus 3s. on every £100 for those freeholders receiving sewerage service. The corporation of St. George's obtains its revenue in like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100. The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy rates, and under the Liquor Licence Act licensees pay a certain sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

Public Finance

| 1954 | 2,976,251  | 3,389,381      |

In 1954 £1,936,126 of revenue was derived from Customs duties.

Currency

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £1,164,896, were in circulation on 31st December, 1954.

Development

The clearance of dead cedar trees along the roadsides to a depth of 50 feet was completed during 1955, but the re-planting under the Reafforestation (Compulsory Powers) Act, 1952, of the cleared areas with suitable trees and shrubs is still in progress. The total cost of the operation from its inception to the middle of 1955 has been upwards of £178,700.

The efforts at local propagation of citrus plants, as an alternative to imports from abroad since the discovery in 1952 of "Tristera" disease in some of the citrus groves in Florida, were so encouraging that about 2,000 locally produced plants were expected to have been distributed to local growers by the end of 1955.

The Department of Public Works completed the construction of the new Passenger Terminal Building at Kindley Airfield and also the systematic improvement, which was started in 1911 and cost almost one and a quarter million pounds, of the Colony's navigable channels. The acquisition in April 1954 by the Bermuda Government from the Imperial Government of the former Crown Lands increased the departmental commitment by responsibility for the maintenance of five more miles of road, three bridges and four wharves, most of which were in varyingly poor condition.

During 1954 the Corporation of Hamilton completed the major portion of a street resurfacing programme.

Note.—It is considered advisable to give the number of courses rather than the number of institutions, as one institution may provide more than one type of course.

The approximate number of Bermudian students attending schools, colleges and universities in the United Kingdom is 25 and in Canada and the United States, 322.

Government expenditure on education in 1954 was £405,049, compared with £26,480 in 1934.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Bermuda Library, with adult, children's and music departments in Hamilton, has a branch in St. George and a distribution service to the schools of the Colony.

The Bermuda Government Aquarium with adjoining live zoological collection, which has recently been considerably enlarged and much improved, has a museum of local natural history and other exhibits. The Bermuda Historical Society also has museums in Hamilton and St. George containing items of local historical interest.

Health

The level of health in the Colony is high and Government services are chiefly engaged in preventive measures. The Public Health Department is responsible for the inspection of milk and meat, garbage collection and disposal, rat control, mosquito control, etc. It is also responsible for pre-natal and pre-school health services.

The King Edward VII Memorial Hospital is privately run, but receives an annual Government grant-in-aid, amounting in 1955 to £110,000. The Mental Hospital is attended by Government Medical Officers and Health Officers. There is no public hospital or Government medical scheme.

During 1954 total government expenditure on Health Services was £300,477 compared with £47,890 in 1935.

It is to be joined in 1956 by the Reina del Mar. The same company's "S" freighters with accommodation for a few passengers call at Bermuda approximately twice monthly outbound from the United Kingdom to South American west coast ports. The Royal Mail Line's Loch steamers call at Bermuda approximately once a month outbound to North American west coast ports and their "E" ships visit the Colony outbound to Caribbean ports. Occasionally inbound freighters of this Company call at Bermuda to convey cargoes of used British motor cars to the United Kingdom. The Montreal, Australia and New Zealand Line's inbound steamers from Australia and New Zealand to the United Kingdom call at Bermuda about four times a year to discharge refrigerated meat and dairy produce. Intermediate Cunard passenger liners call at Bermuda occasionally between United Kingdom and United States ports. Cargo and passenger liners of Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships, Limited, visit Bermuda about thrice monthly southbound and once monthly northbound between Canadian, British West Indies and British Guiana ports.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The only marketing scheme in operation in Bermuda is the "Planned Production and Marketing Scheme" introduced in 1949 to assist the growers of vegetables to find a suitable outlet for their produce. The growers taking part in the scheme contract to grow a specified acreage of certain vegetable crops. The Department of Agriculture agrees to purchase any produce from the acreage specified at guaranteed minimum prices. In addition to the produce grown on contract the Government Wholesale Agricultural Marketing Centre buys other vegetables, citrus fruit and bananas. This scheme has undoubtedly assisted the farming community as more farmers are applying to join. During 1954 purchases of agricultural produce at the Wholesale Marketing Centre amounted to £33,726. Receipts from the resale of this produce exceeded £33,737.
