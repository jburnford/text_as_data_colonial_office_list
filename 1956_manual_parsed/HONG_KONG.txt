HONG KONG

Area
The land area is approximately 391 square miles (Hong Kong Island 32 square miles, Kowloon 3½ square miles, Stonecutters Island ¼ square mile, New Territories (leased) 355 square miles). British waters comprise a rectangular area of some 738 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory and bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.

Population
The population of the Colony in mid-1954 was estimated to be 2,277,000, of whom the overwhelming majority are of Chinese race, many being British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. The number of Europeans and Americans permanently resident, excluding Service personnel and their families, is about 19,000, including some 10,000 British subjects from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, 3,000 British subjects of Portuguese origin, and approximately 6,000 aliens.

Principal Towns
The overwhelming majority of the population lives on Hong Kong Island or in Kowloon, each of which is estimated to contain about 1,000,000 people.

The principal towns of the New Territories are Tsun Wan (52,000), which has recently grown into an important industrial centre with large textile, enamel and rubber factories, iron works, etc.; Cheung Chau (20,000), a small but densely populated island, important as a market and fishing centre; Yuen Long (18,000), a mainland market town; Tai O (14,000), a fishing and market centre on Lantau Island; Taipo (6,000) and Sheung Shui (5,000), both mainland market towns; and Ping Chau (3,500), an island fishing port, with some industries.

Geographical Features
The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the North, together with some 75 adjacent islands ranging from Lantau with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria, the capital, on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.

The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside covered with dense scrub in some parts, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented.

A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain Taimoshan, 3,142 feet; Lantau Peak is 3,068 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,805 feet high.

Climate
The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59°F. in February to 82°F. in July. The actual temperature rarely
rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84.76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.

History

Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters' Island in the harbour, Aplichau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

Constitution

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of five officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of nine officials and eight unofficials, four of whom are Chinese and one Portuguese. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of five officials and 16 unofficials, eight of whom are elected.

Taxation

(1) Earnings and Profits Tax.—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:

(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).
(b) Salaries and Annuities Tax.
(c) Interest Tax.
(d) Property Tax.

The standard rate for 1955-56 is 12½% and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is normally only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries and Annuities Tax is levied on income from employment earned by residents of the Colony after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($7,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $5,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $45,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries and Annuities Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged at one-half of the standard rate (i.e. 6¼%) on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony.

Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax as is the case under Salaries and Annuities Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.

(2) Estate Duty.—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 2½% in the case of estates valued between $3,000 and $10,000, and 52% in the case of estates valued at over $30 million.

(3) Other Sources of Revenue.—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainment, Betting and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor, toilet preparations and table waters.

Public Finance

| Year   | Revenue HK $ | Expenditure HK $ |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| 1939   | 41,478,053   | 37,949,116       |
| 1950-51| 291,728,416  | 251,684,524      |
| 1951-52| 308,564,247  | 275,885,951      |
| 1952-53| 484,590,446  | 411,749,658      |
| 1953-54| 396,881,966  | 355,407,770      |
| 1954-55| 434,452,321  | 373,343,609      |

It was estimated that in 1954-55 $156,800,000 would be raised from direct and indirect taxes, $69,900,000 from Duties and $39,080,000 from Rates. For the same year the main heads of estimated expenditure are:

- Public Works: $110,306,487
- Police: $39,414,983
- Subventions: $36,960,325
- Medical: $27,843,553

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March, 1955, amounted to $56,452,320 (approximately $25.9 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:

- 3½% Dollar Loan (1934)—$2,600,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3½% Dollar Loan (1940)—$5,186,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3½% Rehabilitation Loan (1947-48)—$46,666,000 (Sinking Fund of $14,106,278).
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes—$667,200.

Currency

The value of the HK$, at approximately HK $1 = 1s. 3d., is kept stable in relation to the £ sterling by an Exchange Equalization Fund.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and to a small extent by two other Banks, and of $1 notes and nickel alloy 50 cent, 10 cent and 5 cent coins.

Development Plans

Over the next five or six years it is proposed to expend about $600 million on major development projects, $450 million of which will be provided from general revenue, $110 million from the Colony's Development Fund, and $40 million from loans.
The main items to be financed from the Development Fund are:

- Housing: $100 million
- Land Reclamation for industrial development: $10 million

The main items to be financed from current revenue are as follows:

- New Schools: $20 million
- New Hospitals and Clinics: $50 million
- City Hall: $20 million
- Piers: $10 million
- Waterworks: $120 million
- Abattoir: $23 million
- Kai Tak Airport: $105 million (including $48 million interest-free loan from Her Majesty's Government).

**Education**

In 1954 education was provided in 1,106 schools for over 234,000 pupils. This figure represents a little over one in ten of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:

- Primary: 169,000
- Secondary: 46,000
- Post-secondary: 8,000

Private schools provided places for some 143,000 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 62,000; while 40 Government institutions catered for 18,000. In addition there were special afternoon classes for over 12,000 pupils. There were 293 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies, including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $23 million as compared with $24 million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.

The University of Hong Kong has 844 students in the following faculties—arts, science, medicine, engineering and architecture. The annual Government grant to the University has been increased to $4 million and in addition, an annual capital grant of up to $3 million is to be made available by Government.

**Libraries**

Local libraries include an English and Chinese library at the University, a British Council library and a small educational library at the Education Department. Various clubs have well-stocked libraries for the use of their members.

**Health**

The Health division undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and the inspection and treatment of school children. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda, the registration of births and deaths and pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work.

The Government maintains and operates eleven general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to seven other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony nine private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups are 1,856, 2,111 and 994 respectively.

In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1954 totalled over 103,000, and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were just over 781,000. There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.

The general state of health is very good; there were no major epidemics during 1954.

The most serious scourge is tuberculosis; 12,508 cases were notified in 1954 with 22.9% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned nearly 3,800 deaths; infant mortality was 72.4 per 1,000 live births.

Government expenditure on these services during the year 1954–55 amounted to approximately $31.4 million, compared with $2 million in 1937.

**Communications**

Air.—Kai Tak Airport is limited in size by the geographical features of the neighbourhood, but international traffic continues steadily. Thirteen companies operate regular international flights through the Colony. Principal aircraft are DC-4, DC-6, DC-6B, Canadair 749A (Constellation) and Convair types. During 1954, 6,230 international flights by commercial aircraft carried 121,260 passengers, 2,339.1 tons of freight and 678 tons of mail, in addition to transit traffic.

Rail.—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1954 amounted to 119,218 tons, and 3,834,478 passengers were carried.

Roads.—There are 443 miles of roadway, 94% of which is of metalled construction.

Shipping.—80,078 vessels entered and cleared during 1954–55, their net registered tonnage being 27,345,059; 1,773,272 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. A frequent ferry service crosses the harbour and links the principal islands to the westward.

**Broadcasting**

Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW.) from two separate stations, in English and three Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 2½ kW. There were 44,159 licence holders at the end of 1954. A private concern operates a rediffusion service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1954 there were some 43,850 subscribers to the service.

**Principal Occupations**

Before the war, most of the urban population was engaged in commerce, but since 1948 there has been a significant growth of local industries. In early 1955 there were 115,500 workers in registered and recorded factories and workshops; 43,500 of them were women. Another 100,000 people are estimated to be employed in smaller cottage-type industries. Reliable statistics of
unemployment and under-employment are not obtainable; employment is liable to fluctuation during any year. Few rural families live entirely off the land, farmers' budgets being supplemented by remittances from family members overseas or working in urban jobs in Hong Kong and Kowloon. There is a large fishing population, most of whom live permanently afloat.

Figures for the main occupations are:

| Occupation                  | Number |
|-----------------------------|--------|

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are paddy, vegetables and fruit. The estimated number of cattle is 11,000 head and of pigs 60,000 head.

In 1954 39,510 tons of fish were landed, as against 31,439 tons in the previous year.

During 1954 the following were mined:

- Kaolin clay: 6,050 tons
- Iron ore: 90,800 tons
- Lead ore: 370 tons
- Graphite: 1,840 tons
- Wolfram ore: 60,340 lb.
- Molybdenum: 194 lb.

Cement produced for export and local use: 98,775 tons

Local industries are responsible for approximately 30% of all Hong Kong's exports, there being about 2,400 registered factories. The following figures show exports of locally-manufactured goods during 1953 and 1954.

| Commodity                  | 1953 Imports | 1954 Imports |

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are fifteen Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies with a membership of over 3,205. Fourteen of these Societies have federated and formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies. In addition two Irrigation Societies, two Salaried Workers' Thrift and Loan Societies, one Draft Animal Society, seven Fertilizer and Feed Purchasing Societies, one Fish Pond Society, six Housing Societies and twelve Pig Raising Societies have been formed. The last named have also federated and formed a Federation of Pig Raising Societies. Twenty Fishermen's Thrift and Loan Co-operative Societies have been formed and fishermen are gradually becoming aware of the benefits of co-operation. The total number of members of these Societies is 5,325.

The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market at Kowloon from co-operative societies and three collecting centres and two depots in the New Territories. The three centres are run by the farmers and are being encouraged to develop into co-operative societies.

Four Wholesale Fish Markets are now in operation, the latest having been opened in June, 1952, at Aberdeen, the main fishing port on Hong Kong Island. A revolving loan fund of a quarter
of a million dollars has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; over $2,200,000 has already been loaned from it.
