Geographical Features

The Gold Coast is divided into three main zones:

(i) A narrow belt of plains and scrubland, 5–50 miles wide and following the coastline. It includes the Accra Plains and is intersected by rivers and streams. Only three rivers have permanently open mouths, guarded by shallow river bars.

(ii) A belt of tropical rain-forest extends northwards from the coast, near the western frontier, for some 170 miles. The area is broken by ranges of heavily wooded hills, some of which rise from 600–2,000 feet, and is intersected by numerous rivers and streams navigable only by canoes. This area produces most of the timber, cocoa and minerals which play an important part in the economy of the Gold Coast.

(iii) North of the forest belt the country undulates gently between 300–1,300 feet, and is mostly covered by orchard bush with park-like areas and stretches of treeless plains. A range of hills runs north and south along the eastern boundary reaching a maximum height of 2,900 feet.

Climate

Considerable climatic variation exists within the area. On the average rainfall is least in January over most of the country except the extreme southeast. In the extreme north, August is the wettest month. Coming south the wettest month is progressively later in the year until it occurs in October with a secondary maximum in May or
June. About latitude 6° 30' N. there are two equal peaks in the monthly totals with a secondary minimum in August. Further south, the May or June peak becomes the more important and the October peak scarcely noticeable in the eastern coastal area.

There are only small seasonal changes in temperature but well-marked diurnal changes. Afternoons are hottest in March and coolest in August. Nights are coolest in January, except in the extreme north where they are coolest in December, and in the coastal areas and southern Togoland where they are coolest in August.

Relative humidities are usually over 90% from late at night until early morning in all areas except between December and March in the North when average values are only 30%.

Dry north-easterly winds (the harmattan) reach the Gold Coast in January and February. They frequently bring particles of fine dust from the deserts in the north and cause a haze, which may become so thick as to impede navigation on the sea and in the air.

**History**

The Gold Coast first became known through Portuguese navigators, who visited the country in 1471 in their search for gold, ivory and spices. They built a chain of forts and castles along the Coast and these served as their trading posts. The slave trade later attracted the attention of traders of other European nations, notably the English and the Dutch; and in 1642 the Portuguese were compelled to abandon their possessions to the newcomers. By 1750, all the other European nations had relinquished their settlements on the Coast with the exception of the English, the Dutch and the Danes, who had their headquarters at Cape Coast, Elmina and Christiansborg respectively.

In 1821 the Imperial Government assumed full control of the British Settlements on the Coast; and by a convention made in 1871 the Dutch, who then remained the only other European nation on the Gold Coast, ceded their settlements to the British.

The Colony of the Gold Coast was created by Charter in July 1874, and in August of the same year an Order in Council empowered the Legislative Council to legislate for the new Colony by ordinance. Even then the Colony did not include all the areas under British protection as the boundaries remained undefined. To regularize the position, therefore, these protected areas were annexed as a British possession in 1901 and the boundaries of the Colony were fully defined by Order in Council in 1906.

In the interim the eighteenth century saw the rise of the formidable confederacy of the Ashantis, who soon began to demand a larger and a more direct share of the trade with the Europeans. As could be expected, the Coastal peoples resisted their demands, and this led to a continuous struggle. Eventually, in the nineteenth century, the Ashantis came into open conflict with the English, who tried to protect the Coastal peoples. In 1874, after a series of Ashanti wars, Sir Garnet Wolseley led a successful campaign against Kumasi, the stronghold of the Ashantis. After a final struggle in 1900, Ashanti was annexed to the British Crown in 1901. In 1896 Prempeh, the King, was exiled and was only allowed to return in 1924. The Ashanti Confederacy was restored in 1935 and Prempeh's successor was proclaimed Asantehene (the Ashanti title for the head of their nation).

The Northern Territories came under British rule after the conclusion of treaties with the Chiefs in 1897.

In 1922 a portion of the adjoining German territory of Togoland was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as a part of the Gold Coast. This strip of land became a Trusteeship Territory after the formation of the United Nations Organization.

**Constitution**

The Gold Coast is administered by a Governor with a Cabinet of Ministers and a Legislative Assembly. Under Letters Patent which came into force on the 18th of June 1954, the Governor may appoint a Deputy Governor.

Under the Gold Coast (Constitution) Order in Council, 1954, which came into operation on the 18th of June 1954, there is provision for a Cabinet of Ministers consisting of not less than eight Members of the Legislative Assembly appointed by the Governor, acting in accordance with the constitutional convention applicable to the exercise of such functions in the United Kingdom by Her Majesty. The Prime Minister presides at meetings of the Cabinet, but at any special meeting summoned by the Governor the latter presides. The Prime Minister may charge any Minister with the responsibility for any department or subject other than certain subjects involving matters relating to defence and external affairs, for which the Governor is responsible.

The Legislative Assembly consists of a Speaker elected by the Assembly and 104 Members elected by direct election and representing seven municipal and 97 rural electoral districts.

The Constitution makes provision for the following:

(i) the appointment of Ministerial Secretaries from the Assembly,

(ii) the appointment of a Permanent Secretary in each Ministry and a Secretary to the Cabinet, who shall be public officers,

(iii) the appointment of an Auditor-General removable only by the Governor on an address of the Assembly, and

(iv) the establishment of a Public Service Commission and a Judicial Service Commission, certain provisions relating to which became operative from 31st July, 1955.
The Constitution contains provisions concerning the retirement of certain officers from the Public Service and for the grant of compensatory pensions or lump sum compensation to such officers.

**Land Policy**

In the Colony and Ashanti the land is owned by Stools*, families or individuals, except such as has been acquired by the Crown, mainly for public purposes. Grants by natives, other than customary grants, are subject to the provisions of the Concessions Ordinance, 1939, and subsidiary legislation made thereunder. In the Northern Territories the control of all land is vested in the Governor and all minerals are vested in the Crown. The vesting of rights in land in non-natives is therefore controlled by the Government. In Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, the law applicable to the Colony applies to the Southern Section, and the law applicable to the Northern Territories, to the Northern Section. In addition it is unlawful for any native without the consent of the Governor to alienate any interest in land to a non-native. In Kumasi, Accra, Sekondi-Takoradi, Cape Coast, Swedru and Sunyani all development is planned and controlled by statute. In other towns and villages development is planned and controlled by local authorities with the advice of the Ministry of Local Government.

**Taxation**

Income tax is levied on individuals, and on bodies of persons other than companies, on a graduated scale rising from 6d. in every £ of the first £400 of chargeable income to 11s. 6d. for every £ exceeding £10,000. The rate of tax upon companies is 9s. in the £, with relief for small companies incorporated locally during their first six years and for companies formally admitted as pioneer enterprises. Minerals duty is imposed upon the value of minerals won at rates varying with the profitability of the undertaking. Persons other than companies are exempt from this tax if they are engaged in winning diamonds or small quantities of gold only.

The estimated total currency outstanding at 31st March, 1955, amounted to £32,249,000.

**Development Plans**

The first Development Plan of the Gold Coast, which was approved by the Legislative Assembly in 1951, for commencement with effect from the 1st April, 1951, provides for a total expenditure of approximately £82 million; of this total £73 million is to be spent in the period 1951–56 leaving £9 million to be spent in 1956–57 in the completion of projects. The breakdown between the four sections of the Plan is as follows:

| Section                  | Percentage |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Economic and Productive Services | 18        |
| Communications           | 31        |
| Social Services          | 32        |
| Common Services          | 19        |

In the first four years just under £47 million was spent. The approximate estimated expenditure under some of the more important heads during the first Plan are as follows:

- Agriculture: 5,100,000
- Electricity: 1,750,000
- Urban Water Supplies: 3,900,000
- Rural Water Supplies: 2,100,000

- Offices, Staff Quarters, etc.: 8,400,000

* Symbol of a Chief’s authority.
Grants of approximately £4,000,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and £500,000 from the Foreign Operations Administration are being received. The Plan is kept under constant review by the Standing Development Committee of the Cabinet.

Other Development

Outside the scope of the Development Plan the two main items are the Volta River Project and the construction of a new modern port at Tema, 17 miles to the east of Accra. The former is a multi-purpose development scheme involving the harnessing of the River Volta to produce cheap hydro-electric power; the exploitation of the extensive bauxite deposits for the production of aluminium; the construction of the necessary road and rail communications to carry the bauxite to the smelter and the aluminium to the port; and possibly the provision of a country-wide electrical grid and the irrigation of the Accra Plains. It is envisaged that the scheme would be carried out as a joint operation by the Gold Coast and British Governments, and by Aluminium Limited and the British Aluminium Company. The public utilities in connexion with the scheme would be provided by the Gold Coast Government. The aluminium companies would be responsible for the bauxite mines and the aluminium smelter. Active investigations into the feasibility of the scheme have been proceeding since 1949 and at the end of 1952 the Gold Coast Government in consultation with Her Majesty's Government decided to set up a Preparatory Commission which would complete the investigations necessary to bring the scheme to its final form. The Preparatory Commission was set up in April 1953. Its report is expected in 1956.

The Gold Coast is short of adequate port facilities, particularly on the eastern seaboard. The construction of a new harbour at Tema near Accra, with road and rail links to the existing network, was begun in 1952. The first phase, involving the provision of four deep water berths, is estimated to cost over £14 million and will, in addition to normal traffic, meet the needs of the aluminium industry when required. The access railway from Accra was officially opened on the 11th May, 1954.

Education

In 1954 there were in the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories, excluding Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, 3,706 Primary and Middle schools with an enrolment of 459,834 (324,155 boys and 135,679 girls) and 44 Secondary schools with an enrolment of 8,185 (6,893 boys and 1,292 girls). Post-middle trade and technical institutions had an enrolment of 1,256 (1,120 boys and 136 girls) and 2,869 students were in teacher-training colleges (1,981 men and 888 women).

Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship had 429 primary and middle schools with an enrolment of 47,952 (30,857 boys and 17,095 girls); there were six secondary schools with an enrolment of 417, of which 4 were girls. Four teacher-training colleges had between them 403 students (340 men and 63 women).

The University College of the Gold Coast is entirely residential. It provides training for London degrees in Arts, Theology, Science, Economics and Agriculture. For this purpose it maintains Departments each under a Professor or Senior Lecturer, of English, Classics, Geography, History, Mathematics, Economics, Theology, Philosophy, Sociology, Phonetics, French Studies, Archaeology, Botany, Chemistry, Physics, Zoology, Geology and Agriculture, together with an Institute of Education and a National Museum.

Under a separate grant from Government, it administers a Department of Extramural Studies.

The number of undergraduates in residence is 349. These have been accommodated temporarily in buildings at Achimota while the College's Halls of Residence are under construction at Legon.

There is a College of Technology, Arts and Science in Kumasi with an enrolment of 676 students in residence. This College offers courses in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and courses in Accountancy, Surveying, Building, Secretaryship and Administration, Pharmacy and Agriculture. It has a Department of Teacher-Training which provides a two-year post-secondary Teacher-Training course as well as specialist courses in Art and Crafts, Housecraft, Music and Physical Education. In addition the College gives two-year courses leading to the Cambridge University Higher School Certificate Examination in Arts and Science and the London University Intermediate Arts and Science Examinations.

Students and trainees from the Gold Coast and Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship who were in the United Kingdom and Ireland on the 1st January, 1954 numbered 854. Of these 237 held Government scholarships, 27 held other scholarships, 105 were trainees on the Government artisan training scheme, and 485 were private students. In addition there were 121 students in the United States of America and a few in other countries.

At the end of December, 1954, just over 26,281 learners had passed the literacy test during the year and been awarded a Gold Coast Literacy Certificate and 8,671 literacy classes had been established in 3,165 towns and villages.

The comparative figures in respect of expenditure on education are as follows:

| Year | Expenditure |
|------|-------------|
| 1927 | £146,728    |
| 1937 | £290,553    |
| *1954–55 | £7,222,750 |

* Including Ordinary, Extraordinary, and Development Expenditure and higher education.

Libraries and Museums

The Gold Coast Government has entrusted to the University College of the Gold Coast the formation and development of a National Museum, the scope of which is provisionally defined as the achievements of man in Africa. The Professor of Archaeology (whose post was established in 1951) is Director of the National Museum, and the Department of Archaeology functions as its Research Branch, undertaking surveys and excavation in the Gold Coast as well as collecting antiquities and ethnological specimens. The collections are now housed and in part exhibited by the Department at Legon, in a building which is to retain a specialized museum for research and teaching. A large museum to contain more popular exhibits is being built at Accra and should be completed in 1956.

The Gold Coast Library Board, a statutory body established in 1950, provides public library services over the whole country. There is a Central Library in Accra, and there are Regional Libraries at Kumasi in Ashanti and Sekondi in the Western Region. Branch libraries have been
opened at Cape Coast, Koforidua and Takoradi in the Colony, at Ho and Kpandu in Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship and at Tamale in the Northern Territories. Lending and Reference Libraries, postal services, book boxes and mobile libraries are provided. The book stock numbers 130,000 volumes.

Health

There are three Schools of Hygiene (Accra, Tamale and Kintampo) for the training of Health Inspectors and Superintendents. The Medical Field Units organization makes surveys and initiates mass treatment of trypanosomiasis and yaws, is experimenting with antrypol in mass treatment of onchocerciasis and undertakes enquiries into the incidence of other endemic diseases, such as guinea-worm, bilharzia, leprosy, malaria, etc.

The principal causes of death through disease are malaria, pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis.

There are four central hospitals (Government) with specialist facilities, in addition to 27 Government, 10 Mines, 10 Mission and 10 private hospitals with a total of 2,660 beds and 378 cots. The number of beds is distributed as follows:—Government 1,783, Mines 462, Mission 238, Private 177. These hospitals are supplemented by 18 Government and 110 non-Government dressing stations in rural areas. Three Government health centres have been completed and are functioning. In 1953 there were 61,824 in-patients and 1,178,837 out-patients in the Government hospitals alone.

Estimated expenditure on medical and health services for 1954–55 was £4,133,392, including £2,096,702 for development projects. This figure may be compared with £298,810 in 1935–36, and £281,935 in 1925–26.

Communications

The International Airport at Accra is linked with the other international airports of Kano and Lagos in Nigeria, Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo, Roberts Field in Liberia and Abidjan and Lome in French West Africa by direct air routes.

This airport also serves the following international trunk routes:—

British Overseas Airways Corporation—United Kingdom.
Hunting-Clan Air Safari Services.
Pan American World Airways—New York/Johannesburg.
Air France and Union Aero Maritime Transport—French West Africa.
Air Liban—Beyrouth, Lebanon.

In addition to the international airport at Accra, internal aerodromes are provided at Takoradi, Kumasi and Tamale. These aerodromes are linked with the capital by internal services operated by the West Africa Airways Corporation.

The total railway mileage open to traffic on 31st March, 1955, was 549 and the track mileage was 670. The main line runs from Takoradi to Kumasi, thence to Accra, a distance of 357 miles; with branches: Takoradi Junction to Sekondi (3 miles), Tarkwa to Prestea (19 miles), Aboso to Adjah Bippo (2½ miles), Huni Valley to Kade (99 miles Central Province line), Dunkwa to Awaso (46 miles) and Achimota to Tema (16 miles). The main line and branches are 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. 4,803,051 passengers were carried during the financial year 1954–55 and 1,612,679 tons of freight.

There are 4,177 miles of roads maintained by the Public Works Department; bituminous surface 1,100 miles, gravel surface 2,847 miles. In addition a considerable mileage is maintained by Regional Organizations, Local Authorities and timber firms.

The chief port is Takoradi; there are smaller “surf” ports at Accra, Winneba, Cape Coast and Keta. During 1954, 7,326,292 net registered tons of shipping entered and cleared at all ports, of which 6,537,749 tons were handled at Takoradi.

Broadcasting

The Gold Coast broadcasting service run by the Government operates from Accra on two transmitters rated respectively at 1·3 kW. and 5 kW. Twenty-eight relay stations carry the Accra and B.B.C. services to 17,962 subscribers throughout the country. There are in addition 5,000 licence holders. Community wireless receivers are installed at 23 rural centres.

Principal Occupations

A large proportion of the population is engaged in agriculture, primarily cocoa and subsistence farming. Returns rendered by employers in 1953, which, however, cover only a part of the working population, show the numbers in the main occupations to be: agriculture, forestry and fishing, 31,069; mining and quarrying, 38,361; manufacturing, 12,641; construction, 46,595; electricity, gas, water and sanitary services, 4,761; commerce, 22,601; transport, storage, communications, 20,216; services, 48,085. Of the total of these figures, employment by Public Authorities accounted for 107,263.

There were 92 registered trade unions as at 31st December, 1954, of which 74 had submitted returns as at 31st March, 1955, showing a total of 53,831 paid-up members.

Main Crops and Products

Almost all agricultural production in the Gold Coast is carried out by peasant farmers, sometimes organized as communal groups. Modifications in the traditional pattern of agriculture are gradually taking place, partly as a result of experiments and extension work by the Department of Agriculture and partly as a result of social and economic changes in the country.

In recent years rather more than one-third of the world’s supplies of cocoa have come from the Gold Coast which is the largest single producer. Within the Gold Coast cocoa is the basis of the national economy; since World War II, exports of cocoa beans have averaged a little under 70% of the total value of domestic exports and about 92% of agricultural exports. Apart from a relatively small amount which is processed in a local factory, all cocoa produced is exported as
prepared beans. Production is entirely in the hands of individual agriculturalists whose plantations are mostly very small.

The main food crops are millet, maize, guinea-corn, plantain, yams, cassava, cocoyam, ground-nuts, cowpeas and rice.

Other relatively important agricultural products are palm oil and palm kernels, kola-nuts, coconut oil, copra and coconuts, and shea butter. Minor crops include rubber, coffee and bananas.

Palm oil and palm kernels were the most important agricultural exports of the Gold Coast until the rapid expansion of the cocoa industry supplanted them. There is a very considerable internal trade in pericarp and kernel oils; the oils are extracted by hand, and consumed over a wide area. They are also used for soap-making on a cottage-industry scale.

Livestock number:-cattle 430,200; sheep 464,300; goats 427,600; pigs 58,000; horses 6,000; poultry 2,526,000; donkeys 16,800.

During 1954 local production of livestock for slaughter numbered:-cattle 38,350; sheep 70,830; goats 61,340; pigs 3,650. This stock did not meet the needs of the country as regards meat and 65,984 head of cattle, 133,000 sheep, 110,636 goats and 253 pigs were imported.

A total of 276 horses were also imported.

Timber exports in 1954 totalled 12,591,300 cubic feet of logs, 5,212,000 cubic feet of lumber and 135,443 cubic feet of plywood and veneers.

Sea fisheries are a major source of food, contributing some 20,000 tons in a normal year. The fishermen, of whom there are about 50,000, work from dugout canoes. Species comprised in the catch include sardinellas, Caranx, tunny, shark, snapper, breams, drums, and threadfins. The catch is preserved for inland distribution chiefly by smoking and by salting and sun-drying. Fishing is also pursued in the rivers, particularly in the Volta and its tributaries. The catch is much smaller than that from the sea, but it is of value to inland districts.

Development of the industry is being sought through the introduction of motor fishing vessels, and of canning and dehydration for preserving fish.

Gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite are mined.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are two statutory bodies concerned with marketing, the Cocoa Marketing Board and the Agricultural Development Corporation. The latter handles any exportable surpluses of scheduled agricultural produce, defined as oil palm produce, copra and coconut oil, shea nuts and shea butter, coffee, groundnuts and bananas. These organizations ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to the producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, pay a reasonable remuneration to buying agents, spend money on research, and finance schemes for the benefit of the people in the producing areas. Both organizations have stabilization funds which may be used to maintain fixed seasonal prices.

At the 31st March, 1954, there were 448 registered primary co-operative societies with 39,300 members. The total distributable surplus for the year was £145,000. Savings and deposits amounted to £68,000, and capital and reserves to £582,000.
