Geographical Features
The island of Zanzibar is the largest coralline island on the East African coast and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. To the north-east at a distance of some 25 miles lies the island of Pemba. Both islands are low-lying, the highest land being little over 390 feet (Masingini Ridge).

Climate
The mean maximum temperature is 84·4° and the mean minimum 76·6° (Zanzibar Town). The warmest season is from January to March (average 82° to 86°) and the coolest, June to September (average 75° to 78°). The average annual rainfall in Pemba varies from 65 inches in the north to 92 inches in the south; in Zanzibar from 49 inches to over 72 inches, the maximum being recorded in the centre of the Island. There is no real dry season but the rainy seasons are well marked, being March to May in the south-west monsoon and in November and December at the start of the north-east monsoon.

History
In 1698 the Arabs of Oman captured Mombasa, where the Portuguese had built a fort in 1592. Thereafter the whole of the East African coast as far south as Cape Delgado, including Zanzibar and Pemba, passed from Portuguese into Arab hands. Seyyid Said bin Sultan, the founder of modern Zanzibar and of its clove industry, was elected to the Imamate in 1804 and transferred his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar in 1832, and during his reign Zanzibar became both politically and commercially the principal town in East Africa. In 1861, by an award of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India, the Imam's possessions in Africa became independent of Muscat and from that date Oman and Zanzibar have remained politically separate.

By an agreement in 1886 Great Britain and Germany recognized the Sultanate of Zanzibar over the islands of the coast (including Zanzibar and Pemba) and a ten-mile wide strip on the mainland.

In 1887 the Sultan handed over the administration of many of his possessions on the African continent to the British East Africa Association (later, the Imperial British East Africa Company). The Government of these territories eventually passed to the British Government when they became known as the British East Africa Protectorate (later, Kenya Colony and Protectorate) and the Uganda Protectorate. Zanzibar still receives the sum of £10,000 a year from Kenya for the rights which the latter exercises in the coastal strip.

In June 1889 Zanzibar and Pemba were placed under British protection by the Sultan, Seyyid Ali bin Said. The Protectorate was proclaimed in 1890 and the following year a regular form of Government was set up.

The present Sultan acceded in 1911. In 1914 the control of the Sultanate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, the offices of His Majesty's Agent and Consul-General and His Highness' First Minister being merged in that of the newly created post of British Resident who was appointed subject to the control of the Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate as High Commissioner. At the same date a Protectorate Council was constituted as an advisory body with His Highness as President and the British Resident as Vice-President.

In 1925 the office of High Commissioner was abolished and the British Resident was made directly responsible to the Colonial Office. Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted in 1926 in place of the old advisory Protectorate Council.

Constitution
The Government is administered by a British Resident who exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1924. The Executive Council is presided over by the Sultan with the British Resident as Vice-President and consists of the Heir Apparent to the Throne, four ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Senior Commissioner and the Financial Secretary) and three official members. The Legislative Council is presided over by the British Resident and comprises four ex officio, five official, and eight unofficial members. The unofficial members include three Arabs, two Africans, two Indians and one European.

In November, 1955, the following proposals were approved in principle: that the Sultan and Heir Apparent should withdraw from the Executive Council and that a Privy Council be established to advise the former; that three unofficial members of the Legislative Council should join the Executive Council; that the unofficial (representative) and government sides in the Legislative Council should be increased to twelve and thirteen members.

Land Policy
Under the Land Alienation Decree of 1939, subject to certain provisos, permanent alienation of land, leases exceeding two years, and mortgages, by Arabs or Africans have no effect without the consent of a Land Alienation Board. In certain of the more undeveloped areas of the island, mainly inhabited by the indigenous Africans, the land is communally held and, according to native custom, cannot be alienated, although this custom has given way to freehold tenure in some places where plantations of economic trees have been established. Throughout the plantation areas...
(west and centre of both islands) land is freehold and there is no other statutory qualification as to its dispossession. A good deal of land is, however, reserved under the system of quasi-religious dedication of Muslim law, known as Wakf.

Taxation

The principal sources of taxation are Customs import duty, clove duty and income tax. There is no poll or hut tax.

The Income Tax Decree provides for taxation on incomes of over £200 but exempts income from agricultural sources. The rate of taxation is Shs. 1/50 in the £.

Public Debt: a loan of £250,000 from the National Bank of India Finance and Development Corporation Limited for the new Zanzibar Electricity Scheme.

The main heads of expenditure in 1954 were:

- Agriculture £169,521, Health £240,860, Education £274,267, Provincial Administration £66,788, Public Works £367,999, Pensions £124,910, Police £117,355, Port and Marine £156,723.

Currency

The standard coin of the Protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Shs. 20 = £1) with the following subsidiary coinage:

- 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent (bronze). East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon.

Development Plans

Zanzibar has received grants to a total of £1,290,087 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts in connexion with the Ten-Year Development Programme. From these grants £862,913 was issued up to 31st December, 1954. The programme was revised in 1951 and since that time practically all the permanent recurrent expenditure has been taken into the Protectorate Estimates.

A new development plan was made in 1955 to cover the years 1955–59. This provides for total expenditure of £1,300,000 of which £909,000 is being found from Protectorate sources, the remainder coming from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, of which approximately £291,000 was carried forward from the Ten-Year Development Programme.

In the new five-year period 1955–59 expenditure, which is largely on capital works, is planned under the following heads:

- Agriculture: £271,000
- Education: £220,000
- Health: £137,000
- Communications (including Development of Ports): £287,000
- Housing and Urban Development: £100,000
- Miscellaneous (including new Government Offices and Urban Water Supplies): £262,000
- Reserve: £23,000

Total: £1,300,000

Education

The following schools are maintained by Government:

| Schools | Pupils |
|---------|--------|
| Boys    | Girls  |
| Primary | 41     | 9      | 8,089 | 2,588 |
| Secondary | 1     | 1      | 252   | 103   |

In addition there are enrolments in grant-aided schools (12 Primary and two Secondary) of 910 boys and 1,674 girls in primary classes and 199 boys and 83 girls in secondary classes. These schools are mainly for Indians, and include those run by various Christian Missions. There is a Muslim Academy for Islamic studies, and between 15 and 20 boys a year are sent to the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education for a four-year course of technical training. Primary education in Government Schools is free for Arabs and Africans. Teachers for the Primary Schools are trained at the two teacher-training institutions, one for men and one for women. Post-secondary education is not yet available in the Protectorate and students proceed to Makerere College, Uganda, or elsewhere. Scholarships are provided for selected scholars to go to the United Kingdom and to India.

European children usually attend schools on the mainland or elsewhere. They receive financial assistance from the Government, but have to pay a special education tax.

Expenditure on education in 1954 was £274,267, compared with £27,220 in 1935.

Health

Preventive measures include the normal controls on immigration, environmental sanitation (on which a large staff is engaged), anti-malarial control, the supervision of buildings, the maintenance of District Rural Units, District Maternity Units, anti-natal clinics and a School Dental Service.

On the curative side there is a large new Group Hospital in Zanzibar of 200 beds serving all sections of the community, and two General Hospitals at Wete and Chake in Pemba of 90 and 50 beds respectively. Government maintains a Tuberculosis Hospital of 40 beds, and a Leprosarium for 100 patients in Pemba, and participates with one of the Missions in maintaining a second Leprosarium in Zanzibar Island, and a Home for the Aged and Infirm with accommodation for 135. A substantial annual grant is made to the Zanzibar Maternity Association towards the maintenance of the Mwembelado Maternity Home of 11 beds.
The total expenditure of the Health Department in 1954 was £198,899 compared with £35,577 in 1935.

Communications

Zanzibar airport is situated four and a half miles from the town. It has one all-weather runway. Operations are restricted to aircraft with a maximum all-up weight of 44,000 lb. This figure is ample for the types of aircraft in use at present, but the construction of the runway and the adjacent terrain is such that extensions could easily be made. A new airport building came into use in 1952. Air Traffic Control and other services are provided. The airport is open during daylight hours. The total number of aircraft movements during 1954 was 3,766. The number of passengers handled was 30,622, exclusive of those in transit. Pemba Airport is situated approximately six miles from Chake Chake. There is an all-weather runway with a landing restriction of 33,000 lb. Only temporary terminal facilities exist at present.

Zanzibar has 210 miles of roads, of which 150 miles are bitumen surfaced; Pemba has 110 miles, of which 50 are bitumen surfaced. There are no railways.

Ocean-going vessels maintain regular and frequent communication with all parts of the world; 384 called at the port of Zanzibar during 1954, representing a total net registered tonnage of 1,558,102. Government steamers maintain regular weekly connexions with Pemba and Dar es Salaam. Coasting vessels, carrying both passengers and cargo, also maintain regular services between Zanzibar, Kenya and Tanganyika ports. During 1954 the number of coasting vessels entered was 386 with a net registered tonnage of 150,169; the number of native vessels entered was 3,414, with an aggregate tonnage of 113,194.

Broadcasting

The Government broadcasting service provides one and a half hour's programme in Kiswahili six days a week, on a wavelength of 62·5 metres. The power of the transmitter, which is situated at Marhubi, is 0·25 kW. The station is the property of and operated by Cable and Wireless Limited under an agreement with Government. It is estimated that there are several thousand receiving sets, most of them in Zanzibar Town. There is no licence fee at present.

Principal Occupations

A large proportion of the rural population is engaged in food production; paid labour is largely dependent on the Protectorate's two major industries, cloves and coconuts, and the processing and handling of their products. Agricultural labourers employed by Government number about 1,200. Fishing is also the occupation of a large number but they usually cultivate as well.

In urban areas, the principal occupations are transport, building, port and dock labour, domestic service, employment in sanitation and public works, clerical work, and business.

There are five employees' trade unions (membership over 900) and one employers' union (membership 10).

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cloves, coconuts, rice, cassava, sweet potatoes, citrus fruits, chillies, tobacco, maize and millet.

The number of cattle in Pemba is approximately 23,307 and in Zanzibar 9,666. The export of hides and skins is a useful item in the Protectorate's economy.

There are three small forests, one in Zanzibar and two in Pemba which yield a small amount of Mfuu (Vitex cuneata) and Mtondoo (Calophyllum inophyllum), while jackwood (Artocarpus integra) is a useful timber of the clove areas.

Fishing is an important activity and although most of the fish is consumed locally, small quantities of both fresh and dried fish are exported. Since the beginning of 1953 the Fisheries Vessel has been regularly at sea surveying the fishing-grounds and testing gear and equipment. A few privately owned, powered, small fishing craft are now in operation.

The only industries are the distillation of clove-oil, coconut-oil expression and the manufacture of soap. The manufacture of coir fibre and rope by hand is fairly extensive in the coastal areas, but most of the resulting product is at present sold locally. A few factories to process coir fibre have recently been established.

(These figures exclude bullion, specie, and transit trade.)

In 1938 14·66% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 39·53% from other Commonwealth countries and 45·81% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1954 were 27·84%, 44·77% and 27·39%.

In 1938 4·74% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 31·83% to other Commonwealth countries and 63·43% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1954 were 5·91%, 46·61% and 47·48%.

|                       | £000 | 2 | 466 | 410 |

The chief imports are rice and grain, textiles, motor spirit and petroleum, sugar, tobacco and cigarettes, flour, ghee, sesame, cattle, dried fish, jute bags, sacks and straw bags.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Clove Growers' Association, established in 1927 and incorporated by Decree in 1934, assists in stabilizing the price of cloves and distils and
markets clove oil. The Association also assists in the marketing of other products, for example, tobacco, chillies, derris root and cacao. It also provides many valuable services to agriculturists.

The Copra Board, established in 1950, administers the proceeds of a cess on exported copra products for the benefit of the copra industry.

There are 18 registered co-operative societies, including two co-operative stores and nine rural credit societies, the forerunners of a growing agricultural credit movement, but little progress has been made hitherto in the field of produce marketing.

MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS

Various islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory or under British protection but are not included in any colony or separate protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants.
The Territories of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland in southern Africa are administered on behalf of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom by a High Commissioner. The High Commissioner also holds the office of High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in the Union of South Africa. He is the sole legislative authority for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland and is responsible to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in much the same way as a Colonial Governor is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Each Territory is administered by a Resident Commissioner, responsible to the High Commissioner, and is divided into administrative districts in charge of District Commissioners.

Information about these Territories will be found in *The Commonwealth Relations Office List*. This brief note, and the following Civil Establishment list showing heads and deputy heads of departments and analogous appointments, have been included in *The Colonial Office List 1956*, because the staffs of these Territories are interchangeable with the staffs of the territories administered under the direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Biographical notes are included in the Record of Services section.

REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

A feature of British colonial policy is the encouragement of regional co-operation between Colonies, wherever practicable. In this way there is not only a valuable sharing of knowledge and experience, but also, in certain instances, a substantial measure of economy from the unified control of technical services. The following are the principal regional organizations.

CIVIL AVIATION

(a) British Caribbean Air Transport Advisory Council

The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation in the British Caribbean Area was abolished in May, 1954, and the Council was established in July, 1954, by the Governments of Barbados, British Guiana, British Honduras, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands, who meet between them the cost of its organization. It meets at least once a year and its membership consists of one representative of each of the above Governments and a representative of the United Kingdom who may attend as an observer.

The main functions of the Council are:

(1) To keep under review and to promote the progress and development of civil air communications in the British Caribbean area.

(2) To keep under review all matters affecting Governments which relate to Agreements with any operators of aircraft or air services.

(3) To serve as a medium for the exchange of views and information between members on civil air transport matters.

(4) To provide a means of co-operation on a regional basis with the United Kingdom Government.

(5) To consider and advise on such civil aviation matters as may be referred to the Council by the Governments of member territories.

There is also a Standing Technical Committee of the Council meeting at least twice a year. Its primary function is to advise the Council on technical matters and to obtain as wide a measure of common action by Governments as is possible to ensure that technical practices in the area, including airfield conditions, ground facilities, airworthiness, safety measures and international requirements, are co-ordinated and standardized. The members of the Committee are the Directors of Civil Aviation of each member Government, the Director of the British Caribbean Meteorological Service, the Resident Surveyor or the Air Registration Board and a representative of the United Kingdom Government who may attend as an observer.

Administrative Secretary of the Council—J. A. Marryshow.

(b) Central African Air Authority.

The Air Authority is now under the control of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

(c) East Africa.

The East African Air Transport Authority was set up by Order in Council in 1945, to control aircraft flying for hire and reward. The functions of the Authority were taken over on the 1st January, 1948, by the East Africa High Commission.

Following a meeting of the East Africa High Commission in March 1951, an Air Advisory Council was set up by administrative action pending the necessary legal enactment to establish the Council as a statutory body. The Council, which meets about twice a year, consists of the Commissioner for Transport as ex officio chairman, two members appointed by each of the Governments of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda and one by the British Resident, Zanzibar, and in addition two members appointed by the High Commission.

The functions of the Council are:

(i) to be advisory to the East Africa High Commission, whose authority is exercised through the Commissioner for Transport;

(ii) to advise on all questions of major policy affecting Civil Aviation within the jurisdiction of the East Africa High Commission and on any civil aviation matters referred to it by the East Africa High Commission acting through the Commissioner for Transport;

(iii) to advise on the Annual Estimates of the Directorate of Civil Aviation before they are submitted to the Central Legislative Assembly and the Estimates Committee of the Central Legislative Assembly;

(iv) to advise on all Civil Aviation legislation coming within the scope of the Central Legislative Assembly;

(v) to advise on the steps necessary to achieve a policy of co-ordination between Civil Aviation and all other forms of transport.

Director of Civil Aviation, East Africa—Comdr. S. W. D. Colls, A.F.C., R.N. (ret.).

(d) West African Air Transport Authority.

The Authority was set up under the West African Territories (Air Transport) Order in Council, 1946, to control aircraft flying for hire and reward. It meets about twice a year and membership consists of the Officer administering the Government of the Federation of Nigeria as President; the Chief Secretary, West African Inter-Territorial Secretariat; and one member nominated by each of the four West African territories.

Director of Civil Aviation, West Africa—Wing Comdr. E. H. Coleman, A.F.C.

(e) South-East Asia and Hong Kong.

The Commissioner-General's Conference decided in 1955 to become directly responsible for the co-ordination of civil aviation activities in the South-East Asia/Hong Kong region and abolished the Air Transport Council, whose functions it had, in fact, been discharging.

These functions are:

(i) to keep under review the general development of Civil Air Communications in South-East Asia and between South-East Asia and Hong Kong;
(ii) to co-ordinate air transport policy for the region and to co-ordinate and promote the orderly and economic development of trunk, regional, and local air services by British interests, within the framework of the general policy which may from time to time be agreed between the United Kingdom and the other Governments concerned;

(iii) to consider and advise on such matters relating to civil aviation in the region as any member Government may desire to refer to the Conference;

(iv) to serve as a medium for the exchange of information and views on civil aviation matters affecting the region;

(v) to provide a link between the United Kingdom and British territories in the region in matters of mutual interest in the field of civil aviation.

The Conference, which is attended by the High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya and the Governors of Hong Kong, Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo, normally meets at six-monthly intervals under the chairmanship of the Commissioner-General, South-East Asia.

The Air Transport Advisory Committee, set up in 1952, continues to function and advises the Commissioner-General's Conference on matters affecting civil aviation in the region. This Committee now consists of the Director-General of Civil Aviation, Singapore, the Directors of Civil Aviation, Hong Kong, Federation of Malaya and British Borneo territories, and the Civil Aviation Adviser to the Commissioner-General, who is also Secretary. The Civil Aviation Adviser is at present an official seconded from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.

A new Committee, entitled the Directors of Civil Aviation Committee (Malaya/Borneo) was established in 1955, after the Director-General of Civil Aviation, Singapore, ceased to have direct responsibility for matters affecting the whole Malaya/Borneo region. This new Committee, which consists of the Director-General of Civil Aviation, Singapore, and the Directors of Civil Aviation in the Federation of Malaya and the British Borneo territories, is now responsible for co-ordinating the development of civil aviation in the Malaya/Borneo territories, subject, of course, to reference to the Governments concerned.

DEVELOPMENT AND WELFARE ORGANIZATION IN THE WEST INDIES AND BRITISH SECTION, CARIBBEAN COMMISSION

This Organization was set up in 1940, as a result of the recommendations of the West India Royal Commission (Cmd. 6607); its primary function is to work out, in collaboration with local governments, long-term programmes of social reform and schemes of development and welfare for which grants from United Kingdom funds under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts might be recommended. The Comptroller, who has a staff of experts in various subjects, also advises the Secretary of State on individual applications for assistance under the Acts.

The Organization provides expert technical advice to the Secretary of State and the Colonial Governments as necessary on matters not covered by the Development and Welfare Acts. It also acts as a centre for regional conferences on economic and technical projects, and in various other ways functions as a co-ordinating secretariat.

The Comptroller is United Kingdom Co-Chairman of the Caribbean Commission (see under International Co-operation, page 256). The British Section of the Commission shares a joint secretarial staff with the Organization.

In 1955, a Plan for a British Caribbean Federation (Cmd. No. 8895) having been accepted by the Legislatures of Barbados, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands, the Comptroller, Sir Stephen Luke, was designated Commissioner for the preparation of the Federal Organization.

The present Comptroller and his Labour Adviser are Chairman and Deputy Chairman respectively of the British West Indies Regional Labour Board, which is the body responsible for the programme of employment of British West Indies agricultural workers on contract in the United States of America.

The office of the Organization is at Hastings House, St. Michael 18, Barbados. The Comptroller's Annual Report for 1954, Col. No. 320, 1955 may be obtained from Her Majesty's Stationery Office.

The East African Directorate of Training and the East African Refugee Administration completed their tasks and ceased to operate in 1949 and 1951 respectively. The administration of the East African Inter-territorial Languages (Swahili) Committee was taken over by Makerere College in 1952. The East African Publicity Committee has not been formed.

In 1948 the following additional services fell, upon their formation, within the administrative sphere of the High Commission:

The East African Railways and Harbours Administration.
The East African Literature Bureau.
The Desert Locust Survey.

On the 1st January, 1948, the East African Research Services included:

(a) The East African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organization.
(b) The East African Veterinary Research Organization.
(c) The East African Fishery Research Organization.
(d) The East African Industrial Research Board.

Since that date the following Research and Scientific Services have been added:

The East African Customs and Excise Department was formed as a High Commission service, with effect from 1st January, 1949. The East African Naval Force was formed on the 1st July, 1950, and was constituted the Royal East African Navy on the 26th May, 1952. In 1950 the Desert Locust Control became a separate service under the High Commission. The East African Posts and Telegraphs Department was re-designated the East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration with effect from the 1st October, 1951. The Accountant General's Office was established on the 1st April, 1953.

Under the Order in Council the following services will also be administered by the High Commission upon their formation:

The East African Information Office.
The East African Radio-communications Service.
The East African Regional Geological Survey.
The East African Regional Topographical Survey.

Inter-territorial Services financed, in whole or part, by means of grants made to the High Commission from the East African Regional Allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.

Such further Research Services as may be set up on an East African basis.

The East Africa Central Legislative Assembly was established by the East Africa (High Commission) Order in Council, 1947, for a period of four years from the 1st January, 1948. The Order in Council has since been amended to extend the life of the Central Legislative Assembly.

The Assembly is presided over by a Speaker and consists of seven ex officio members who are officers in the High Commission Service, three nominated official members (one from each territory) and 13 unofficial members, one elected by the members of the Legislative Council of Kenya, and respectively, one elected by the unofficial members of the Legislative Councils of Tanganyika and Uganda, one European, one Asian and one African member appointed by the Governor of each territory (in Kenya the European and Asian members are elected by the European and Asian members respectively of the Legislative Council) and one Arab member appointed by the High Commission. The Assembly held its first meeting in April 1948, and normally holds three meetings in an annual Session.

The High Commission has power to legislate, with the advice and consent of the Assembly, in respect of and in connexion with, the inter-territorial services. It also has power to legislate with the advice and consent of the Legislative Councils of the three territories on any matter concerned with the peace, order and good government of the Territories. It has power to appoint
such advisory and consultative bodies as it may think fit in respect of any matter which is subject to the control of the High Commission or is of common interest to the territories; in 1954 there were twenty-two such bodies.

The establishment of the High Commission has involved no change in the constitution or administrative responsibilities of the Governments of the three Territories, which remain responsible for the basic services such as administration, police, health, education, agriculture, animal health, forestry, labour, housing and public works.

The East African Railways and Harbours Administration and the East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration are self-contained and self-financing services. The revenue of the High Commission, from which its other services are financed, is derived from contributions in agreed proportions by the three East African Governments, also by the Government of Zanzibar and certain other Governments for which services are performed, and by Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom which makes substantial contributions to the Research and other Services from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. The whole of the expenditure is controlled by the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly.

RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC SERVICES

RESEARCH SERVICES

The Research Services administered by the High Commission at present are arranged in the following six principal divisions:

East African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organization incorporating the former East African Agricultural Research Institute at Amani in Tanganyika, and including inter alia the East African Herbarium, Nairobi; and attached schemes for Termite Research and Training in Ecology. The organization is responsible for research on certain aspects of animal industry in addition to agriculture and forestry. New headquarters shared with the East African Veterinary Research Organization have been established at Muguga within easy reach of Nairobi.

The East African Veterinary Research Organization is responsible for research on animal diseases and other aspects of animal industry.

The East African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Research and Reclamation Organization of the East Africa High Commission has four branches: tsetse research based on Shinyanga with sub-stations in each of the East African territories; trypanosomiasis research, animal and human, based on Sukulu in Uganda with a sub-station (Inde) in Tanganyika; practical and experimental reclamation in the three territories; the headquarters are in Nairobi.

The East African Fisheries Research Organization is in two sections, one for the fisheries of inland waters with headquarters at Jinja in Uganda, the other for marine fisheries at Zanzibar—the East African Marine Fisheries Research Organization.

The East African Industrial Research Board has headquarters in Nairobi and is at present concerned with research on secondary industries, but plans exist for establishing an East African Scientific and Industrial Research Organization which will incorporate the Industrial Research Board and will have wider functions.

The medical research division includes the East African Leprosy Research Centre at Itesio in Kenya, the Virus Research Institute at Entebbe in Uganda, the Medical Survey based on Mwanza in Tanganyika and the Institute of Malaria and Vector-borne Diseases at Amani in Tanganyika.

SCIENTIFIC SERVICES

The Scientific Services include some research among their functions and are as follows:

The East African Statistical Department has headquarters in Nairobi and branches are established at the seats of Territorial Governments.

The East African Meteorological Department has its Headquarters and Central Forecast Organization at Nairobi and maintains Regional Headquarters at Dar es Salaam and Entebbe. It is responsible for the maintenance and study of meteorological records in all parts of East Africa and for weather forecasting, for aviation and other uses.

The Lake Victoria Fisheries Service has headquarters at Kisumu in Kenya and is responsible for the development and control of the fisheries of Lake Victoria, which are shared by the three High Commission Territories.

The Desert Locust Survey has headquarters in Nairobi, but maintains field units in territories to the north of East Africa, keeping close watch and conducting investigations in the areas.

Desert Locust Control operates in East Africa and also in the same territories in which the Desert Locust Survey maintains field units.

OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER-GENERAL FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA

COMMISSIONER-GENERAL—Sir Robert Heatlie Scott, K.C.M.E., C.B.E.
Private Secretary—Lt.-Col. J. A. McKay.
Deputy Commissioner-General—A. M. MacKintosh.
Principal Assistant Secretary—Brig. N. D. Wingrove, C.B.E.

As part of His late Majesty's Government's post-war policy in South-East Asia, a Governor-General was appointed with responsibility for the
co-ordination of policy and administration in an area including the Malayan Union, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and the Protected State of Brunei. This appointment was announced in Cmd. 6724 in January, 1946, and had been foreshadowed in a statement in the House of Commons on the 10th October, 1945. Mr. Malcolm MacDonald assumed duty in this appointment in May, 1946. At first his area of authority included only the Malayan Union, Singapore and Brunei, but on the conclusion of negotiations with the Rajah of Sarawak and the British North Borneo Chartered Company, it was extended to the new Colonies of Sarawak and North Borneo. The Governor-General had co-ordinating, but no direct administrative, functions and power to convene conferences of Governors. In respect of Brunei the Governor-General acted as the channel of communication between the Secretary of State and the Resident. In defence matters, the Governor-General was chairman of the British Defence Co-ordination Committee, Far East, on which sat the Commanders-in-Chief of the Services and the Special Commissioner (see below), and on which the Governor-General represented the interests of the territories in his area of authority and also those of Hong Kong.

In 1946 a Special Commissioner (Lord Killearn) responsible to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had been appointed with Headquarters in Singapore, charged with the responsibility for advising His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom on general problems affecting the conduct of foreign affairs in an area which included Burma, Siam, French Indo-China and the Netherlands East Indies, and with the special duty of improving the production and distribution of food supplies in the area.

Towards the end of 1947, His Majesty's Government came to the decision that, without diminishing in any way the scope of the two organizations, it would be possible to place them under one head, and to combine to a certain extent their clerical and administrative staffs. Accordingly, on Lord Killearn's retirement, the supervision of the two organizations was entrusted on 1st May, 1948, to Mr. Malcolm MacDonald with the title of "Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom in South-East Asia". The Commissioner-General has the same responsibilities towards the Federation of Malaya, and the Colonies of Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo, as he had as Governor-General. His direct administrative responsibilities in respect of Brunei lapsed when, on 1st May, 1948, the Governor of Sarawak was appointed High Commissioner for Brunei: his other responsibilities in respect of Brunei remain. Mr. MacDonald was succeeded in September, 1955, by Sir Robert Scott.

The Commissioner-General's organization, with its headquarters in Singapore, has now been reorganized as a United Kingdom Office, staffed in the main by United Kingdom-based officers and paid for by United Kingdom funds. The salaries of officers seconded from the Malayan or Borneo Governments will, however, continue to be paid by those Governments. The Commissioner-General is now responsible to the Prime Minister in the carrying out of the duties previously performed by the Special Commissioner, and not, as before the appointment of Sir Robert Scott, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

WEST AFRICAN INTER-TERRITORIAL COUNCIL

The West African Inter-Territorial Conference was set up in 1951, following the dissolution of the West African Council. At the second meeting of the Conference in June, 1953, it was agreed that the title of the Conference should be changed to the West African Inter-Territorial Council, that the Governor of Nigeria should be the permanent President of the Council, and that a Chairman should be appointed for each meeting of the Council by the Government of the host Territory for that meeting.

The functions of the Council are as follows:

(a) to receive from the Secretariat a report on inter-territorial collaboration on research matters and to review the progress made thereon;

(b) to receive from the Secretariat a report on inter-territorial collaboration in other social and economic matters as expressed in reports of conferences held during the previous year or in other convenient form and to make recommendations thereon;

(c) to consider international collaboration on matters covered by (a) and (b) and to make recommendations thereon;

(d) to consider the estimates for the West African Inter-Territorial Secretariat;

(e) to consider any other matters referred to it by any West African Government.

The duties of the West African Inter-Territorial Secretariat, which continues to serve the Council, remain unchanged, and include in particular those of fostering international collaboration with non-British territories in West Africa, organizing inter-territorial collaboration on technical subjects, supervising the administration of joint research services and co-ordinating the military and civil aspects of West African defence. The costs of the organization are borne by the four West African Governments, and its headquarters are at Accra, Gold Coast.

Also administered by the Secretariat is the West African Standing Advisory Committee for Agriculture Research which has been established to co-ordinate the research policies of the West African governments and to provide advice and liaison on matters pertaining to agricultural research. (Secretary—A. Pickles.)

Chief Secretary—S. J. E. Southgate.
Administrative Officer I—L. G. Heptinstall.
Administrative Officer II—P. A. Grier.

The research programme of the Institute includes the carrying out of a fundamental study of the oil palm as a plant, the determination of the most efficient means of cultivating oil palms, selection and breeding for improved seed and the study of improved methods of processing oil palm fruit for the production of palm oil and palm kernels.

Director—C. W. S. Hartley.
Deputy Director—(Vacant).

The West African Institute for Social and Economic Research was set up in 1950 on the recommendation of the Colonial Social Science Research Council to undertake and co-ordinate social and economic research in the British West African territories. The Institute is attached to the University College, Ibadan, where it has its headquarters. It is at present controlled by an Executive Committee composed of the Heads of the Departments of History, Geography and Social Medicine. Although the main activities of the Institute are in Nigeria, it works in collaboration with the University College of the Gold Coast.

Director—The Principal, University College, Ibadan (Acting).

The West African Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research which was formally opened in 1951, undertakes research into all aspects of human and animal trypanosomiasis and is designed to serve the needs of Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and the Gambia.

The work of the Institute is divided between two centres in the Northern Region of Nigeria, Vom and Kaduna. Investigations are not confined to the Institute or to Nigeria; they embrace the other West African territories.

Director—T. A. M. Nash, O.B.E.
Deputy Director—(Vacant).

The West African Maize Rust Research Unit, which was established in 1952 at Ibadan, Western Region of Nigeria, and which is administered by the Federal Government of Nigeria, is engaged in research into the pests and disease problems in maize. Investigations are being made into the use of hybrid seed with a greatly increased yield and into climate and plant disease epidemics in West Africa.

Officer-in-Charge—W. R. Stanton.

The West African Rice Research Station, which was established at Rokupr, in 1949, is administered by the Government of Sierra Leone. The research programme includes the study of the fertility of rice nurseries, the multiplication of pure seed and the introduction and trial of rices from other countries. Detailed investigation of the problems associated with the empoldering of estuarine and riverain soils is being undertaken. The station is at present under the direction of the Sierra Leone Department of Agriculture.

The West African Timber-Borer Research Unit was established in 1953 at Kumasi and is administered by the Government of the Gold Coast. The unit concentrates on the problems of ambrosia beetles (pin hole borers) in logs and lumber and on the control of damage by other insects to timber trees and sawmill stock.

Officer-in-Charge—W. E. Webb.
INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION

THE UNITED NATIONS

Her Majesty's Government are constitutionally responsible for the conduct of the international relations of Colonial territories and accordingly the interests of the Colonies are represented by the United Kingdom at the United Nations. Whenever the interests of Colonial territories are affected, the Governments concerned are consulted by Her Majesty's Government before acceding to an international agreement on their behalf.

In some of the Specialized Agencies, namely the International Telecommunications Union, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization, Colonial Governments can be separately represented as associate members.

The Malaya and British Borneo group (consisting of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei) and Hong Kong are associate members of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

Apart from the participation of Colonies directly in the work of those of the Specialized Agencies which permit it, Her Majesty's Government also, when appropriate, includes Colonial Representatives in United Kingdom delegations.

The United Kingdom Representative on the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations is Sir Alan Burns, G.C.M.G., formerly Governor of the Gold Coast. He will be succeeded during 1956 by Sir John Macpherson, G.C.M.G., formerly Governor-General of the Federation of Nigeria.

AFRICA

At a meeting in Paris in January 1950, representatives of the Governments of Belgium, France, Portugal, Southern Rhodesia, the Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom agreed to set up a Commission for Technical Cooperation in Africa South of the Sahara (C.C.T.A.). Though membership is at present restricted to the six founding governments (Southern Rhodesia having been replaced by the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland), provision has been made for the admission of other countries south of the Sahara and also for the attendance of representatives from other countries or international organizations at meetings of the Commission and at technical conferences.

CARIBBEAN

The Caribbean Commission was set up in 1946, and has its headquarters in Trinidad. It is a joint body representative of the Governments of France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, for the purpose of encouraging and strengthening social and economic co-operation between the Caribbean territories for which those Governments have responsibilities, and co-ordinating research in these fields. (See Cmd. 8375, paragraphs 336-344).

SOUTH PACIFIC

A regional Commission for the South Pacific was established in 1947 by agreement between the Governments of Australia, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and it meets twice each year. This Commission is a consultative and advisory body to the participating Governments in matters affecting the economic and social development of non-self-governing territories within its scope and the well-being and advancement of their peoples.

SOUTH-EAST ASIA

All the British dependent territories in South-East Asia (with the exception of the small protected State of Brunei) participated in the preparation of the Colombo Plan for Co-operative Economic Development in South and South-East Asia, and are eligible for assistance under the technical co-operation scheme. The scheme is a three-year programme designed to provide participating countries with technical assistance in the form of training facilities and the services of experts.
