Geographical Features

The three main zones are:

(a) the Kyrenia range which rises to a height of over 3,000 feet, running along the northern coast and terminating in the Karpas peninsula;

(b) the massif in the south-west of the island, of which the highest point is Mount Olympus (6,406 feet); and

(c) the central plain, known as the "Mesaoria".

Climate

The mean temperature as recorded in Nicosia for the last 20 years is 66·6° F.; mean maximum 78·5° F.; mean minimum 54·7° F.; highest shade temperature during that time, 111° F.; lowest, 22° F.; average rainfall for the last 20 years, 21·58 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole island. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the coast; on the hills inland it is bracing and healthy. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. In winter the temperature...
rarely falls below freezing point on the plains and is mild on the coast, whilst the inland mountains are snow-covered for several weeks.

History

The history of Cyprus is long and eventful. In early historical times the island had been under the rule of Egypt, Persia, Rome and Byzantium. During the last named period its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. In 1191 Cyprus was conquered by Richard I of England following the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. From Richard the island passed to the Knights Templars, and later, when they found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, although the Genoese Republic held Famagusta from 1373 until 1464. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island and retained possession of it until its transfer to British administration.

On 4th June, 1878, a convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements" consented "to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England".

On 14th August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of 5th November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognized the annexation.

On 1st May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally made a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Constitution

Up to 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent of 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by Executive and Legislative Councils. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official members and 13 elected members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and 12 by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island, those clauses of the Letters Patent which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor. There is an Executive Council consisting, at present, of the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the Administrative Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, the Commissioner of Labour, and three non-official members.

On the 26th November, 1955, a state of emergency was declared in Cyprus. Under the Emergency Regulations the Governor has special powers for the maintenance of law and order in face of the campaign of armed attacks on security personnel and civilians and on public buildings which began in April, 1955. The Governor had previously assumed direct control of all internal security operations in the island, which he exercises through a Chief of Staff.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized and non-natives may acquire land. Except with the consent of the Governor, no alien may acquire, otherwise than by inheritance, ownership of any immovable property in the Colony. Compulsory acquisition of land may be made for purposes of public utility, with the consent of the Governor.

Taxation

Incomes which do not exceed £300 are exempted from income tax; and the tax ranges from 50 mils for every £ in excess of £300 to 750 mils for every £ in excess of £6,000. Relief is given at the rate of £50 for each unmarried child under the age of 16 or (if over 16) receiving full-time instruction at an educational establishment. Where any child between the ages of 11 and 25 is receiving full-time instruction outside the Colony, this allowance is increased to an amount not exceeding £250 in respect of expenditure incurred on the child's maintenance and education. Relief is also given in respect of the wife's earned income up to a maximum of £50, and in respect of life insurance premiums and pension and provident fund contributions. In the case of bachelors and spinsters the tax payable is increased by 33%, rising to 50% where the tax payable exceeds £90, up to a maximum of £500. The tax on salaries, wages and pensions is collected under the system of Pay As You Earn. Companies and similar bodies pay a flat rate of 425 mils in the £ and deduct this tax from any dividends declared; credit is given to the shareholder for the tax thus deducted in calculating his personal tax liability. Arrangements for relief from double taxation exist with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and Sweden, and relief is also given if tax is payable on the same income in any of Her Majesty's possessions where reciprocal relief is given. By an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom and the Greek Government there is reciprocal exemption of air transport profits between Cyprus and Greece.

Estate duty is levied on the estate of any deceased person which exceeds £2,000 in value. The rates of estate duty are not fixed on a percentage basis in the case of estates of £15,000 in value and under. Such estates are divided into categories and the rates are specific amounts chargeable on each category. The specific amounts so chargeable range from £40 on estates between £2,000 and £2,500 in value to £1,615 on estates between £14,000 and £15,000 in value. In the case of estates in excess of £15,000 in value a percentage is imposed. This percentage ranges between 21% and 30% on that part of the estate which exceeds £15,000 in value. Relief is given in respect of quick succession where the estate consists of immovable property or a business, and for estate duty paid in respect of the same estate in any country of the British Commonwealth.

- Bronze, 5 mils and 3 mils.

**Development Plans**

The Ten-year Development Plan, 1946–56, which was estimated to cost £7,640,977 is now almost completed. In November, 1955, it was announced that a new and comprehensive development programme costing in the region of £38,000,000 had been approved. The programme, details of which have not yet been published, will provide *inter alia* for expenditure on rural development, forestry, irrigation and agricultural research, public utilities, education—especially technical education—and housing. It was announced at the same time that the Cyprus Government would have the support of Her Majesty’s Government in securing the loan funds which they would need in due course to supplement their own resources in carrying out this programme.

**Other Development**

The Electricity Authority of Cyprus has continued to develop supplies of electricity in each of the main towns. The number of consumers connected to the supply at the 31st December, 1954, totalled 37,656, an increase of 4,214 over the preceding year. The number of units sold was 38,389,045, being an increase of 88.5% over sales during 1953. The average price per unit sold showed a reduction of 0.918 compared with 1953.

To meet the rapidly increasing demands the Authority are proceeding with the installation of 2–90,000 lb/hr. boilers and a 14,000 kW. turbo-alternator set. In addition construction work to provide supplies to an additional 90 villages is in hand.

**Education**

There is at present no form of higher education in Cyprus other than the two Teachers’ Training Colleges, one for men at Morphou and one for women at Nicosia. Secondary schools number 57 with an enrolment of 18,333, while elementary schools number 714 (Government) with an enrolment of 70,348 and 16 non-Government with an enrolment of 1,509. There are separate schools for Greeks, Turks, and Armenians, but most schools are co-educational. The school population is steadily increasing at present with a consequent rise in the number of teachers required and a need for more accommodation. Efforts are being made to develop technical education to a level more in keeping with the needs of the island.

Government expenditure on educational services in 1954–55 amounted to £1,014,403, compared with £121,986 in 1935.

**Libraries and Museums**

In Nicosia, Kyrenia, Limassol and Paphos there are public libraries which are controlled by the Municipalities. The Antiquities Department maintain a Museum at Nicosia.

**Health**

The Government hospitals (including two sanatoria, a mental hospital and a leper farm) provided 1,140 beds in 1954. In addition there were 663 beds in 46 private hospitals and 115 beds in 13 rural hospitals. Out-patients (first-attendances) at the six District Hospitals numbered 156,467; rural dispensaries dealt with 54,648.
Expenditure by Government on medical and allied services was £553,687 in 1954 compared with £52,436 in 1935.

Communications

Cyprus Airways Limited provide air services to Greece, Turkey, Beirut, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Benghazi, Tripoli, Cairo, Haifa, Port Sudan, Khartoum, Tel Aviv (Lod), Damascus, and in conjunction with B.E.A. to Rome-London. Other airlines serving the Colony are B.O.A.C., Greek National Airlines, El Al, Middle East Airlines, Air Liban, Turkish State Airlines and Skyways Limited (Colonial coach class service) and Syrian Airways. There is one international airport at Nicosia and an emergency landing ground at Tymbou. There are no internal services.

The following table shows the roads, excluding Forest Department roads, which exist in the Colony:

| Miles |
|-------|
| Commissioners' roads (mostly gravel) | 1,780 |
| P.W.D. roads (gravel) | 172 |
| P.W.D. roads (asphalt) | 792 |

2,744

The most important ports are Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol. Famagusta has a harbour where vessels of an overall length of 425 feet can easily be berthed alongside the quay. Vessels at Larnaca and Limassol anchor in the open roadstead about 4-5 cables off the main jetty, and goods are transported to and from the shore by means of lighters.

Regular passenger services are run between Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean. Cargo ships of many nationalities—the most regular being vessels of the British Conference Lines (Mediterranean Section), some of which accept passengers—call at Cyprus ports, on itineraries between Continental and Mediterranean ports, Mediterranean and Red Sea ports and U.S.A., Mediterranean and Black Sea ports.

There is no railway or inland waterway.

Broadcasting

The Cyprus Broadcasting Service which has been operating since October, 1953, is situated near Nicosia. It operates on two medium-wave frequencies of 692 Kc/s. with a power of 20 kW. and 606 Kc/s. with a power of 2 kW. An additional 20 kW. transmitter is expected to be operating in 1956 on the frequency of 606 Kc/s. Three languages are used—English, Greek and Turkish. The number of wireless licence holders in the Colony is approximately 70,000.

Principal Occupations

The principal occupation is agriculture in which some 142,000 persons are employed. Approximate numbers in other occupations are:

In towns, 45,000, including—

- Manufacture of textiles and wearing apparel | 4,000
- Manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco | 3,000
- Other manufactures | 7,000
- Construction | 8,000
- Commerce | 7,000
- Transport, storage and communications | 3,000
- In Government service | 6,000
- In mining | 5,000

At the end of 1954 there were three Employers' Associations with 88 members, and 125 Workmen's Unions with a membership of 23,512. In addition there were three Federations co-ordinating the activities of Workmen's Unions, with a membership of 21,707 and five Unions of Civil Servants, with a membership of 3,154.

Main Crops and Products

Wheat, barley, potatoes (two crops a year), citrus, deciduous fruits, pomegranates, vine products, legumes, onions, vegetables, figs, olives, almonds, carobs (locust beans), linseed and hemp fibre, sesame, cumin, aniseed, tobacco, cheese, wool, hides and skins.

The livestock population in 1954 was:

- Camels | 308
- Horses, mules and donkeys | 59,091
- Cattle | 34,718
- Sheep | 361,337
- Goats | 182,041
- Pigs | 35,025
- Poultry | 707,110
- Rabbits | 66,080

Timber production in 1954 was 1,009,000 cubic feet R.U.B. including 927,000 cubic feet of softwood (pine) and 82,000 of hardwood timber. Firewood and charcoal production amounted to 844,000 and 33,000 cubic feet respectively. All these products were consumed in Cyprus. In addition 3,056,000 cubic feet of timber and 578,000 of derivative products were imported in 1954.

Cyprus fisheries are not rich owing to the lack of nutrient salts, and the supply of fish is not equal to the demand. All the catch (397,040 okes* in 1954) is sold locally and consumed fresh. Production of inshore fisheries is negligible.

The principal minerals are cupreous and iron pyrites and asbestos. Some 700,000 tons of pyrites, 100,000 tons of copper concentrates and 15,000 tons of asbestos are exported yearly. Chromite, gypsum and terra umbra are also produced and exported.

Cotton yarn spun locally satisfies a big proportion of the Colony's requirements; cotton goods and a variety of towels are manufactured locally by two main weaving plants and satisfy part of the local demand. There has recently been established in the island a modern ginnery and de-linting plant.

Rayon goods, hosiery, knitwear and other wearing apparel are also manufactured on a limited scale. Other industries include the manufacture of cigarettes from imported and locally-grown yellow-leaf tobacco, wines and spirits, beer, cheese, macaroni, soap, soap oils, footwear, brooms, buckets, leather and leather goods, silk buttons, artificial teeth, carob gum, compound fodders, essential oils, refined edible oils, perfumery, nails, lithographed crown corks, jute goods, plasters and plasterboards, asbestos cement sheets, toilet paper, furniture, pottery, bricks, tiles and mosaic. Plants for the refining of olive oil, the canning of jams, marmalades, fruit juices and vegetables also operate. An up-to-date factory for tyre retreading has been operating in the island since 1950. A great expansion has also been observed in the production of aerated drinks and of sugared almonds, Turkish delight and other confectionery.

* 5 okes = 1 stone.
Two important village industries are the manufacturing of "aladja"—a special kind of cotton cloth mainly worn by the rural population—and of high quality laces. Other village industries are twine, rope, basket and mat-making.

### Tourist Traffic

During 1954 32,755 visitors came to Cyprus compared with 26,922 in 1953. Members of H.M. Forces and their families stationed in the Middle East were encouraged to spend their leave in Cyprus and more than 21,200 came. The island's economy benefited by this invisible export to the extent of about £1,800,000 (not included in the above figures).

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are at present no Marketing Boards in Cyprus, but the Government, acting through an appointed Board set up under special legislation as the Grain Commission, is the sole purchaser of wheat and barley using as its agents the co-operative societies in the villages.

Under other legislation a Vine Products Scheme has been established with the Commissioner for Co-operative Development as Controller. This Scheme purchases all grape alcohol (zivania) from the producers and resells to manufacturers of wines and spirits at a price which is fixed every six months. The Controller is advised by a Committee on which producers and manufacturers are represented. The same Scheme also purchases raisins from producers at a safety price fixed by Government and then resells.

The other form of organized marketing is that of the various co-operative marketing societies and unions which deal with substantial quantities of carobs, wines and spirits, fresh and dried fruits and potatoes. There are at present 780 co-operatives of which 479 are thrift and credit, 231 retail stores, 34 marketing and processing, 12 olive pressing, 7 transport, 6 farming, 4 machinery, 3 wholesale supply unions, 2 irrigation, 1 housing, and 1 Central Bank. Membership exceeds 130,000 and approximately 80% of the funds used by the movement comprise £850,000 of reserves and about £2,000,000 of deposits.
