UGANDA

Area

The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles (Northern Province 28,898, Buganda 25,631, Eastern Province 25,607, Northern Province 13,845) of which 13,689 square miles are water and swamp.

Population

The total population of the Protectorate as shown by the 1948 census—excluding Polish refugees and a very small number of persons in transit—was 4,958,520, made up as follows:

- Africans: 4,917,555
- Indians: 33,767
- Goans: 1,448
- Arabs: 1,475
- Europeans: 3,448
- Others: 827

The estimated total in 1954 was 5,425,000.

Principal Towns

The principal towns are Entebbe (seat of the Governor and the Central Government, population about 8,000), Kampala (commercial capital, population nearing 40,000), Jinja (population over 19,000), Mbale and Masaika. Administrative and trading centres also exist at Toro, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale and Mubende.

Geographical Features

The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,000 feet or less in the neighbourhood of Lake Albert and the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges, the Muhibiro or Birunga range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhavura (13,347 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley with its twin peaks Margherita (16,794 feet) and Alexandra (16,749 feet) is the highest point. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgo (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasiem (10,050 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, the Aswa and the Malawa. The total area of forest is approximately 2,684 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.

Climate

The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° and 75° and at Entebbe the mean temperature, the mean maximum and the mean minimum are 70°, 78°, and 63° respectively. The average annual rainfall varies between 40 and 55 inches, according to the area, over most of Uganda. The rainy season is not well-defined but there is generally one dry season from December to February and one fairly dry season from June to July.

History

In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa's dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there was a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company's influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga's kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June, 1894.

Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga's kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1899 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and in 1900 concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. The same year a similar Agreement was made with the Chiefs in Toro, and in 1901 with Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1902 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika Territory. In 1905 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.

Constitution

The Uganda Order in Council, 1920, provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions.
Changes in structure of both Councils were approved by the Secretary of State in July, 1955. By these changes Executive Council consists of 13 members (10 nominated members, 7 of whom have the status of Ministers, and 3 ex officio members) and the Governor as President.

The Legislative Council consists of 60 members and the Governor as President. The members are made up of 3 ex officio members, 14 other Government ministers and officials, and 13 nominated members on the Government Backbench; the remaining 30 are representative members.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern, and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the others owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 and the Buganda Agreement, 1955, by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka, acting as a constitutional ruler, with the advice of six Ministers. A hierarchy of chiefs are the executive officers of government. In other districts African local governments have been established, the principal officers being the Secretary-General, the Treasurer, and in some cases a Principal Judge. In the Agreement Districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro special conditions prevail.

County, sub-county, parish and village chiefs are the executive officers of local government and are advised and assisted by councils, which are now established in every province. These are at four levels—the parish, the sub-county, the county and the district—which provide a chain of election from the bottom upwards. In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces, the district council is the most important organ of government. In Buganda, however, where the assembly is at the provincial level, district councils do not exist and unofficial members are elected direct from the county councils to the "Great Lukiko" (i.e. the council of Buganda).

Land Policy

Alienation of Crown land to non-natives is now almost entirely suspended except for land required for mining purposes and within townships. Native-owned land may not be transferred to a non-native without the Governor's consent. There are a few non-native estates.

Taxation

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll tax, export taxes, stamp and estate duties, Customs and excise duties.

Income Tax is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from or received in East Africa by residents after any personal allowances have been deducted, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents. There is provision for double taxation relief between Uganda and the United Kingdom. Any person liable to pay African poll tax is exempt from paying income tax. A surtax is imposed on every £ of total income in excess of £2,000. On £2,004 the surtax is 1/- rising to Shs. 45,187/- on a total income of £9,500. Thereafter the next £10,500 is charged 10/- for every £ and the next £30,000 Shs. 10/50 for every £. Where total income exceeds £50,000 per annum the rate on the excess is 11/- in every £.

Poll Tax is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of 6/- per year throughout the Protectorate. An African Local Government Tax is levied by African local governments varying from 10/- to 120/- according to district and capacity to pay. Non-African Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £5 on incomes exceeding £200 per annum, and £3 on lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

Export Taxes are levied on lint cotton, coffee and hides and skins on a sliding scale by value, and on cotton seed by weight.

Companies Tax.—The rate of Income Tax applicable to companies is 4/- on every £ of chargeable income accrued in, derived from or received in the Protectorate. Non-resident companies are assessed on the same basis as resident companies.

Customs and Excise. The tariff is divided into ad valorem, specific and free goods. Ad valorem duties vary from 10% to 60%, the latter assessment only applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations. The basic rate of import duty is 23% ad valorem. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:—Sugar, cigarettes, cigars, manufactured tobacco, beer and matches.

- Coins: 1/-, 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent.
- Notes: 5/-, 10/-, 20/-, 100/-, and 200/-.

Shs. 1,000/- and 10,000/- notes are used only for transactions between the Banks and the Currency Board and are not in general circulation.
Development Plans

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, Uganda has received allocations of approximately £3,000,000.

A five-year Capital Development Plan was drawn up in 1954 to cover the period 1955-60. This plan envisages a capital development expenditure of £30,000,000.

Other Development

The Government has established the Uganda Development Corporation Limited with an authorized capital of £8,000,000 (£5,000,000 issued) to develop the resources of the Protectorate and to encourage and assist private enterprise in the establishment of new industries. The Corporation has taken over the Government's interest in the Uganda Cement Industry Limited, the Uganda Fish Marketing Corporation Limited and in the Lake Victoria Hotel Limited, Entebbe, and its plans include engagement in the development of the mining, textile and agricultural industries. The mineral deposits at Sukulu, near Tororo, consisting principally of apatite, magnetite and pyrochlore, have been proved by a syndicate, of which the Uganda Development Corporation Limited is a partner and which it is hoped to develop. The Corporation is also a partner in Kilembe Mines Limited, which is opening up the copper and cobalt deposits at Kilembe. The construction of the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja by the Uganda Electricity Board, a Government-financed utility corporation, was completed in 1954 and will provide an output of 90,000 kW. of power capable of subsequent expansion to 150,000 kW.

Education

The majority of the African Schools in Uganda are managed by religious Voluntary Agencies; the administration of Asian Schools is shared between Government and the local communities; primary education for European children is provided in the big towns.

At the end of 1954 there were 1,700 grant-aided primary schools and 150 grant-aided secondary schools. In these primary schools there were approximately 231,000 children and in the secondary schools approximately 16,000. The number of un-aided schools exceeds 2,000 and their estimated school population is approximately 300,000. There were also at the beginning of 1955 38 Training Colleges with a total enrolment of 3,184 students.

The University College of East Africa at Makerere (Kampala) was established in 1939 as an independent self-governing institution catering for all the East African territories; since 1953 the College has been in special relationship with London University and students have been awarded degrees of that University. In addition 96 Uganda students were in receipt of scholarships or bursaries from various sources and were attending courses of higher education overseas.

The total recurrent expenditure on all types of education, including capital grants to schools managed by Voluntary Agencies, in the first six months of 1954 was £1,267,295. Expenditure on school buildings by the Public Works Department totalled £174,907. Government expenditure in 1935 was £76,093.

Libraries and Museums, etc.

There is a public library at Kampala; the Uganda Museum is also situated there.

Health

The commonest causes of illness are malaria, respiratory infections, trachoma, tropical ulcers and venereal disease, and particular attention is being paid to the prevention and treatment of these conditions. Special wards for the treatment of tuberculosis are being built at three district hospitals and a Medical Officer with special training will be responsible for co-ordinating investigations and control of tuberculosis throughout the Protectorate. Very considerable progress has been made in the treatment of leprosy and the system of village settlements is expanding rapidly.

The principal hospitals for all races are at Kampala, the African Hospital being closely associated with Makerere College Medical School. The Medical Department and African Local Authorities maintain 30 hospitals and six rural hospitals as well as two hospitals in prisons and a mental hospital. There is also a network of 153 dispensaries run by the Medical Department and the African Local Government. One hundred and nineteen of these dispensaries have beds. The dispensaries are in charge of Medical Auxiliaries, but are visited by Medical Officers at frequent intervals. There are also 99 aid posts which are run in conjunction with certain dispensaries and are visited at weekly intervals by the Medical Auxiliaries. Missionary Societies provide nine hospitals and 41 smaller units. Hospitals and dispensaries of employers of labour provide 510 beds. The total number of beds throughout the Protectorate is 6,789 of which 1,418 are reserved for maternity cases. There are 1·3 hospital beds per 1,000 of the population.

In 1954, 78,332 patients were admitted to Government hospitals, and 669,655 were treated as out-patients. A total of 2,446,342 patients were treated in Government hospitals and dispensaries during 1954; an average just less than one person in two throughout the Protectorate attended a Government medical unit for treatment at least once during the year.

Expenditure on the Medical Department was £467,488 for the first six months of 1954 compared with £148,907 in the year 1935.

Communications

At Entebbe there is a first-class international airport which can accept the largest aircraft now flying commercially and is extensively used by B.O.A.C. as a principal stopping place on their route to South Africa, and by Air France, Sabena, etc. The East African Airways Corporation also regularly uses the Entebbe Airport for its scheduled services. In addition Entebbe is a staging point on many charter flights. Over 62,000 passengers used the airport in 1954. There are also landing grounds at Kasexe, Jinja, Tororo, Mbarara, Masindi, Gulu, Soroti, Arua, Lira, Moroto, Lolelia and Lomej, and privately licensed airfields at Kasenyi, Kamwenge, Kijjura and near the Murchison Falls National Park.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission") which also maintains a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga between Namasagali and Masindi Port; and on Lake Victoria between Port Bell, Entebbe, Kisumu and Tanganyika ports. A service is maintained on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule (connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan) and between Butiaba and the Belgian Congo port of Kasenyi. A road
transport service operates between Masindi Port and Butiaba. A through service is thus provided by the Railway Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Belgian Congo.

There are 2,828 miles of all-weather main roads, for the most part radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres, and about 8,000 miles of roads maintained by the African local governments.

Broadcasting

The Uganda Broadcasting Service commenced regular transmission on 1st March, 1954, and is now on the air daily-in Luganda and English. It operates on 5,026 kc/s per second in the 60 metre short wave band, and on 308·9 metres in the medium wave band. Permanent studios were opened in Kampala in 1955 and plans are in hand for extending the service to include other African languages.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle-raising on their own account. Approximate numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in the principal industries and occupations are: agriculture 50,000; Government service (administrative) 8,500; African local government 36,000; ginning 22,000; forestry and fishing 2,000; transport and communications 7,000; wholesale and retail trade 5,000; manufactures, including electricity 23,000; mining and quarrying 7,000; construction 46,000; education and medical services 15,500; other services 8,000: total 230,000.

The foregoing figures are based on a census covering all known employers of five or more persons excluding domestic servants. The figures are, therefore, not complete as the many thousands of Africans working in ones and twos for African employers are not included.

Little interest has yet been shown in trade unionism, and there are only four registered trade unions. The formation of joint staff committees and works councils is actively encouraged and this simple form of industrial relations machinery has now been introduced in 50 of the larger employing establishments in different parts of the country covering some 33,000 employees.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), maize, sugar, tea, tobacco, millets, plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava and groundnuts.

The number of cattle sold in established markets in 1954 was 101,000. Hides and skins are an important export.

Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hardwoods. Internal consumption is rising rapidly and most of the timber available for export is absorbed by the other East African territories, from which in return the bulk of the Protectorate's softwood imports are obtained. In 1954 some 30,000 tons of sawn timber were produced.

The chief minerals are ores of tungsten and tin of which 168 and 119 tons respectively were produced in 1954. In addition small quantities of amblygonite, columbite-tantalite, beryl, galena, microlite and bismuth ore are produced. Gold production in 1954 was 568 ounces.

The fishing industry is of growing importance to Uganda. At present production is approximately 24,600 tons per year with a value of £981,000 and of this total some 17,000 tons is consumed within the country, the remainder being exported to other East African Territories and the Belgian Congo.

The cement factory of Uganda Cement Industries has recently come into production at Tororo, and preliminary steps for the erection of a textile factory at Jinja have been completed. In the 1954-55 season 138 cotton ginneries were operating. The coffee crop was handled by eight coffee curing works. Seven hullerries, capable of bringing coffee to fair average quality standards, processed fixed quotas of the crop. A number of estate coffee factories processed the coffee grown on the larger estates. Amongst other undertakings processing agricultural produce were two sugar factories, 14 tea factories, one tobacco manufacturing works and large numbers of maize mills and oil-expressing mills.

Trade

Excluding all inter-territorial trade with Kenya and Tanganyika.

(These figures include bullion and specie)

In 1954 45% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 17% from other Commonwealth countries, 26% from foreign countries and 12% unallotted.

In 1954 27% of domestic exports went to the United Kingdom, 38·3% to other Commonwealth countries, and 34·7% to foreign countries. In 1938 the corresponding figures were 18%, 67% and 15%.

Principal Exports by Volume and Value

| Item          | 1938 | 1953 | 1954 |
|---------------|------|------|------|

| Oilseeds      | 63   | 819  | 752  |
| Tea           | 1    | 25   | 44   |

The principal imports are machinery, vehicles and bicycles; cotton piece-goods and other textiles; base metal manufactures; rubber tyres and tubes; fuels and lubricants.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Provision has been made by legislation for the organized marketing of cotton and coffee, the two main cash crops of the Protectorate. Legislation which was enacted in the middle of 1953 provides, among other things, for increased
African participation in the producing side of the coffee industry. Producer prices are announced before the marketing season opens and it is also the practice to announce a minimum guaranteed price for cotton at planting time. The Cotton Price Assistance Fund stands at slightly more than £20,000,000. A sum of £18,200,000 has already been voted into the African Development Fund which provides the finance for a number of schemes for the benefit of the African community. The Coffee Price Assistance Fund, as at 30th June, 1954, stood at about £15,000,000, but since that date over £4,000,000 have been used to support the price paid to growers for coffee in the 1954-55 season, following the fall in world prices, by resolution of Legislative Council. By February, 1955, £7,000,000 was paid from the Fund to the Coffee Industry Fund where it will still remain available for price assistance purposes.

The number of co-operative societies had grown from four in 1947 to 1,025 at the end of 1954. Of these, 748 were members of 11 co-operative unions. Co-operative societies had a membership at the end of 1954 of over 94,000 and marketed produce valued at more than £2,600,000 during that year.

Nine cotton ginneries are now being run by African Co-operative Unions. Under the Acquisition of Ginneries Ordinance, 1952, Government has powers over a five-year period to acquire up to 20 ginneries for operation by African co-operative enterprise.
