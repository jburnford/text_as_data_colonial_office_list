FEDERATION OF MALAYA

Area

The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,690 square miles. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang and the smallest is the State of Perlis.

Population

The total estimated population at 31st December, 1954, was 5,982,588.

| Group         | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| Malaysians    | 2,936,619  |
| Chinese       | 2,251,950  |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 704,590 |
| Europeans     | 15,925     |
| Eurasians     | 12,338     |
| Others        | 61,166     |
| Total         | 5,982,588  |

The Chinese predominate in the south-western States and in Penang, the commercial and industrial area, whereas there is a bigger percentage of Malaysians in the north and east and in Malacca.

Citizenship legislation which came into force on 15th September, 1952, confers citizenship by operation of law on all subjects of the rulers of the States and certain categories of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in the...
Federation. It is estimated that the number of persons who were citizens by operation of law at 31st December, 1954, was 4,337,696:

- Malaysians: 2,857,164
- Chinese: 1,210,227
- Indians and Pakistanis: 235,038
- Others: 35,267

As a general rule for non-Malays who are not Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies the qualification necessary for automatic citizenship and State nationality is to have been born in the Federation and to have had one parent born there also. Non-Malays without this qualification may, under certain conditions, acquire citizenship by registration or naturalization. The policy behind the legislation is to make citizenship available (i) by operation of law to anyone who by birth can be assumed to be sufficiently assimilated to the life and loyalty of the country; and (ii) by registration or naturalization to others who have reasonable qualifications to be regarded as Malayans.

**Geographical Features**

The Federation occupies the southern section of the Kra Peninsula, which protrudes at the south-eastern corner of Asia between India and China. It is divided by mountain ranges, the main trend of which is north and south. The highest mountain is Gunong Tahan, 7,186 feet. This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory on the Asian mainland south of the Himalayas. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country, while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains, which are mainly alluvial, and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80% of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp. The coastline of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west lies a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat, with infrequent indentations of bays. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand. The Settlement of Penang is on the Island of Penang about one mile off the west coast of the Peninsula and 70 miles south of the Federation's boundary with Siam. Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands (rising to over 2,000 feet) off the north Kedah coast, and off the east coast, Tioman and other scattered islands.

The two principal rivers are the Perak and the Pahang, both over 250 miles long.

That part of the country cleared of forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas, as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other areas, particularly the Kinta Valley, Perak, have been mined for tin.

**Climate**

The principal features of the climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons, which correspond roughly with the summer and winter of northern latitudes; but, apart from the east coast, the differences of climate normally associated with the word "monsoon" are barely discernible in Malaya. On the east coast, and for a few miles inland, the wettest period is from November to January. In most other places, maximum rainfall occurs in October and November with a less pronounced maximum in March and April. Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year though the annual fall varies considerably from place to place and year to year. Jelebu in Negri Sembilan is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches, and Maxwell's Hill in Perak the wettest, with 199 inches a year.

The average maximum temperature in the plains is rather less than 90° F. and the minimum about 70° F. At the hill stations temperatures are considerably lower; at Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 80° F. and 36° F. and at Fraser's Hill 82° F. and 53° F. The nights are reasonably cool everywhere and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity, somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not possible at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate is desirable for Europeans if health is to be maintained.

**History**

In 1786 Francis Light obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795 during the Napoleonic wars, but was handed back to the Dutch in 1814. The loss of Malacca caused Stamford Raffles to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Temasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. Raffles obtained a concession from the representative of the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. As a free port Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands in 1824 when, by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London, Malaya was recognized as a British sphere of influence. The Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca and Singapore which at first came under the India Office, passed to the control of the Colonial Office in 1867. The extension of British authority into the Peninsula was hastened by unsettled conditions in the Malay States which had deteriorated in some cases into civil war and disorder. In 1873 the new Governor of the Straits Settlements came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the Treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern States by the Treaty of Bangkok. In 1910 agreements were concluded with Kelantan and Trengganu (the latter amended in 1919) in 1923 with Kedah and in 1930 with Perlis. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were similar in their main features.
Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in turn guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each State a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the Rulers agreed to follow in all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The foundations of good government and friendly relations laid by such early Residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories in the Commonwealth.

In the early years of the century Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a Federation (the Federated Malay States) with a Resident-General as chief executive officer, and a system of centralized government was inaugurated. This system lasted in varying forms until 1932, when there was a measure of decentralization by which legislative powers were to some extent restored to the States and the authority of the Rulers and Residents was reinforced.

Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt stop during the Japanese occupation from December 1941 to August 1945. On the liberation of the country, the Government of the Malayan Union was established, but this administrative system met with strong objections by the Malays and on the 1st February, 1948, a new Constitution came into force. The new Constitution allowed each State and Settlement to retain its individuality under a strong central government. In 1955, the first national elections for filling the majority of seats in the central Legislature were held. Immediately following the elections the first Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, was appointed and full Ministerial officers were appointed to the various portfolios held by Members of the Federal Executive Council.

**Constitution**

The Federation of Malaya, which comprises the nine Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu and the two British Settlements of Penang and Malacca, was constituted on 1st February, 1948, by:

(a) the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, between His Majesty King George VI and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu;

(b) the State Agreements between His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers; and

(c) the Federation of Malaya Order in Council, 1948.

The Federation of Malaya Agreement, as from time to time amended, provides for an Executive Council, presided over by the High Commissioner, consisting of not less than 12 or more than 26 members, of whom 2 are ex officio, being the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General, and the rest are Ministers appointed by the High Commissioner; and for a Legislative Council presided over by a Speaker. Of its 98 members, 52 are elected Members, 25 are Appointed Members representing commerce (6), rubber (6), tin (4), trade unions (4), agriculture and husbandry (2) and racial minorities (3); 9 are the Mentri Menteri Besar (Chief Ministers) of the Malay States; 2 represent the Settlements of Penang and Malacca; 2 are the ex officio Members mentioned above; and 8 are nominated by the High Commissioner to represent minorities who would otherwise be inadequately represented in the Legislative Council. The majority of the Members appointed to represent specific interests are by the Agreement required to be chosen by independent organizations and associations.

Of the 52 elected Members of the Legislative Council 51 represent the Alliance Party formed by the combination of the United Malays National Organization, the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress; one represents the Pan Malayan Islamic Party. The first Federal elections for filling these seats were held on 27th July, 1955, and were based on the principle of universal adult franchise for all Federal citizens on a common electoral roll.

The Chief Minister is one of the Appointed Members of the Executive Council and the High Commissioner is required to consult him before appointing the remaining Appointed Members.

The Federation Agreement also established a Conference of Rulers consisting of the Rulers of all the Malay States. The Conference meets the High Commissioner at least three times a year.

The State Agreements provide for the establishment of a State Executive Council and a Council of State in each State. The Council of State is the legislative body. In each of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca there is a Nominated Council and a Settlement Council. The Settlement Council, as the local legislative body, corresponds to the Council of State in a Malay State.

**Emergency**

Since June 1948 a state of Emergency has existed in Malaya. Special powers were assumed by the Government in that month to preserve law and order in the face of outbreaks of violence perpetrated by the Malayan Communist Party. Communist terrorists have since then carried out guerrilla operations from jungle bases in an attempt, by ambush, murder and the destruction of property, to impose their will on the Malayan people. They have not succeeded in doing this, but they have caused a great deal of suffering to innocent people. The Government, with the assistance of its locally raised (and largely voluntary) Security Forces, as well as British and Commonwealth troops, and with the support of the large majority of the people of Malaya, has made great efforts to put down terrorism. After the murder in October 1951 of Sir Henry Gurney, the then High Commissioner and a devoted servant of the people of Malaya, General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed High Commissioner and Director of Operations and Mr. D. C. (now Sir Donald) MacGillivray, Deputy High Commissioner. These appointments were the first steps in a widespread reorganization of the Security Forces and other Government machinery.

By the time of General Templer’s departure in May 1954, terrorist activity had steeply declined and the increasing flow of information about the terrorists given to the Security Forces reflected the renewal of public confidence. This progress has continued under the regime of Sir Donald MacGillivray, who succeeded General Templer as High Commissioner, and of Lieutenant-General Sir Geoffrey Bourne, G.O.C. Malaya Command, who succeeded General Templer as Director of Operations. The problem of the Security Forces
has now largely resolved itself into eliminating the remaining 3,000 communist terrorists in their deep jungle bases. On September 8th, 1955, an amnesty declaration was made by the Government which promised freedom from prosecution to any terrorists, or anyone who had consorted with the terrorists, if they came in and surrendered.

Large areas in the Federation have now been cleared of terrorists and have been declared "White Areas", i.e., areas free of Emergency restrictions. These White Areas now take in nearly half the population of the Federation.

In an address to the Legislative Council on the 30th November, 1955, the High Commissioner referred to the striking improvement in the Emergency situation and declared that Her Majesty's Government "would see no reason to regard the continuance of the Emergency as an obstacle in the Federation's advance towards self-government".

Land Policy

The Torrens system of registration of title to land is in force in the Federation, except in the Settlements of Penang and Malacca where it is intended to introduce registration of title as soon as is practicable. Most alienated land is held in perpetuity on payment of an annual rent to Government. It is now the usual practice, however, to alienate town land on 99-year leases. Malay Reservations have been created within which land may not be alienated to non-Malays. State land, not lying within Malay Reservations, and Crown land may be alienated to Federal citizens and non-Federal citizens.

Taxation

The main form of taxation is income tax. All persons not resident in the Federation are chargeable at a flat rate of 30%. There is provision for relief for a non-resident British subject or a non-resident British protected person. In the case of individuals resident in the Federation, $3,000 is deductible from assessable income if the individual is unmarried. A further allowance of $2,000 is made to a married man. Allowances are also made in respect of children up to nine in number, for life assurance premiums paid, and for obligatory or contractual contributions to approved pension or provident funds. The rate of tax on the chargeable income remaining after the above-mentioned allowances have been made varies from 3% on the first $500 to 30% on chargeable income in excess of $50,000. The rate of tax chargeable on the income of companies was raised to 30% in 1951. A double taxation relief arrangement with the United Kingdom is in operation. The more important forms of indirect taxation are the import duty on tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, petrol, malt liquors, spirits and textiles; and the export duty on tin, tin-in-ore and rubber.

The nine State and two Settlement Governments have their own budgets, covering certain agreed items of revenue and expenditure; the Federal Government makes allocations to enable these budgets to be balanced. The figures given above represent the totals of Federal, State and Settlement revenue and expenditure in each year. The figures of revenue for 1950, 1952, 1953 and 1954 include contributions from Her Majesty's Government in aid of defence expenditure of $25,714,286 (£3,000,000), $3,385,714 (£395,000), $1,200,000 (£140,000) and $2,046,033 (£238,703) respectively. The figure for 1954 also includes an interest free loan of $52,500,000 made jointly to the Governments of the Federation and Singapore by Her Majesty's Government for the War Damage Fund balanced by an equal sum entered under "Expenditure". The 1954 figures do not include a contribution from Her Majesty's Government of $51,428,571 towards the cost of the Emergency, nor the loan of $30,000,000 from the Government of the Colony of Singapore.

Approximately 57% of the Federal Revenue in 1954, exclusive of all contributions from Her Majesty's Government, was derived from Customs revenue and 24% from Income Tax. The main heads of Federal Expenditure as a charge on Revenue and General Revenue Balances in 1954 were as follows:

Malayan $ million

- Allocation to State and Settlement Governments: 155.75
- The Treasury: 158.36
- Emergency: 146.57
- Defence and Internal Security: 88.63
- Works: 47.35
- Posts and Telecommunications: 28.19
- Home Affairs: 17.41
- Natural Resources: 15.03
- Health: 14.89
- Chief Secretary: 12.18
- Education: 10.99

but Health and Education are mainly the responsibility of State and Settlement Governments which spent a total of $34,900,000 on Health and $70,400,000 on Education in 1954.

The Public Debt of the Federation of Malaya on the 31st December, 1954, amounted to $465,350,000 (approximately $78 per head of population) as follows:

- External 3% F.M.S. Sterling Loan, 1960–70: $34,285,714

- 4½% F.M. Security Loan, 1963–73: $40,000,000
- 4½% F.M. Local Loan, 1964–74: $60,000,000

The value of the Sinking Funds at 31st December, 1954, was $95,090,350 and the Federation of Malaya's share of the Straits Settlements Public Debt was $11,900,000.
Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is exclusive legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency notes of denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, and $1 issued by:

(a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners.

(b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.

(c) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel and cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iii) Copper coin and bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

Silver coins ceased to be legal tender from 31st December 1952.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The nominal circulation on 31st December 1954, was:

Notes $779 million, coins $26·6 million.

Development Plans

A six-year Draft Development Plan was prepared in 1950 and has been the basis for subsequent development expenditure. During 1954 a Mission from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development visited Malaya, and among its recommendations has suggested a detailed programme of development for the next five years. Existing development expenditure is to be revised in the light of the Bank Mission's report. The latest figures of capital expenditure for the period 1950–54 are as follows:

| Service Type       | $ million | Per cent |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|
| Social Services    | 255·5     | 37·7     |
| Basic Services     | 354·3     | 52·2     |
| Productive Services| 68·5      | 10·1     |
| Total              | 678·3     | 100·0    |

Social Services.—22·1% of the total expenditure has been spent on the resettlement of squatters in New Villages, 3·8% on education facilities, 1·8% on health, and 10·3% on housing.

Basic Services.—13·1% of the total expenditure has been on electricity, 13·9% on railways, 17·2% on roads, 7·6% on telecommunications and 4·6% on water supplies.

Productive Services.—4·6% of the total has been spent on drainage and irrigation works, and 5·4% on agriculture generally.

The sources of funds have been:

(a) The Federation's territorial allocation of $24 million under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act together with a further sum of $10·5 million from centrally held allocations;

(b) The Colonial Development Corporation which has so far provided $50·8 million towards the development of electric power;

(c) Federation of Malaya Government loans totalling $465·3 million; and

(d) Revenue.

Education

The University of Malaya, serving the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, has faculties of Arts, Science and Medicine. In the 1954-55 session there were 604 students from the Federation. The Technical College, Kuala Lumpur, has accommodation for 500 students, and the Agricultural College, Serdang, has 80 students. Government awards scholarships and bursaries for higher education, tenable at the University of Malaya or in the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand. There are 300 students being trained as teachers for English schools at the Malayan Teachers' Training College, Kirkby, Lancashire, 150 at its sister College in Kota Bharu, Kelantan, and in addition there are over 1,100 Malayan students at Universities and centres of higher learning overseas. In 1954 there were 158,485 (47,284 secondary) pupils in 355 English schools (schools for mixed races where the medium of instruction is English), 349,583 pupils in 2,086 Malay Schools, 251,124 pupils in 1,236 Chinese schools and 44,561 pupils in 894 Indian schools.

With Government aid, Adult Education Associations have been formed in all States and Settlements and about 20,000 adult students enrolled. Government grants to the Association totalled $300,000.

Expenditure on Educational Services in 1954 was about $81,390,000.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

There are museums in Kuala Lumpur and in Taiping, both of which have libraries, and new museums have been established in Malacca, Seremban and Penang. Under the Preservation of Books Ordinance, 1950, three copies of all publications printed in the Federation are required to be sent to the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur. The Malayan Historical Society, founded in 1953, is producing district and town histories and recording much information which would otherwise be lost. Archaeological research is conducted from the National Museum, and Anthropological research by the Department of Aborigines.

Health

In 1954 Government maintained 71 hospitals with 12,763 beds; general 8,113, maternity 1,305 and infectious—including pulmonary tuberculosis—3,345. In addition, Government maintains four institutions with 3,480 beds for the treatment of leprosy and two mental hospitals of 4,200 beds. At Government hospitals the total number of in-patients treated was 238,696 (general 235,738, mental 2,249, and leprosy 709). On rubber estates there are 120 hospitals maintained privately with 5,313 beds; 99,770 in-patients were admitted during 1954. Treatment of the rural population is carried out through dispensaries (including static, mobile road and river boat units) and infant welfare centres. These number 172, 75, 15 and 501 respectively, and the total number of new cases treated was 4,559,090.

The principal diseases treated in Government hospitals throughout the Federation were as follows:—Malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, dysentery, diarrhoea and enteritis, pneumonia, bronchitis, beri-beri, venereal diseases and enteric fever.

As a result of a yaws survey conducted under the auspices of the WHO in Kelantan and Trengganu, an anti-yaws campaign was inaugurated in 1954.
Satisfactory progress is being made and considerable areas of these States have been covered. It is hoped to eliminate yaws completely from these areas.

The main anti-malarial measures in towns and villages are sub-soil drainage by permanent works, oiling and D.D.T. spraying of houses. Water supplies are treated according to modern methods, sanitation is either water-borne or by bucket system of removal in all the towns.

The total expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1954 was $47,185,123 compared with $16,623,487 in 1947.

Communications

About 1,300 route miles are covered by domestic air services. The Dakota fleet of Malayan Airways Limited serves the eight main aerodromes (Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Penang, Alor Star, Kota Bharu, Kuantan and Malacca). In addition, the Federation Air Service provides air communications with the more remote places. This service is owned by Government and operated by the Malayan Railway, and it has a fleet of five DH Beaver aeroplanes. There are 44 landing grounds available to Beavers on scheduled or chartered services.

Malayan Airways, Ltd., amongst other services operated, run 36 services a week between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore; they also operate to Medan and Bangkok. The Union of Burma Airways and Thai Airways Ltd. operate between Penang and Rangoon and Penang and Bangkok respectively.

The route mileage of the Malayan Railway open to traffic in 1954 was 1,028. The main line runs from Singapore 488 miles north-westwards to Prai (opposite Penang Island); there are short branches to the west coast, and a longer branch (99 miles) from Bukit Mertajam northwards to the Thailand frontier at Padang Besar; the east coast line runs from Gemas (137 miles from Singapore) northwards 327 miles to Tumpat on the north-east coast of the peninsula.

The Malayan Railway connects with the Thailand Railway at Padang Besar and Sungei Golok.

Passenger journeys in 1954 totalled 6,812,358 and revenue-earning goods tonnage 2,122,907. Gross revenue reached the record figure of $61.06 million; operating expenditure was $51.7 million.

The Public Works Department maintains about 6,354 miles of public road, of which 4,403 miles is metalled surface, grouted or sealed with bitumen, 250 metalled surface waterbound, 687 hard surface waterbound, 674 earth surface, 318 hard surface bitumen sealed, and 22 concrete surface.

The principal ports in the Federation are Penang and Port Swettenham; the numbers and net registered tonnages of ships of 75 tons and over which entered and cleared thereat during 1954 were:

| Port          | Entered | Cleared |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Penang        | 2,334   | 2,341   |
| Port Swettenham | 1,307   | 1,307   |

Tonnages of cargo (in "freight" tons) discharged and loaded, including cargo from and to ships of 75 tons and under were:

- Penang: 1,884,081
- Port Swettenham: 1,146,498

Navigational aids around the 800-mile coast are maintained by the Marine Department.

Services to and from the United Kingdom are provided by the main shipping companies on the Far Eastern service. Local companies provide coastal services to ports in South-East Asia.

Broadcasting

The Department of Broadcasting is pan-Malayan. It maintains stations of "Radio Malaya" at Kuala Lumpur (two 10 kW. medium wave transmitters, and one 5 kW. shortwave), Penang (two 2 kW. medium wave), and Malacca (one 350 watt medium wave) but much of the Federation is served by the shortwave transmitters of "Radio Malaya", Singapore. A new unattended transmitter serving the Ipoh area is now in the course of installation and should be operating in January 1956. There were 128,344 licence holders in the Federation on 31st December 1954, including 13,158 subscribers to Rediffusion (Malaya) Limited. Over 1,600 schools in the Federation are equipped with receivers for the reception of school broadcasts from Radio Malaya. Special rural broadcasts in Malay, Tamil, Mandarin and six other Chinese dialects are broadcast from the Federation transmitters. They are also heard on about 1,000 community receivers installed in rural areas by the Government and on receivers installed on several hundred mines and estates for the benefit of the workers.

Work is proceeding on the new broadcasting centre at Kuala Lumpur, and the Studios are expected to be fully operative in 1956.

Principal Occupations

Apart from the 200,000–250,000 who are self-employed in peasant agriculture (including rubber smallholdings) or fishing, the larger part of the working population is engaged directly or indirectly in the rubber industry.

- Rubber plantations: 272,300
- Coconut, oil-palm and tea plantations: 26,000
- Tin mining: 35,800
- Gold mining: 900
- Coal mining: 1,000
- Tin smelting: 640
- Road Transport: 7,900
- Civil Government—labourers: 59,800
- Armed Forces—labourers: 4,100

These figures apply only to "labourers" as defined in the Labour Laws of the territory.

There are (as at 30th June, 1955) 244 registered trade unions of employers and employees, consisting of 141 Civil Servants' Unions, 96 Industrial Workers' Unions and seven Employers' Unions. Civil Servants' Unions have 45,685 members who are drawn from all races and from 18 different types of Government occupations. Industrial Workers' Unions have 75,650 members drawn from about 17 different categories of employment. The seven Employers' Unions have a membership of 838, of whom the Rubber and Tin Employers' Unions are the most important.
The total membership is 122,173. An approximate break-down by races is 65% Indians, 15% Chinese, 18% Malays and 2% others.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are rubber, rice, oil palm, coconuts, pineapples and tea. There are 3½ million acres of land under rubber, more than half the area under all agricultural crops. Rubber small-holdings cover 1½ million acres. Total production in 1954 was 582,991 tons.

The livestock population numbers: cattle, including buffaloes 525,000, goats 272,000, sheep 27,000, pigs 399,000, equines 650.

The bulk of the commercial timber of Malaya is produced by the Dipterocarpaceae, but much timber is produced which is not at present of commercial value. The outturn of logs in 1954 was 925,000 tons of 50 cubic feet round, all of which were sawn locally. There is a flourishing export trade in graded sawn timber mainly to the United Kingdom and Australia, which totalled 70,000 tons in 1954; 37,000 tons of ungraded timber were exported, mainly to Mauritius, Aden and the Persian Gulf.

The total production of fish per annum is now of the order of 158,500 tons, with a retail value of $165,000,000. Of this total, approximately 135,000 tons is produced in the Federation and 23,500 tons is landed in Singapore; 25,000 tons is from fresh water sources, mostly fishpond culture. $1,120,000 worth of the total fish production is used as manure and animal fodder. Approximately 12,200 tons of dried fish is produced in the Federation and exported through Singapore to many parts of Asia.

Mineral production during 1954 was as follows:

- Tin-in-concentrates: 60,690 tons
- Iron ore: 1,212,780 tons
- Coal: 224,540 tons
- Gold: 20,955 oz. (troy)
- Bauxite: 165,621 tons
- Ilmenite: 44,745 tons (exports)
- Columbite: 111 tons
- Wolfram: 54 tons
- Scheelite: 45 tons
- China clay: 1,352 tons

The Federation of Malaya was responsible for 34·3% of the world's total production of tin-in-concentrates and the value of her exports of tin metal during 1954 was $221 million; other mineral exports were valued at $30,998,675 (Malayan).

Manufactures include tyres and tubes, bricks (over 31 million in 1954), canvas/rubber and other footwear and soap (13,205 tons in 1954).

In 1947, 19·3% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 24·7% from other Commonwealth countries, 19·2% from Indonesia, and 36·8% from other foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1954 were, 19·4%, 16·9%, 29·9% and 33·8%.

In 1947, 16·1% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 19·7% to other Commonwealth countries, 33·9% to U.S.A., and 30·3% to other foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1954 were 14·6%, 22·4%, 14·9% and 48·1%.

About 37% of the Federation's import and export trade is channelled through Singapore. An increasing proportion, however, particularly of imports, is being channelled through Federation ports. Trade with the United Kingdom has decreased slightly. Commonwealth imports have also declined. Imports from neighbouring territories have also fallen from the peak of 1950–51 when rubber and tin were booming. Imports, however, from Canada and the U.S.A. have risen slightly.

The United States has continued to be one of the largest customers for Malayan exports. Exports to the United Kingdom are now at about the same level as those to the U.S.A. after having been lower immediately after the war. Exports to neighbouring territories have fluctuated with changing conditions, both economic and political, and appear to be declining.
