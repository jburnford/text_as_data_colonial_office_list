THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

Area

The total area of the Islands is 826 square miles.

Population

At the end of 1954 the total population was about 308,000. The majority are of the negro race; less than 5% are white. There are a few persons of East Indian descent, and a few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica.

Principal Towns

The capitals of the four colonies are:

- Grenada—St. George's (residence of Governor)
- Dominica—Roseau
- St. Lucia—Castries
- St. Vincent—Kingstown

Population

| Colony       | Population |
|--------------|------------|
| Grenada      | 5,772      |
| Dominica     | 12,000     |
| St. Lucia    | 8,576      |
| St. Vincent  | 5,791      |

Geographical Features

The islands are of volcanic origin and the more sheltered coasts are fringed by reefs. Torrential streams from the more rugged areas tend to lose their gradient nearer the coast and the deposition of their sediments has led to the formation of fertile river flats and occasional river terraces. The residual clays on the rugged volcanic areas are comparatively fertile. One of the volcanoes in the Windward region (St. Vincent) was active in 1902. At the Soufrieres of Dominica and St. Lucia and in parts of Grenada hot sulphuretted gases still emerge and there are numerous hot springs which contain salts.

Climate

The prevailing trade winds provide a delightful climate. There is little variation between night and day.

History

As early as 1763 one Governor was appointed for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government. On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad. On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

Constitution and Administration

Each of the four colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada, where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Windward Islands. The government of each colony is administered by a resident Administrator subject to instructions from the Governor. There is no common Legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. Each colony has a Legislative Council presided over by the Administrator, in which the majority of members are elected by universal adult suffrage; and each colony has an Executive Council which may be summoned and consulted by either the Governor or the Administrator. A Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the Chief Justices of the several West Indian Islands except Jamaica was set up in 1920 and a Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established in 1939. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889. In March, 1956, revised constitutions were introduced in each of the four islands.

Land Policy

There is a small amount of Crown land reserved mainly for purposes of forest and water conservation. There is no restriction on the transfer of land except to aliens, for which the consent of the Governor in Executive Council is necessary.

Currency

The currency comprises dollar notes ($1 = 4s. 2d.) and British coinage. Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 in denominations of $1, $2, $5,
$10, $20 and $100, when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, and Trinidad) in currency unification.

Legislation has been enacted in the Windward Islands to provide for the reciprocal legal tender of currency notes of the Government of Jamaica and the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean.

Development

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955 the Windward Islands received an allocation of £3,250,000. This was sub-allocated to the various colonies as follows:

| Colony     | Allocation |
|------------|------------|
| St. Lucia  | £130,000   |
| Dominica   | £820,000   |
| Grenada    | £540,000   |
| St. Vincent| £540,000   |

A sum of £220,000 was reserved by the Governor for schemes covering more than one territory and for unforeseen contingencies.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

In each of the principal towns of the four Islands of the Group there is a free public library and there are several branch libraries throughout the Islands, all maintained by Government. The Dominica Museum, the only one in the Windward Islands, possesses a fine collection of pictures, specimens of birds and fishes and relics of the original Caribs.

Health

The principal diseases are malaria, enteric fever, helminthic diseases, yaws, venereal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis and dysentery.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, in co-operation with the World Health Organization, have made grants towards the implementation of insect control programmes in St. Lucia and Grenada. Applications have been submitted for the carrying out of similar projects in Dominica and St. Vincent.

Communications

Airfields have been constructed in Grenada and St. Lucia, and these two colonies are served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule. A temporary service with Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft is operated by the St. Vincent Government between Trinidad, Grenada, Carriacou, Barbados, St. Vincent and Dominica.

Broadcasting

The Windward Islands Broadcasting Service, with headquarters in St. George's, Grenada, was inaugurated in 1955. Transmissions will take place on short-waves from a 5-kW transmitter, and will cover all four Islands.

The capital outlay on these stations, and the running costs for the first few years, have been provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

DOMINICA

Area and Population

The area is approximately 305 square miles, and the estimated population is 59,000.

Geographical Features

Dominica is very mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island. The island is well-watered.

Climate

The climate on the whole is good. During the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

History

Dominica was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd July, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1761, and by the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the garrison. In 1783 it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

Until 1940 Dominica was grouped with the Leeward Islands.
Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. This follows the lines of those already in force in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council will be recognised as the "principal instrument of policy" and the Governor and Administrator will normally accept the Council's advice unless he deems it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, will comprise three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he will, however, have no vote. Since the President will have a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator will have no original vote, the elected members will thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There will be three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

The Minister for Trade and Production;
The Minister for Communications and Works;
The Minister for Social Services;
each of whom will be responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters will remain with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of all members of the Civil Service will be the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, to be advised by a non-political Public Service Commission to be established in the Colony.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are income tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 2½d. to 10s. in the £ of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 6s. on every £ of chargeable income. Ad valorem duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 5% to 35% preferential and 3% to 75% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Export duty, at a varying rate, is payable on most products exported. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars and black leaf tobacco.

Of the total revenue in 1954 £1,196,278 was derived from Customs, £254,804 from Taxes and £81,250 from Fees of Court, etc.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Education £279,127, Medical £262,296, Police £195,020, Public Works £424,454. Prior to 1940 Governor, Legislature, Audit and Judicial were borne by the Federal Government, Leeward Islands.

Development Plans

The Colony has been allocated £774,120 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945, for the ten-year period ending 31st March, 1956. Development Schemes fall into six main heads on which commitments are as follows:

- Agriculture and Forestry: £148,049
- Public Works: £334,659
- Education: £95,194
- Medical: £52,844
- Social Welfare: £15,982
- Miscellaneous: £127,392

In addition to the above, the Colony is engaged upon a further programme of Public Works amounting to £205,000 financed from Loan Funds, as set out below:

- Ferro-concrete Jetty at Roseau: £350,400
- Goodwill Housing Scheme (Town expansion and slum clearance): £177,600
- Prison and Police Barracks and Fire Station: £115,200
- Roads: £302,400
- Packing Plant: £24,000
- Unallocated: £14,400

There is a large new construction programme of Public Works which may be further increased. A fair portion of the Development and Welfare Funds allocated to Agriculture, Education and to Medical programmes are for building construction of offices, officers' quarters, schools, etc., which have to be built by the Public Works Department.

A further allocation of £820,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act has been made to Dominica.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation is engaged on development of Melville Hall Estate, in the northern part of the island. They completed the construction of a hydro-electric plant near Roseau early in 1953.
Education

There are 46 Elementary Schools with a total enrolment of 11,578 pupils, and four Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 843 pupils. There are also eight private or temporary schools with an enrolment of 529 pupils. There is no technical school nor any local institution of Higher Education. The number of students from this Colony known to be in Universities or University Colleges abroad is:

- United Kingdom: 23
- Canada: 4
- Jamaica (University College of the West Indies): 8
- Trinidad (I.C.T.A.): 2
- France: 1
- Belgium: 1

In 1954 Government expenditure on Education was $279,127 as compared with $35,976 in 1935.

Health

There are five Government hospitals including a Leper Home with a total of 183 beds. The latest available annual figure for out-patients is 7,262 and for in-patients 2,753. Regular clinics are held throughout the year by District Medical Officers at the 20 dispensaries distributed all over the island. A Maternal, Child Hygiene and School Health Service with its Headquarters in Roseau is operated by a Senior Health Visitor, assisted by three Health Visitors, under the direction of the Senior Medical Officer. As part of its functions the clinic distributes free milk, cod liver oil and food yeast to needy and undernourished children. Under a U.N.I.C.E.F. school feeding programme, all children in primary schools receive a half-pint of reconstituted milk daily. There are also an Anti-Yaws Campaign and a Dental Service.

The Health Department with its auxiliary the Public Health Engineering Unit is under the control of the Senior Medical Officer who is also Chairman of the Central Board of Health. This Board is statutorily constituted and is responsible to Government for the initiation and carrying out of public health measures.

Government expenditure on medical and allied services in 1954 was $299,461 compared with $19,243 in 1936.

Communications

The amphibian aircraft of the St. Vincent Government service use the sheltered harbour at Portsmouth.

Sailing and motor vessels connect Dominica with most of the smaller West Indian islands.

The following steamship lines call at Roseau: Canadian National, Harrison, Alcoa, Furness Withy, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique and Royal Netherlands Steamships Limited.

There are 102 miles of oiled surface roads, 2,500 miles of secondary roads and 326 miles of tracks. An extensive programme of road development is being carried out.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture is the principal occupation and provides employment for about 5,000 wage-earners in addition to about 3,000 peasants. Road and building construction workers are estimated at 2,000. There are two trade unions with an estimated membership of 5,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are limes, bananas, coconuts, grapefruit, oranges, cocoa, vanilla, mangoes, avocado pears and various ground provisions for domestic use. The main products are raw and sweetened lime juice, lime oil, copra and rum.

The livestock population consists of about 4,000 head of cattle. A Government stock farm has been established in order to stimulate expansion of the livestock industry.

There is considerable production of timber for local use, but no export trade.

The production of handicrafts from local straws is a widespread minor industry. The annual value of production is estimated at $36,000.

GRENA DA

Area

The total area is 133 square miles. The Colony includes certain of the small islands known as the Grenadines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area of about 13 square miles.

Population

The estimated population (mid-1954) of 85,300 is for the most part “coloured”. There is a small white population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers.

Geographical Features

In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat disordered topography of mountains and fairly deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of mountains traverses the whole length, closer to the western than the eastern coastline. The highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), Fedon’s Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along the east and south-east the mountains slope gradually towards the sea. The south coast is deeply indented by numerous natural harbours. The island is well-watered by quick-flowing streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approximately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800 feet in the centre of the Island.

Climate

Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month, and November the wettest.

History

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. Grenada was, however, included in the Carlisle Grant of 1627. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased the island from the French West India Company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George’s. This venture did not pay and Du Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac from whom it was in turn purchased in 1665 by the French Company and passed to the Crown of France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 and re-occupied in 1784. In 1795–96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. Many atrocities were committed, including the cold-blooded murder of the Lieutenant-Governor. The rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there has been peace in Grenada.

Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. This follows the lines of those already in force in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council will be recognised as the “principal instrument of policy” and the Governor and Administrator will normally accept the Council’s advice unless he deems it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, will comprise three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor’s absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion...
of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he will, however, have no vote. Since the President will have a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator will have no original vote, the elected members will thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There will be three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

The Minister for Trade and Production;
The Minister for Communications and Works;
The Minister for Social Services;

each of whom will be responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters will remain with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of all members of the Civil Service will be the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, to be advised by a non-political Public Service Commission to be established in the Colony.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

Forms of direct taxation include income tax, estate duties and land and house tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale of 3% to 60%, in the $ for individuals, companies paying a special rate of 37½% in the $. An agreement was reached in 1949 with various Governments for the avoidance of double taxation. Taxation is enforced in other forms through import, export and excise duties, licences, etc.

At the end of 1954 the estimated Public Debt amounted to $2,859,900 and accumulated Sinking Funds to $846,450.

Development Plans

Grenada received an original allocation of $1,833,071 (£381,890) under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a Ten-Year Development Plan. Between 1946 and 1953 this amount was augmented by a further sum of $1,004,309 making a total figure of $2,837,381 (£591,121). This includes an additional grant of £20,000 from the Windwards General Allocation.

At the end of 1953 the position of these grants was:

- C.D. & W. Allocation: £591,121
- Expenditure:
  - Agriculture: £301,832
  - Education: £62,544
  - Medical: £10,461

A further allocation of £540,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act has been made to Grenada.

Other Development

It has not so far been possible to attract the assistance of any organization of suitable capacity by way of investing in any desirable major development scheme at present beyond the competence of the Colony to finance. One such scheme is the development of the Morne Rouge area in the interest of tourism.

Education

There are 53 Primary Schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 18,446. Average attendance in 1954 was 14,423 or 78.2%. Compulsory attendance is enforced in the capital and one other area where accommodation is regarded as adequate. Twelve of the Primary Schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned structures of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are three handicraft centres. In addition two schools have well-equipped handicraft rooms. There are also three domestic science centres, with adequate facilities provided at two other schools. A visual education unit serves the whole colony. A filmstrip library service with four projectors is maintained. Six Secondary Schools (one Government and five grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,241. Two of the schools are for boys only, three for girls only and one co-educational. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate standard and the Grenada Boys Secondary School, the
Presentation College and the St. Joseph’s Convent also prepare pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The estimated cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1954 was $523,570. In 1935 the total expenditure on education amounted to $73,080.

The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships, one tenable at a university in the British Commonwealth, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad.

Health

There have been no epidemics of infectious diseases recently. Malaria is still prevalent, but with the assistance of W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. organizations, an Insect Control Programme is now in operation. The Colony Hospital is at St. George’s. One medical officer is engaged in a yaws and venereal disease campaign. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew’s, is a modern building recently constructed, and provides 32 beds. There is another small hospital at Carriacou. There are 22 district medical visiting stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Here, too, maternity and child welfare work is done. There are two main Health Centres—St. George’s and Gouyave—and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.

Estimated expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1954 amounted to $659,507 compared with $97,987 in 1935.

Communications

The airfield is at Pearls, and has a runway 5,280 feet long and 150 feet wide.

There are approximately 472 miles of good roads divided into four classes according to standard of construction. About 234 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.

The chief ports are St. George’s (possessing a good harbour and a deep water pier), Grenville and Hillsborough (Carriacou). Cargo services are operated by the Harrison Line steamers from the United Kingdom and by calls of the Canadian National Steamship Company and the Alcoa Line from Canadian and United States ports. The Canadian National Line and Caribbean Fruit Company boats also carry passengers. Several small motor, auxiliary and sailing vessels ply regularly between the islands.

*Bunches

Nutmeg estates, coconut trees, breadfruit trees and bananas suffered heavy damage and destruction in the hurricane in September, 1955, and the effect of the hurricane will be felt for many years to come. As nutmegs and cocoa are the major export crops, the magnitude of Grenada’s long-term problem becomes apparent.

The chief imports are foodstuffs, iron and steel, timber, textiles and cement.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Government-operated Central Marketing Organization was initiated in 1951 for the purchase, sale and, where necessary, storage of surplus
quantities of locally grown foodcrops. The nutmeg industry is controlled by the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association which purchases, processes and markets all nutmegs and mace produced in the Colony.

Six co-operatives were registered in 1954, and there are a number of small co-operative societies and two estate buying clubs in operation.

ST. LUCIA

Area and Population

The area is 238 square miles and the population 86,219 (1954 end-year estimate).

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, with magnificent scenery. The highest peak is Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet); the most spectacular are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September–October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

History

The date and the person who discovered St. Lucia are unknown, for according to the known evidence of Columbus's voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April, 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June, 1803, was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

**Constitution**

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. This follows the lines of those already in force in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council will be recognised as the "principal instrument of policy" and the Governor and Administrator will normally accept the Council's advice unless he deems it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, will comprise three *ex officio* members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he will, however, have no vote. Since the President will have a casting vote only and, whenever the Governor is present the Administrator will have no original vote, the elected members will thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There will be three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

- The Minister for Trade and Production;
- The Minister for Communications and Works;
- The Minister for Social Services;

each of whom will be responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters will remain with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of all members of the Civil Service will be the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, to be advised by a non-political Public Service Commission to be established in the Colony.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two *ex officio* members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

**Taxation**

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 6d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 94,485     | 105,205        |
| 1950 | 674,059    | 741,238        |
| 1951 | 926,840    | 884,212        |
| 1952 | 850,209    | 723,472        |
| 1953 | 739,782    | 703,463        |
| 1954 | 825,409    | 767,392        |

It was estimated that in 1954 35·09% of revenue was derived from Customs and Excise duties, and 17·21% from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: £138,203
- Administration: £30,491
- Public Works: £112,165
- Development: £173,538

The Public Debt of the Colony at 31st December, 1954, stood at $3,261,094 which includes $2,782,281 loaned for Castries Reconstruction and $21,600 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds for Vide Boutielle Housing. The accumulated Sinking Funds towards its redemption stood at $313,332.

At 31st December, 1954, an amount of $42,945 was due by Her Majesty's Government to this Colony in respect of unreimbursed expenditure on Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes.

At 31st December, 1954, unrepaid loans from revenue amounted to $1,372,564.

**Development Plans**

Proposals for the implementation of the Team of Experts' Report on the Agricultural Development of St. Lucia, submitted by the Development
Commissioner, were approved by the Secretary of State in March, 1954. The proposals include provision for—

Livestock and Pasturage Improvement £621,829
Cocoa Propagation 28,495
Investigation and Development 21,661
Supplementary Agricultural Staff 56,874
Development of Timber Industry 12,536
Assistance to the Banana Industry 13,970
Lobster Industry 600
Maintenance and Operation of a Fish Farm 300
Loans to Producers' Association 13,000

The above-mentioned proposals are being financed from the allocation of £200,000 for Agricultural Development, recommended in the Team of Experts' Report.

Feeder road construction, financed from an allocation of £150,000 recommended by the Team of Experts, has also made considerable headway and some 14 miles of new roads and surfacing of existing tracks have already been completed.

A further allocation of £1,130,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act has been made at St. Lucia, and a revised Development Plan including provision of over £500,000 for agricultural and feeder road development is being prepared.

**Education**

In the 1953–54 session there was one student from St. Lucia at the University College of the West Indies, Jamaica. There were 22 students at Universities in the United Kingdom, seven in Canada and two in France. Of these 5 held Government scholarships, the balance being private students. There were two Secondary Schools with 655 pupils on the roll, and 49 Primary Schools with a total of 14,505 pupils enrolled. The Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies conducted adult education classes throughout the year, and the aggregate attendance was 2,084. The total estimated expenditure for 1954 was £62,756, compared with £6,692 in 1935.

**Health**

The most prevalent diseases are heart diseases, diseases of early infancy, tuberculosis, helminthic diseases, and venereal diseases.

The incidence of malaria has fallen sharply as a result of an Insect Control Campaign carried out with W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. assistance.

Available hospital beds amount to 168. There are 15 dispensaries and Health Outposts and a Day Nursery.

In 1953, 49,608 persons attended at clinics or health outposts. The estimated expenditure on medical and allied services in 1954 was £54,197, compared with £11,624 in 1935.

**Communications**

There are two airfields, the Vigie Airport, and the Beane Field Airport. Air services with the other islands are maintained by British West Indian Airways Incorporated, and chartered flights by K.L.M. and British Guiana Airways.

The island's road system comprises the following:

| Miles |
|-------|
| Main roads | 105·64 |
| Second Class Roads | 95·65 |
| Unclassified Roads | 169·85 |
| Total | 371·14 |

Cargo steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa Steamships, the Harrison Line, the Caribbean Fruit Company, and numerous inter-island craft are the main means of communication by sea. Castries handles about 945,000 gross tons of shipping annually.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture (17,000). Other gainful occupations are fishing (1,500), manufacturing (3,630), public services (1,199), lumbering (221), transportation (1,630), commerce (1,260), and domestic service (2,080).

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are sugar cane, coconuts, cocoa, cassava, bananas, fruit, vegetables, rice, cotton, and citrus.

Livestock estimates are: cattle 15,000, pigs 20,000, sheep 9,000, goats 7,000, horses, mules and donkeys 1,500, poultry 45,000.

Estimated timber extraction was 500,000 board feet.

There is a fair amount of fishing, but the supply does not meet the demand.

The principal manufactures are sugar, rum, citrus products, edible oils, cotton ginning, cigarettes, and mineral waters.

ST. VINCENT

Area

The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population

The estimated population at the end of 1954 was 75,190.

Geographical Features

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufriere (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 87 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At Kingstown, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 85·8°, and the rainfall 104·17 inches, in 1953.

History

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent, and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British 14 years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in 1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. This follows the lines of those already in force in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council will be recognised as the "principal instrument of policy" and the Governor and Administrator will normally accept the Council's advice unless he deems it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, will comprise three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he will, however, have no vote. Since the President will have a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator will have no original vote, the elected members will thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.
(c) There will be three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

The Minister for Trade and Production;
The Minister for Communications and Works;
The Minister for Social Services;
each of whom will be responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters will remain with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of all members of the Civil Service will be the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, to be advised by a non-political Public Service Commission to be established in the colony.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 78 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 30 cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 14s. 2d. per proof gallon.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue B.W.I. | Expenditure B.W.I. |
|------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1938 | 489,677        | 464,458            |
| 1950 | 1,784,347      | 1,919,991          |
| 1951 | 2,183,392      | 2,317,061          |
| 1952 | 2,113,384      | 2,105,005          |
| 1953 | 2,790,712      | 2,618,773          |
| 1954 | 3,061,693      | 2,846,026          |

In 1954 Customs and excise duties produced $1,186,822 (or 38·76%) of the total revenue while direct taxation yielded $322,570 (or 10·5%).

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Medical: $409,634
- Education: $334,310
- Police: $187,700

The Public Debt at 31st December, 1954, was $637,875, equivalent to $8·50 per head of the population.

Development Plans

The Ten-Year Development Plan, compiled in 1946, has been revised and replaced by the Five-Year Plan, 1955-60. It is hoped that the sum of £360,000 will be made available from public loans, and some £600,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds (including a further allocation of £540,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act). These funds will be spent in the following proportions:

- Communications: 65%
- Social Services: 24%
- Economic Development: 11%

Education

In 1954 there were two Government Secondary Schools and one grant-aided Secondary School with an enrolment of 559 pupils and 42 Primary Schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 16,249 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions. Three Government teacher-training establishments have a total enrolment of 231 pupils.

During 1953-54 some 32 St. Vincent students were attending Universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1954 expenditure on educational services amounted to approximately $334,310, of which the contribution of the United Kingdom under Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $3,524. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

Health

Of tropical diseases yaws is prevalent, and tuberculosis is a major health problem but does not appear to be increasing (average deaths over a five-year period were 53 annually). Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 20 dispensaries. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery): 134
- Maternity: 16
- Tuberculosis: 40
- Mental: 100
- Leprosy: 20
- Pauper Home: 125

In 1954 in-patients numbered 4,432; out-patients, 9,230.

Total expenditure in 1954 on Government Health and Medical Services was $420,656; in 1935, $66,945.

Communications

The seadrome is situated at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown.

There are about 400 miles of roads of which some 100 miles are motorable throughout the year; 58 miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 27 miles of metalled roads and about 325 miles of earth roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly cargo service is provided from Canada, by the Canadian National Steamship Company, with limited passenger accommodation. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service every six weeks by the Harrison Line. The Alcoa Steamships call southbound from Canada fortnightly via the islands and proceed to New York approximately every five weeks. The Caribbean Fruit Company have recently started a passenger and cargo service which operates between Trinidad, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Barbados. Schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.
Principal Occupations

The working population is estimated to be some 30,000, about 50% of whom are engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.

Trade Unions

| Trade Union                                      | Membership |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| The United Workers', Peasants' and Rate-payers' Union | 1,100      |
| The General Workers' Union                       | 50         |
| The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers' Union | 2,500      |
| The Civil Service Association                    |            |
| The Teachers' Association                        | 300        |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are arrowroot, cotton, copra and coconut, sugar, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, bananas and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is: goats 11,000; cattle 7,750; sheep 3,300; horses and mules 250; swine 9,400.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

There is fairly extensive fishing in-shore but very little is done off-shore. Catches are often insufficient to meet demand.

A Central Arrowroot Factory with modern equipment has been erected. There are a good many privately-owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a soap and cigarette factory; an oil expressing and refining plant for cotton seed and coconut oil, with their by-products of stock feed and manure, and a deodorizing plant for the treatment of coconut and fish oils at the Government Cotton Ginnery; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks.
