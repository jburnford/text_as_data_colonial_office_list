FEDERATION OF NIGERIA

Area

Of the total area of 373,250 square miles, the Colony comprises 1,381 and the Protectorate 371,869 (including 34,081 in the Cameroons Trust Territory). The country is divided into the Northern, Eastern and Western Regions, the quasi-Federal territory of the Southern Cameroons and the Federal territory of Lagos. The northern portion of the Cameroons Trust Territory is administered as part of the Northern Region.

The areas are:

| Region                  | Square Miles |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Northern Region         | 281,782      |
| Western Region          | 43,376       |
| Eastern Region          | 29,484       |
| Southern Cameroons      | 16,581       |
| Lagos                   | 27           |

Population

A census of the country was carried out in three stages: the Northern Region in July 1952, the Western Region (including Lagos) in December 1952 and the Eastern Region (including the Southern Cameroons) in June 1953. The population based on this census, amounted to 31,171,000 distributed as follows:—Northern Region 16,840,000; Eastern Region 7,218,000; Western Region 6,088,000; Southern Cameroons 753,000; and Lagos 272,000. The total non-African population is approximately 15,000. The main tribal groups are:—Fulani 3,023,000, Hausa 5,488,000, Yoruba 4,508,000, Ibo 4,944,000. These are the known figures for each group within the Region it mainly inhabits and exclude minorities living in other Regions. Population is densest between Lagos and Ibadan in the West and around Kano in the North.

Principal Towns

Lagos, with a population of 272,000, is the Federal capital. The Regional capitals are Kaduna (Northern), Ibadan (Western), and Enugu (Eastern) with populations of approximately 51,000, 459,000 and 63,000 respectively.
The headquarters of the Southern Cameroons is at Bua. The approximate populations of other towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants are:

**Northern Region**
- Kano 130,000; Yerwa/Maiduguri 57,000; Zaria 54,000.

**Western Region**
- Ogbomosho 140,000; Oshogbo 123,000; Ife 111,000; Iwo 100,000; Abeokuta 84,000; Ilesha 72,000; Oyo 72,000; Benin 54,000.

**Eastern Region**
- Onitsha 77,000; Port Harcourt 72,000; Enugu 63,000; Aba 58,000.

**Geographical Features**

There are four main zones, each stretching across the country from east to west and corresponding closely to the annual rainfall. This falls from as much as 200 inches in the south-east to as little as 20 inches in the north. The four zones are:

(i) A belt of creeks and mangrove swamps along the coast, which includes the Niger delta. It extends anything from 10 to 60 miles inland.

(ii) A well-watered belt of dense tropical forest from 50 to 100 miles wide. It is rich in oil palms and cacao.

(iii) A belt of park-like land with savannahs of high grass, and largely uninhabited because of tsetse fly.

(iv) A vast undulating plateau about 2,000 feet high, with occasional hills of granite and sandstone sometimes rising to over 5,000 feet. The northern half of this is free of tsetse fly, and carries a heavy stock of nomadic cattle. This area also produces groundnuts and cotton.

The Cameroons Mountain (13,350 ft.) is a volcano, and was last active in 1922. There are 2,600 square miles of land over 5,000 feet and 193,000 square miles over 1,000 feet. The main rivers (with length in Nigeria) are as follows: Niger, 730 miles; Benue, 495 miles; Sokoto, 390 miles; Kaduna, 340 miles; Cross, 335 miles and Dongola, 330 miles.

Lake Chad, the only important lake, has an area of 1,850 square miles. There are 119,431 square miles of forest (constituting 31.9% of the total area of the country) and 30,504 square miles of forest Reserve.

**Climate**

There is a dry season, roughly from November to April and a rainy season, which is longer in the south than the north and later in the east than the west. The wettest months in the north are August and September and in the south, June, July and August. Average annual rainfalls are:—Kaduna, 2,000 feet above sea level, 52 inches; Enugu, 600 feet above sea level, 71 inches; Ibadan, 600 feet above sea level, 48 inches. The annual average temperature is everywhere about 80°. In the south the temperature varies very little; in the north it may rise as high as 110° but the nights are cool.

**History**

As far back as the seventeenth century British traders had mercantile depôts on the mouths of the Niger and adjacent rivers and creeks, trade until the nineteenth century being mainly in slaves. Journeys were not undertaken into the interior, however, until the era of exploration which began with the formation in London of an African Association in 1788. The Association directed its attention to solving the mystery of the "Great River" which was known to flow through much of West Africa. Thanks to the journeys of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, it was demonstrated in 1830 that the many rivers flowing into the Bight of Benin were, in fact, the delta of the Niger.

Under the inspiration of MacGregor Laird and others, efforts then began to use the Niger as a commercial highway into the interior. They were not on the whole successful, but British and other firms maintained stations in the delta chiefly to trade for palm oil. The energy and vision of Sir George Goldie led to an amalgamation of the British firms into a single company, and the new company developed its trade to such effect that opposing interests were all bought out. At the Berlin conference in 1885 the British claim to a sphere of influence over the Niger districts was accordingly recognized.

The British company, now given a charter and re-named the Royal Niger Company, proceeded to extend its influence into the interior by treaties with local rulers. There was friction with French interests but in 1898 the British and French Governments signed a convention regulating boundaries. In 1900 the administrative rights and powers of the Royal Niger Company were taken over by the Crown.

Until 1914 the country was administered in two parts—the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. The Colony comprised a small area around Lagos which had been annexed in 1862 as a base for operations against the slave trade. From 1900 to 1903 the authorities in Northern Nigeria were engaged in bringing under control the powerful emirates of the Hausa states and the Kanuri kingdom of Bornu which maintained large standing armies used for slave raiding.

In 1914 Northern and Southern Nigeria were amalgamated to form a Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. At the end of the 1914–18 war part of the adjacent territory of the German Cameroons (which had been occupied by Anglo-French forces) was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as part of Nigeria. Following the formation of the United Nations the Cameroons became a Trusteeship Territory.

**Constitution**

On the 1st of October, 1954, Nigeria became a Federation, its government being provided for by the Nigeria (Constitution) Order in Council, 1954.

This Order provides for a Council of Ministers comprising the Governor-General as President and ten Ministers (three from each Region and one from the Southern Cameroons) and three ex officio Members, namely the Chief Secretary of the Federation, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Financial Secretary of the Federation.

There is a House of Representatives for the Federation, consisting of the Speaker and 184 elected members, 92 elected by the Northern Region, 42 elected by the Western Region, 42 elected by the Eastern Region, six elected by the Southern Cameroons and two by Lagos. There may be special Members, not exceeding six, appointed by the Governor-General to represent...
communities and interests not otherwise adequately represented and in addition, the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary of the Federation are *ex officio* members of the House of Representatives.

Elections to the House of Representatives were completed in December 1954. The strength of the main parties in the House is:

- Northern Peoples' Congress (N.P.C.) 89 seats
- National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (N.C.N.C.) ... 60 seats
- Action Group/United National Independence Party alliance ... 27 seats
- Kamerun National Congress (K.N.C.) ... 6 seats
- Others ... ... ... 2 seats

The N.C.N.C. won a majority of seats in the Eastern and Western Regions and so has six Ministers in the Council of Ministers; the N.P.C. won a majority of seats in the Northern Region and has three Ministers; and the remaining central Minister belongs to the K.N.C. which won all the seats in the Southern Cameroons.

Each Region has its own Executive Council under the Regional Governor. In the Northern Region, in addition to the Ministers, there are three *ex officio* Members in the Council.

In the Northern and Western Regions there are two-chamber systems of Government, consisting in each case of a House of Chiefs and a House of Assembly. In the Eastern Region there is a House of Assembly only and the Members are all elected. The Members of the Western House of Assembly are all elected, with the exception of three Special Members who may be appointed by the Governor of the Region. In the Northern Region the Members of the House of Assembly are all elected except for four *ex officio* Members and five Special Members who are appointed by the Governor of the Region.

The Southern Cameroons has an Executive Council, comprising the Commissioner of the Cameroons as President, three *ex officio* Members, and four unofficial Members whom the Governor-General appoints from among the members of the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons. A majority (thirteen) of the Members of the House of Assembly are elected. The remaining Members are the Commissioner of the Cameroons as President, three *ex officio* Members, six Native Authority Members, and not more than two Special Members, who are appointed by the Governor-General.

The N.P.C. is the majority party in the Northern House of Assembly, the N.C.N.C. in the Eastern House of Assembly, the Action Group in the Western House of Assembly, and the K.N.C. in the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons.

Elections to the Federal House of Representatives are completely separate from the elections to the Regional and Southern Cameroons Houses of Assembly. The method of election to the Federal Legislature varies with the Regions. In the Northern Region and the Southern Cameroons the basic principle of election is through electoral colleges. In the Western Region the Federal elections in 1954 were based on elections by ballot for all tax-payers, with no age qualification. In the Eastern Region universal adult suffrage was introduced for Federal elections. In the Western and Eastern Regions and in Lagos voting was by secret ballot with the use of symbols. Elections to the Regional Houses of Assembly follow the same pattern, although they are subject to such variation as circumstances require.

The executive authority of the Federation extends to all matters in respect of which the Federal Legislature has power to make laws. Under the 1954 Constitution certain subjects became exclusively a matter for the Federal Legislature. Such subjects include External Affairs, Aviation, Banks, Census, Customs, Defence, Police, Maritime Shipping, Mines and Minerals, Posts and Telegraphs, Trunk Roads and Railways. In addition there is a Concurrent List of subjects which may be dealt with by the Regional Legislatures as well as by the Federal Legislature, although in the event of inconsistency Federal law prevails. All subjects which are not included in the Federal or Concurrent Lists are matters within the exclusive executive and legislative competence of the Regional Governments.

**Land Policy**

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives. There is a small amount of Crown land acquired mainly for public purposes.

**Taxation**

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and general tax. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for non-natives throughout Nigeria, and natives in the township of Lagos, to pay a graduated income tax ranging from 4½d. in every £ of the first £200 to 15s. in the £ for every £ exceeding £10,000. There are special rates for incomes which do not exceed £150. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. In 1948 an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom Government for the avoidance of double taxation.

General tax is paid by natives outside the township of Lagos, assessed in a variety of ways from the individual assessment of wealthy traders in large towns to a flat rate in backward areas.

The other principal source of revenue is from import, export and excise duties.

### Public Finance

| Year   | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39 | 5,811,087   | 6,867,409       |
| 1950–51 | 32,793,633  | 30,388,203      |
| 1951–52 | 50,326,501  | 43,672,899      |

| 1954–55 | 62,480,539  | 60,668,346      |

In 1954–55 £43,960,303 of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and £6,713,032 from direct taxes.
The Public Debt at the end of March 1955 amounted to £19,506,641 (approximately 12s. 6d. per head of population) comprising:

- **1923—4% Loan (1963)**: £5,700,000
- **1946—3½% Loan (1956–61)**: £300,000
- **1947—2½% Loan (1966–71)**: £1,250,000

- **1951—3½% Loan (1964–66)**: £6,800,000
- **Loan from Cocoa Marketing Board**: £2,456,641

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s., and 10s.; alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d.; bronze coins of 1d., ½d. and tenth penny. Nickel coins of 1d., ½d. and tenth penny continue to circulate but are withdrawn on presentation to banks. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development Plans**

Nigeria has received a total allocation of £13,080,000 for the period 1955–60 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955. This sum, which is additional to the unspent balance of the allocations made in respect of the period 1951–56, is divided as follows:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Federal Government | 3,750,000 |
| Northern Region   | 4,750,000 |
| Eastern Region    | 2,750,000 |
| Western Region    | 500,000   |
| Southern Cameroons | 1,330,000 |

In addition, direct grants made under the Higher Education allocation of the 1955 Act include £300,000 to the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology and £150,000 to the University College, Ibadan.

In view of the impending conclusion of the ten-year Plan of Development initiated in 1946, preparations for a further plan were set in train in 1954. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was invited to send a Mission to Nigeria to appraise the economic development prospects of the territory and to recommend practical measures for their realization. The Mission's report was published in September 1954, but the increased responsibilities which devolved upon Regional Governments as a result of the constitutional changes in 1954 have necessitated the preparation of separate plans by the Federal and Regional Governments.

The Federal Government, pending a full examination of the International Bank Mission's Report, sought the approval of the Legislature for an Interim Development Plan, "Development Finance, 1955–56", and this was accepted by the House of Representatives in April 1955. This Plan comprises those projects which are demonstrably urgent and in harmony with the recommendations of the International Bank Mission and it involves a total capital expenditure of £22,318,860, of which some £6,500,000 will probably be spent in 1955–56.

The more important capital projects included in this Plan are: the development of education in Lagos, including the introduction of free primary education; improved hospital and other medical facilities in Lagos; the improvement of postal and telecommunication facilities throughout Nigeria; the improvement of the Federal road system; the construction of additional wharf space at Port Harcourt; and slum clearance and other town planning projects in Lagos. This Interim Development Plan will be embodied in an Economic Programme, 1955–60, which is at present being prepared by the Federal Government.

After giving full consideration to the recommendations contained in the International Bank Mission's Report, the Northern Regional Government has estimated that the total revenue available from all sources to meet all expenditure in the Region over the period 1955–60 will be approximately £89,000,000. In the light of this estimate a development programme has been framed, details of which are contained in a White Paper entitled "A Statement of Policy on the Development Finance Programme of the Northern Region of Nigeria, 1955–60". The programme includes the following major items:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Education, general and technical | 17,000,000 |
| Roads, construction and improvement | 10,000,000 |
| Agriculture | 9,700,000 |
| Medical and Health | 9,585,000 |
| Public Works | 9,500,000 |
| Water Supplies, rural and urban | 4,500,000 |
| Veterinary | 2,000,000 |

**Note.**—These figures include both capital and recurrent expenditure on each item under the Regional budget during the five-year period.

The Government of the Eastern Region has published an "Outline of Development Plan, 1955–60" (Sessional Paper No. 4 of 1955), in which it is estimated that £5,200,000 will be available for development projects during that period. The major categories of expenditure envisaged are:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Rural Water Supplies | 1,750,000 |
| Education | 1,000,000 |
| Improvement of Roads and Bridges | 804,200 |
| Health | 500,000 |

The Government of the Southern Cameroons has published an "Outline Plan of Development and Welfare, 1955–60" (Sessional Paper No. 2 of 1955), which envisages expenditure of over £1,500,000, including the following main items:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Road Development | 659,000 |
| Education | 323,000 |
| Agriculture (including Fisheries) | 230,000 |
| Medical (including Leprosy) | 145,000 |

The Government of the Western Region has estimated that the total revenue available from all sources to meet all expenditure by the Regional Government over the period 1955–60 will be approximately £104,860,000. Of this it is estimated that about £34,332,000 will be spent on capital works, including the following main items:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Education | 7,621,000 |
| Water Supplies (Rural and Urban) | 5,060,000 |
| Roads | 4,000,000 |
| Health | 2,169,000 |
| Electricity | 1,000,000 |

The capital expenditure figure also includes grants amounting to £6,750,000 to the Regional Production Development Board and to the Regional Finance Corporation. Details of the Development Plan are set out in Sessional Paper No. 4 of 1955 entitled "Development of the Western Region of Nigeria, 1955–60".
On the recommendation of the International Bank Mission, a National Economic Council has been formed in order that the Federal and Regional Governments may meet to discuss the many economic problems common to each, notwithstanding their separate constitutional functions and such of their development policies as may have consequences reaching beyond their respective constitutional spheres. The first meeting of the Council was held in Lagos in October 1955.

Other Development

The Production Development Boards in the Western Region and the Southern Cameroons and the Development Corporations which have succeeded the former Production Development Boards in the Northern and Eastern Regions, are devoting large sums of money to the improvement of production methods for both food and export crops which is so essential to the well-being of the country. They include the operation of oil mills in the west and east, the distribution of artificial fertilizers, particularly in the north, a survey of cocoa soils, the establishment of a 20,000 acre cattle ranch in the east and schemes for mechanizing rice cultivation. They are also spending large sums on roads. The Government has also set up a Development Board at Lagos to provide roads and services near Apapa Wharf to which the Colonial Development Corporation is lending £1 million. The most important industrial plants, other than the Nigerian Tobacco Company at Ibadan and the plywood and veneer factory at Sapele, are the spinning and weaving mills at Kano and Lagos and the ceramic factory at Ikorodu, near Lagos, which supplies a large proportion of domestic pottery requirements. Plant for the manufacture of cement is in process of establishment at Nkalagu, in the Eastern Region. Finance Corporations which have been established in the Eastern and Western Regions and the Development Corporation in the Northern Region are empowered to make loans for development purposes.

Education

On the 1st October 1954, on the revision of the Constitution, Education became the responsibility of Regional Governments and the Government of the Southern Cameroons, the Federal Government retaining responsibility for education in Lagos and for those institutions of higher learning which have Nigerian significance, such as the University College at Ibadan, the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, King's College and the Man O'War Bay Training Centre. The number of children in both primary and secondary schools has expanded considerably, particularly in the Western Region where £2,500,000 was spent on buildings to accommodate the large number of new pupils following the introduction in January 1955 of free education for all primary school children within the 6-12 year age group. At the end of 1955 there were approximately 1,277,000 children attending primary schools throughout the Federation and there were 156 Teacher Training Institutions with provision for the training of 10,400 teachers. Secondary education continued to develop at the normal rate with 162 secondary schools catering for about 30,000 pupils and with one Technical Institute and eight Trade Centres catering for 1,630 apprentices and trainees.

There are 511 Nigerian students at the University College, Ibadan. A University College Teaching Hospital at Ibadan will, it is hoped, be operating fully by 1957. The three branches of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology at Zaria, Ibadan and Enugu had, by the end of 1955, a total enrolment of 393 students.

In the Eastern Region an enabling measure for the establishment of a University was enacted during 1955.

The number of Federal Government scholarship awards in 1954 was 204, with an additional 18 awards to Nigerians already studying overseas. The Regional Governments also awarded a large proportion of scholarships for study overseas. It is estimated that there were about 2,350 Nigerian private students overseas in 1954, of whom approximately 300 were in North America and the remainder in the United Kingdom. There were also a few students in India and the West Indies.

Libraries and Museums

Lagos has a Municipal Library and other libraries are maintained by the Federal and Regional Information Services and by the United States Information Service. Travelling library schemes have also been organized.

There is a National Museum at Lagos and there are local museums at Jos, Ife, Oron and Benin.

Health

With the introduction of the 1954 Constitution medical and health matters became the responsibility of the Regional Governments and the Government of the Southern Cameroons, the Federal Government retaining responsibility for medical and health matters in Lagos.

The principal diseases are malaria, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, cerebro-spinal meningitis, pneumonia, smallpox, leprosy, yaws, tuberculosis, dysentery, venereal diseases, intestinal parasites, filariasis, onchocerciasis, elephantiasis and tropical ulcers. Intensive vaccination campaigns were carried out in 1954 and considerable progress was made in the fight against leprosy.

Hospitals (excluding those for infectious diseases number 142 and there are 419 Maternity Centres, 9 Rural Health Centres and over 1,000 Dispensaries. There are approximately 12,313 beds available in hospitals.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1954-55 was estimated at £4,135,000 compared with £458,384 in 1938-39.

Communications

Kano and Lagos are international airports and there are 14 other airfields regularly used by the internal services of the West African Airways Corporation. The Corporation also operates services connecting Lagos with the other British West African territories, Dakar and Khartoum. The international services of B.O.A.C., Air France, Sabena, Swissair and other airlines connect Nigeria with London, Western Europe, the Union of South Africa and French West and Equatorial Africa. More than 150,000 passengers used the international airports in 1954, approximately half of these being in transit. Full meteorological forecasting stations are established at Kano and Lagos under the control of the British West African Meteorological Service with headquarters at Lagos.
The Nigerian Railway, which is now controlled by the Nigerian Railway Corporation, carried 5,451,000 passengers in 1954-55 and 2,602,000 tons of freight. Route mileage totals 1,903 and track mileage 2,218, plus 133 miles of narrow gauge.

There are 31,184 miles of motorable road. Most of the roads have a gravel or earth surface but approximately 2,022 miles have been tarred.

The main ports are Lagos and Port Harcourt, and there are smaller ports at Calabar, Burutu, Sapele, Warri, Victoria and Tiko. Services for passengers and cargo from the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines Limited, which operates a regular fortnightly passenger service, Palm Line Limited, John Holt Line Limited and Elders and Fyffes. Cargo services are also operated from Scandinavian ports by Hoegh Line and Scandinavian West Africa Line.

The Nigerian Government maintains a service carrying passengers and coal between Lagos and Port Harcourt while there is a regular monthly service linking Lagos, Calabar and Victoria provided by Elder Dempster Lines. This company and the Palm Line also provide irregular services linking other coastal ports while a Spanish concern links Calabar and Fernando Po.

The river Niger and its chief tributary, the river Benue, are the principal inland water highways. The Niger is navigable for a distance of 537 miles upstream to Jebba and the Benue for 547 miles from Lokoja to Garua in the French Cameroons. Although the Benue and the upper reaches of the Niger are only navigable during a limited season at high water, both rivers provide an important alternative to the Nigerian Railway for the evacuation of produce. In all there are approximately 4,000 miles of navigable inland waterways in Nigeria.

Broadcasting

The Nigerian Broadcasting Service operates stations at Lagos (one 20 kW., one 1 kW. and one 0·3 kW.), Kaduna (one 7½ kW. and two 0·3 kW.), Enugu (one 2½ kW. and two 0·3 kW.) and Ibadan (one 1 kW. and one 0·3 kW.). There were 4,362 holders of wireless receiving licences at the end of 1954 with an estimated six listeners per receiver. The Government operates wired distribution systems in the Northern and Eastern Regions. In the Western Region and in Lagos the system is operated by a private company under licence. There were 52,369 subscribers to wired distribution services at the end of 1954.

Principal Occupations

By far the greater part of the working population is employed in agriculture, wage-earning agricultural employment being largely confined to plantations, although there is considerable seasonal wage-earning employment on the cocoa farms of the Western Region.

The following figures show the numbers employed in the principal industries where workers are regularly employed on a wage. The figures do not include the many persons working for small employers.

| Industry                  | Number |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture and livestock farming | 56,473 |
| Forestry                  | 11,656 |
| Construction              | 47,468 |
| Transport                 | 46,273 |
| Government Service        | 43,307 |
| Coal Mining               | 7,395  |
| Metal Mining              | 60,573 |

At the end of 1954 there were 177 trade unions with a registered membership of 165,000. Seven unions had memberships in excess of 5,000, aggregating 88,000; the largest union was the Nigerian Union of Teachers with 31,000 members.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are yams, cassava, guinea corn and millet, cocoyams, groundnuts, oil palms, maize, cocoa, rice and cotton.

The cattle population is in the region of 6,000,000.

Timber products are of three categories: logs, sawn timber and plywood, of which the first is the most important. In 1954 10·3 million cubic feet of logs and 1·3 million cubic feet of sawn timber were exported.

Despite extensive fishing in inland and coastal waters, the supply of fish does not meet the demand. At sea, improved methods of fishing by canoe and motor boat are being developed. The Nigerian Shipping and Trading Company are operating two large trawlers. Inland reservoirs are being stocked and village fishing ponds started.

The chief minerals are tin and columbite, all of which is exported, and coal, which is used almost entirely by the railway. In 1954 tin concentrates production amounted to 10,933 tons and columbite 2,914 tons; 636,000 tons of coal were produced. Small quantities of lead, zinc and gold are also produced.

Apart from hand methods of expressing groundnut and palm oil, there are 57 palm oil mills operated mainly by Regional Production Development Boards; five groundnut oil mills, three of which are privately owned; three soap factories at Apapa, Aba and Kano; a cigarette factory at Ibadan; a brewery at Lagos; several small plants producing fruit juices, minerals and soda water; a cannery; an up-to-date plywood and veneer factory at Sapele, several small sawmills elsewhere; two 50-loom weaving mills, one near Lagos, the other at Kano; some light engineering works; tyre re-treading plants; a ceramic factory; and several rice mills, some being Government-operated.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Four independent Regional Marketing Boards handle the five main export crops—cocoa, palm kernels and palm oil, groundnuts and cotton. They ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, spend money on research and finance schemes for the economic benefit of the people in the producing areas. The Government and the Marketing Boards have a common policy of developing co-operative organizations. Its success is indicated by the fact that the tonnage of cocoa marketed by the Association of Nigerian Co-operative Exporters represented over 10% of the total Nigerian cocoa crop.

There is an active co-operative movement in the country, principally organized for the benefit of agricultural co-operators and thrift societies. There are Government Departments in the Regions and in Lagos engaged exclusively in providing assistance to these societies.
