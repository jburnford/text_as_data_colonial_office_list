MONTSERRAT

Area and Geographical Features

The area of the island is about 32 square miles. It is entirely volcanic, very mountainous and comprises three main hill masses—Silver Hill in the north (1,285 feet), Central Hills (2,450 feet) and Soufriere Hills (Chance Peak 3,002 feet) in the south. Forest and woodland cover about 10 square miles in the two main ranges and streams are plentiful. The northern hills, however, are almost without trees and in that part of the island there is little cultivation.

Principal Town

Plymouth, the only town, has a population of about 2,500.

History

The island was colonized in 1632 when a number of Irishmen of Warner's company made their homes there. It was captured by the French in 1667, restored to England at the Peace of Breda later in the same year, but capitulated to the French again in 1782, and was finally ceded to Britain in 1783.

Constitution

The present constitution is defined by Ordinance No. 1 of 1952 which enlarges the elective element in the Legislative Council and creates four electoral districts in place of a single one. The Council is now composed of the Commissioner as President, two official members, two nominated members and five elected members. One of the elected members is also Deputy President of the Council. The Executive Council comprises one ex officio member (if the Governor is present), two official members and three unofficial members.

Land Policy

Crown land comprises the Government Land Settlement, where occupation is confined to an annual lease, and a small area acquired for public purposes. All other land is privately owned.

Taxation

The following forms of direct taxation are in force:

Income Tax (ranging from 6d.—13s. 6d. per £ of chargeable income; companies 5s. 6d. per £ of chargeable income).
Land and House Tax.
Motor Vehicles Tax.
Bicycles Tax.
General Taxes.

The other main forms of taxation are import and export and excise duties.

Development Plans

Montserrat received an allocation of £124,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. This plan was revised at the end of 1951 and grants from the Imperial Treasury now bring the total allocation to £188,000. For the period 1955-60 a further allocation of £180,000 has been made. Schemes approved during 1955 include the construction of an airfield and a secondary senior school in Plymouth.

Other Development

A private company, the Montserrat Company Limited, is working side by side with Government in the development of a livestock industry. An electric light and power plant for Plymouth came into operation in 1955.

Education

Primary education and secondary education are both in the main Government-controlled. There are 12 Government elementary schools, one aided denominational school, and one elementary private school. There is one Government secondary school, and a preparatory private school for children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. At the end of 1954, of an estimated school population of 3,900, 3,365 children were enrolled in primary schools, with an average attendance of 3,025 (90%). The enrolment of the secondary school at the end of the same period was 129.

During the year 1954 there were four students from the Presidency pursuing professional courses abroad under the Leeward Islands Scholarship award, three of them in the United Kingdom, and one in Jamaica. Four primary school teachers were in training colleges.
Government expenditure on the Education Department in 1954 was $128,425 compared with $14,000 in 1935.

Library

The Montserrat Public Library has a membership of over 750 adults and juveniles and comprises adult, juvenile and reference sections with a total book stock of about 4,000 volumes.

Health

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1954 was $117,462, compared with $15,816 in 1935. There were 55 available beds at the Glendon Hospital. In-patients at the hospital totalled 1,100, out-patients (first attendances) 6,758. There were three health centres and four out-posts at which ante-natal and infant welfare clinics were held.

Communications

The island's road system consists of three main public roads, total mileage 40 miles; and about 30 miles of secondary unsurfaced roads.

An airfield is under consideration.

The Alcoa and the Harrison Steamship Companies' steamers call when freight offers. The island is linked with other islands of the Colony, and with Dominica and Barbados, by two motor launches which maintain a regular service between all the islands.

Broadcasting

The local broadcasting service has semi-official status. The transmitter (40w., wavelength 92 metres, frequency 3·255 M/cs.) and the studio are located at Olveston.

Principal Occupations

In 1946, the total population gainfully employed was found to be 6,617, 59·68% of them in agriculture. There is one trade union in the island which claimed a membership of 350 at the end of 1954.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, limes, sugar-cane and sweet potatoes.

ST. CHRISTOPHER, NEVIS and ANGUILLA

Area and Geographical Features

The total area of the Presidency is 153 square miles (St. Kitts 68, Nevis 50 and Anguilla 35 square miles). St. Kitts has a range of lofty mountains traversing its central part (Mount Misery 3,711 feet). Nevis is nearly circular in form with a central mountain rising to 3,596 feet. Both islands are of volcanic origin. Anguilla is flat and composed of oligocene limestone and clay. Hot mineral springs with valuable medicinal properties are to be found near Charlestown, Nevis.

The Principal Towns are Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts, with a population of 13,500, and Charlestown, the capital of Nevis, population 3,600.

History

St. Kitts was colonized by Sir Thomas Warner in 1623. For more than a century it changed hands with the French as a result of constant warfare, but was finally restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, as was Nevis (which was colonized in 1628) and both have remained British possessions since that date. Anguilla has remained a British possession since its colonization in 1650.

Constitution

The Executive Council for the Presidency consists of the Governor, the Administrator, two official members, and up to six unofficial members, of whom one represents Nevis.

Under an Ordinance of 1952 the Legislative Council comprises the Administrator (President), two ex officio members, eight elected members and three nominated members. An elected majority in the Legislative Council is thus provided for.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot own land except under licence from the Governor.

Taxation

The main taxes in force are Customs duty and income tax. Income tax rates range from 6d. in the £ to 15s. in the £ upon the chargeable income of an individual. Companies pay a flat rate of 8s. in the £. Other taxes are house, land and trade tax.

BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS

Area

The total area of the Presidency is 67 square miles. Excluding numerous small rocks, the islands number 36, of which 11 are inhabited. The largest are Tortola (20 square miles), Virgin Gorda (13 square miles), Anegada (11 square miles) and Jost van Dyke (7 square miles).

Principal Town

Road Town, Tortola (population 1,100), is the seat of the Presidential Administration.

Geographical Features

The Islands, except for Anegada, represent a projection of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands archipelago. Anegada, a flat coral feature of more recent geological formation, is the northern outpost of the group in the Atlantic, and is surrounded by dangerous reefs. Virgin Gorda and Tortola rise abruptly like the tops of submerged mountains from a submarine plateau of 20-30 fathoms of water. The highest elevation is 1,780 feet on Sage Mountain, Tortola, where the remnants of an interesting xerophytic rain forest still exist.

History

In 1648 a party of Dutch buccaneers are said to have set up their abode at Soper’s Hole, Tortola, but were driven out by a party of English adventurers in 1666. In 1672 Colonel Stapleton, Governor of the Leeward Islands, took Tortola from the Dutch, who were then in possession. It was not, however, until 1680, according to Suckling, that the islands were permanently settled by English planters from Anguilla; they have been uninterruptedly British since then. In 1773 the Settlers were granted a charter and the first House of Assembly was convened the following year.

Constitution

The Commissioner, who is the chief executive, administers the Government under the Governor of the Leeward Islands. The Commissioner is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of himself as the ex officio member (when the Governor is present) and two official and three unofficial Members. The Virgin Islands Constitution Act, 1950, under which the legislature was constituted, was replaced by the Virgin Islands Constitution and Elections Ordinance, 1954, which provides for a Legislative Council with an elected majority elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The Legislative Council consists of the Commissioner as President, two nominated official members, two nominated non-official members and six elected members. The Council elects at its first meeting a Deputy President who presides in the absence of the Commissioner.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot hold land except under licence from the Governor.

The total area of Crown lands is estimated at 18,000 acres. Most of it is situated in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. In Anegada, where the soil is poor, the occupants of Crown lands are allowed the use of those lands free of charge but rentals are collected from occupants of Crown lands elsewhere, where there is good soil fertility. Arrangements exist for the sale of Crown lands to occupants in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. Non-natives own approximately 2,626 acres of the total land area of the Presidency. The prevailing type of tenure for all holdings is fee simple.

Taxation

Taxes consist mainly of Customs duties and land, house, road, animal, boat and income taxes. Import duties average 12% ad valorem at general rates and 8% ad valorem at preferential rates. Export duties are fixed at specific rates which average less than 5% at current market values.

The income tax rate upon the chargeable income of every person other than a company, ranges from 6d. to 13s. 6d. in the £. Companies pay a flat rate of 5s. 6d. in every £.

Development Plans

The Presidency has been granted allocations totalling £106,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 and a further allocation of £100,000 for the period 1955-60. Expenditure on schemes up to 1952 was undertaken mainly on school buildings, agricultural and livestock development, water supplies and health projects. Since 1953 a road construction programme has been in progress; additional staff has been recruited for the Public Works Department to carry out the programme, and road-making machinery and plant have been purchased. Schemes have also been approved for the installation of radiotelephones and for a piped water supply for Road Town.
Education

There is one secondary and post-primary, and one primary school, maintained by Government; 11 denominational schools, which receive grants from Government funds; and four private schools. In 1954, there were 961 male and 1,038 female pupils enrolled at all schools. Attendance was approximately 85·6% of enrolment.

The cost of primary education, except the provision and maintenance of denominational school buildings, is met from Government funds and in 1954 the sum of $58,447 was so expended, compared with $3,446 in 1938.

Libraries

There is a Library in Road Town, said to be one of the best of the small libraries in the British Caribbean. There are library deposit services in the out islands. In 1954 the Library had a total of 9,743 books and 1,088 registered borrowers.

Health

The Tortola Cottage Hospital has 30 beds, and a total of 335 out-patients received treatment during 1954. There were 555 in-patients. The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1954 was $42,673 compared with $2,592 in 1938.

Communications

Launches maintain a mail and passenger service with St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, whence air, sea and cable communications exist to all parts of the world. Through-bookings can be obtained at St. Thomas to almost any destination in Europe or the western hemisphere.

There is no broadcasting service in the Presidency.

The Principal Occupation is stock-raising. Others are fishing, and the production of food crops and charcoal.

The Main Food Crops are vegetables and fruit.

The estimated livestock population is:—cattle 4,519, sheep 1,130, goats 4,443, swine 1,160. The fishing industry is unorganized.
