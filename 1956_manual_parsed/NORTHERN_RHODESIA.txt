Population
The population at the census of 8th May, 1951, and estimated population at 31st December, 1954, were as follows:

|                | 1951   | 1954   |

Geographical Features
With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000–5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 703 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate
There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°–100°, but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.
### History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. Lacerda, who visited Chief Kasembe's capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in June 1798. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty's Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be, and on 17th October, 1900, the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika's dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy of £850.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed, and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company, but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company's administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company, and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April, 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

### Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 161). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council of nine, five officials and four unofficials, presided over by the Governor. Each unofficial member is responsible for a group of Departments. The Legislative Council consists of twenty-six members, of whom eight are official, twelve are elected Europeans, two are Europeans nominated by the Governor to represent African interests, and four are Africans, nominated by the Governor (who usually nominates those selected by the African Representative Council from among its own members). It is presided over by the Speaker, who is an unofficial but not a member of the Legislative Council.

### Land Policy

Land is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land is alienated on leasehold tenure by the Land Board which insists on certain standards of finance and farming skill. There is in certain areas freehold land held by private persons who obtained title in the early days; and a proposal is now in hand for the grant of freehold tenure on certain conditions to the holders of long leases.

### Taxation

The Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of Income Tax and Customs and Excise Duties on the 1st April, 1954.

Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 6s. and 17s. 6d. per annum. There are, in addition,

Public Finance

The establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the 23rd October 1953 resulted in considerable changes in the Territory's financial responsibilities and arrangements. To conform with the Federal Government's financial year, which runs from the 1st July to the 30th June, the Territory's accounts were not closed on the 31st December 1953, the financial period being extended to the 30th June 1954.

The Territory retained its full revenue and met its full recurrent expenditure up to the 31st December 1953. For the six months period ended the 30th June 1954, revenue to which the Federal Government had become entitled was collected on behalf of that Government and paid over, except that the Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of Income Tax and Customs and Excise Duties on the 1st April 1954. With effect from the 1st January 1954 the Federal Government assumed full financial responsibility for the Departments which it was due to take over, and refunded to the Northern Rhodesia Government the full cost of administering them. The figures in the following table relating to the first six months of 1954 are not, therefore, comparable with those in preceding years, as both revenue and expenditure totals include figures resulting from the settlements between the two Governments. The principal Departments and services taken over by the Federal Government in 1954 were as follows:

Audit
Civil Aviation
Military
Prisons
Customs
Income Tax
Posts and Telegraphs
European Education
Health.

The main sources of revenue are now the payment received from the Federal Government representing 17% of the collections within the Federation on account of taxes on income, and the Territorial surcharge on Company Income Tax assessments also collected by the Federal Government on behalf of the Northern Rhodesia Government. These two taxes represent 58% of the estimated revenue for 1954-55, and a further 13% is derived from mineral royalties. The Northern Rhodesian Government no longer collects Customs and Excise duties. These are levied by the Federal Government, and not shared with the other Territories of the Federation.

Expenditure included the following appropriations:

Currency

The currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The present denominations are 10s., £1, £5 and £10 notes, cupro-nickel or copper threepenny pieces, pennies and cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns. Under the Federal Government's Coinage and Currency Act, 1954, the Central African Currency Board was set up; the first federal currency issued in November, 1955, but Southern Rhodesia currency continues also as legal tender for the present. As from 1st January, 1955, British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Development Plans

The Northern Rhodesia Territorial Government's Development Plan is now estimated to cost £39,648,890 in the period up to 30th June, 1957, omitting the Federal subjects previously included.

The above sum is derived as follows:

| Loans | £8,879,000 |
| Colonial Development and Welfare Grant | £2,778,000 |
| Northern Rhodesia Development Account | £27,991,890 |

Total: £39,648,890

The plan is allocated to the following subjects:

| Loans, Public Utilities | £2,502,000 |
| Social Services | £1,875,625 |
| Economic Services | £2,911,352 |
| African Rural Development | £1,060,000 |
| Water Development | £1,480,402 |
| Public Works, including African Housing | £19,075,337 |
| Roads and Bridges | £3,244,942 |
| Law and Order | £1,049,850 |
| Loans to Local Authorities and Co-operatives | £5,620,000 |
| Miscellaneous | £829,382 |

Total: £39,648,890

Education

Non-African Education and all Higher Education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

In 1954 there were 34 European Government Schools, 2 Government-aided and 8 private schools providing education for European children. Nine of the Government schools provided education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard. There were 6 Government hostels boarding 387 children.

The enrolment in Government schools was 8,861; in Government-aided and private schools, 1,883. Technical training was given in conjunction with correspondence courses. Government assistance in the form of scholarships, bursaries and loans is given to those who proceed to higher education centres outside Northern Rhodesia. There were 133 students in receipt of such assistance in 1955.

There are 8 Government schools for Asiatics and Coloureds which cater for 603 children; one of the schools is for Coloureds and has a hostel for 82 boarders. Financial assistance is given to those who cannot attend the Coloured school to enable them to be educated outside the Territory. Similar assistance is given to Indian children who cannot attend day schools.

Of the 360,000 African children of school age some 188,318 were in the following schools in 1954:

| No. of schools | No. of pupils, etc. |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools | 1,258 | 176,285 |
| Unaided primary schools | 116 | 8,745 |
| Secondary schools | 8 | 722 |
| Teacher training schools | 19 | 966 |
| Trades schools | 19 | 1,172 |
| Other vocational schools (girls) | 15 | 428 |

The only post-secondary course within the Territory is for the training of teachers in upper primary schools. Bursaries are awarded for students to attend various higher courses outside the Territory: 47 such bursaries were awarded in 1954 and 14 of these bursars commenced their studies in 1955. A comparison of recurrent expenditure is made below.

| Year | African Education | European Education |

| 1938 | £32,740          | £38,786            |
| 1945 | £149,450         | £75,289            |
| 1953 | £642,834         | £523,100           |
| 1954 | £853,822         |                    |
Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.

The Institute, with headquarters at Lusaka, has conducted social research in British Central Africa since 1938. Emphasis is placed on the study of the reaction of African peoples to modern social and economic conditions.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia's National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

Public health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

There are eight Government European Hospitals in the Territory and it is hoped that another one (Mazabuka) will be open in 1956. During 1954 patients admitted totalled 8,349. Outpatient figures are not available. The principal causes of admission in order of priority were diseases of the respiratory system, diseases of the digestive system, malaria (including undefined cases), violence (including all accidents) and other infectious and parasitic diseases. Confinements numbered 1,079.

Of the 50,630 admissions to the fourteen African hospitals operated by the Government, 7,965 were on account of infectious and parasitic diseases (excluding malaria). The other main causes of admission were diseases of the respiratory system, malaria (including undefined malaria), violence (including all accidents), diseases of the digestive system and diseases of the eye, in that order.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above there are 110 Rural Health Centres. In 1954 these cared for 18,764 in-patients together with 892,260 out-patients who attended on 3,186,593 occasions.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and certain other aspects of communications.

There is an international airport at Livingstone and national airports at Lusaka, Ndola and Kasama, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. There are 42 other airfields, 19 of which are all-weather. Internal services are operated by Central African Airways. External services are operated by B.O.A.C. and Springbok Airways.

Other external charter services are operated by Hunting and Airwork Air Charter.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo border (near Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 642 miles.

The total mileage of maintained roads in the Territory is now 19,124, made up as follows:

| Roads Type          | Miles |
|---------------------|-------|
| Main roads          | 4,350 |
| District and Branch roads | 4,569 |
| Ungazetted tracks   | 6,535 |
| Town roads          | 131   |
| Rural roads         | 3,339 |

There are 442 miles of main roads of Class 1 (bituminous surface) standard. This total includes roads maintained by the Public Works Department, main roads through townships, and also roads completed but still maintained by contractors.

The Zambezi River Transport Service Board of Control operates a transport service along the Zambezi River from Livingstone to Mongu. The first portion of the route is covered by rail, and the remainder by road. In 1954 the service carried 2,963 short tons and 13,126 passengers.

Broadcasting

The Central African Broadcasting Station is situated in Lusaka and broadcasts for nine hours on weekdays to the Africans of the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland. On Sundays, of the eight hours during which the station broadcasts, four hours are devoted to programmes for European listeners, and the remaining four hours' programmes are in English for advanced African listeners. Programmes in English and eight vernaculars are radiated on two transmitters, of 15 kW. and 2½ kW. A licence fee of 20s. is charged to listeners in Southern Rhodesia and licences are issued free of charge in Nyasaland. Licences are not required in Northern Rhodesia. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 Africans in the three territories own wireless sets and that at peak listening hours there is a potential listening public of over a quarter of a million. A wired broadcast service, under the control of the Central African Broadcasting Station, has been installed in one of the locations in Lusaka.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize and tobacco. Small quantities of groundnuts, rice, cotton and wheat are also produced.

The approximate livestock population is cattle 985,000, sheep and goats 115,000, and pigs 43,000. During 1954 some 55,000 head of cattle were slaughtered.

Output of sawlogs, poles, and firewood amounted to 1,550,604 tons in 1954.

The chief minerals are copper, zinc, lead, and cobalt. Also produced are limestone, tin, manganese, silver and gold. Total mineral production in 1954 was valued at nearly £98 million.

A very large variety of products is now being manufactured in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, steel finishing work, tiles, furniture, clothing, beer, mineral waters, soap and oils, metal castings and nuts and bolts.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru, and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is cured and marketed in the urban areas.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of imports and exports.

For 1954 onwards no separate figures for Northern Rhodesia are available; totals of imports, exports and production are now included in the Federal figures.

| Year | Imports (£'000) | Exports (£'000) |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 5,168          | 10,131         |

| 1953 | 51,833         | 94,833         |

In 1942 23·4% of imports came from the United Kingdom, 32% from South Africa, 20·1% from Southern Rhodesia and 16% from foreign countries. In 1953 the corresponding figures were 36·5%, 29·1%, 14·8% and 12%.

In 1942 72·5% of the exports went to the United Kingdom, 8·9% to South Africa, 1·7% to Southern Rhodesia, and 5·1% to foreign countries. In 1953 the corresponding figures were 61%, 3·9%, 2% and 31·2%.

The chief imports by value in 1953 were foodstuffs, textiles and fibres, metals and manufactures, motor vehicles, oils and paints, and timbers.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

The Co-operative movement is well established and thriving. For the year ended 31st December, 1954, societies had a combined turnover of £4,139,594, a paid-up share capital of £355,480, and a membership of 18,340.

Societies totalled 133, of which 114 were of primarily African membership. The co-operative movement amongst both Europeans and Africans is strongest in the agricultural producer field, although a small thriving group of consumer societies with mainly European membership operates on the Copperbelt.
