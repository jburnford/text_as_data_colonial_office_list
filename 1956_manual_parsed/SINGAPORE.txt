SINGAPORE

Area

The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islands, is 224·5 square miles. The City of Singapore covers an area of 31·5 square miles.

The area of Christmas Island is 62 square miles.

The Cocos-Keeling Islands, a group of 27 small coral islands with an area of five square miles, were transferred from the Colony of Singapore to Australia, with effect from 23rd November, 1955.

Population

The estimated population at 1st July, 1955, was:

|                | Singapore | Christmas Island |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Chinese        | 926,453   | 1,528            |
| Malaysians     | 148,102   | 418              |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 94,290 | 5               |
| Europeans      | 18,202    | 103              |
| Eurasians      | 11,684    | —                |
| Others         | 11,803    | —                |
| Total          | 1,210,534 | 2,054            |

The population of Singapore City, the seat of Government, is about 862,222.
Geographical Features

The highest point on Singapore Island is 581 feet above sea level. The largest permanent stream is the Sungei Seletar which is nine miles long. Forest and Nature Reserves, including mangrove swamps, total about 15 square miles.

The greater part of Christmas Island is a central plateau 600-700 feet above sea level, rising to low hills up to 1,170 feet. Most of the island is densely wooded; it contains extensive deposits of mixed phosphates. The island lies about 190 nautical miles south of the western extremity of Java.

Climate of Singapore

There are no well-defined dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The mean maximum temperature is 87°, the mean minimum 74°; average annual rainfall is 95 inches.

History

A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme, and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits: it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the Imperial Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was recovered on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, and was constituted a separate Colony.

Despite the despoliation it suffered during the occupation, and the post-war unrest which culminated in 1948 in the Malayan Emergency, Singapore entered a new phase of prosperity which was accentuated by the increased world demand for rubber. In 1951 imports were valued at $3,625,000,000 and exports at $4,095,000,000.

The Malayan Emergency has had its inevitable effect on Singapore, particularly in 1950 when there were many terrorist outrages. In December 1950 occurred the tragic riots arising from the "Bertha Hertogh" case, in which 18 people were killed. Public security has improved steadily since 1951, but the Communist threat by infiltration of Trade Unions and Chinese schools has grown. In 1955 the essential security powers of the Emergency Regulations were carried forward, with substantial improvement, into legislation to last for a period of three years.

Constitution

The Crown Colony of Singapore became a separate unit of Government by Order in Council of 27th March, 1946. On 8th February, 1955, under the Singapore Colony Order in Council 1955 a new constitution giving a large measure of internal self-government came into force. It provides for a Legislative Assembly of 32 members, presided over by a Speaker. There are 25 members elected from 25 one-member constituencies. The electorate of 300,000 consists of resident citizens of the United Kingdom and the Colonies (and those born in the Federation of Malaya) over 21 years of age. The remaining seven members are the three ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary) and four members nominated by the Governor. The Government consists of a Council of Ministers collectively responsible to the Assembly and individually responsible for the administration of a Department or group of departments. It consists of seven unofficial members, including the Chief Minister, of which six must be elected members of the Assembly; and the three ex officio members of the Assembly. The Governor presides over the Council, and is responsible for defence, foreign affairs and internal security, and has certain emergency reserve powers. The first elections were held on April 2nd and as a result there was established a Coalition Labour Front-UMNO-MCA* Government under Mr. David

* United Malays National Organization/Malayan Chinese Association.
Marshall. The municipal area is administered by a two-thirds elected City Council of 27 members. The Royal Charter giving the dignity of a City was presented on September 22nd, 1951.

The present City Council and Rural Board will be replaced by a City and Island Council of a Mayor, eight aldermen and 24 elected Councillors.

Land Policy

From the foundation of the Settlement of Singapore there has never been any restriction on the alienation of land to non-natives. Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant Crown land within the City area is practically exhausted and large areas are in process of acquisition for public purposes, particularly housing.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the Colony or received in the Colony from outside. Companies are chargeable at 30% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 3% on the first $500 of chargeable income and rising to 30% on incomes exceeding $50,000. Non-resident individuals are charged from 20% to 30%, but British subjects and British protected persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. A double taxation arrangement with the United Kingdom is in force.

Public Finance

| Year       | Revenue     | Expenditure |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1946 (9 months) | 29,498,716 | 24,352,910 |
| 1947       | 77,967,858  | 51,824,007  |
| 1950       | 114,016,040 | 97,117,474  |
| 1951       | 175,295,833 | 127,397,183 |
| 1952       | 210,561,686 | 167,754,073 |
| 1953       | 238,518,829 | 169,730,549 |
| 1954       | 207,297,524 | 248,919,571 |

In 1954, 33.90% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 37.72% from income and other taxes.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Administration—general 8.32%
- Social Services 20.89%
- Judicial, Police and Prisons 11.21%
- Miscellaneous Services 28.98%

The Public Debt of the Colony of Singapore at the 31st December 1954 amounted to $115 million or approximately $95.0 per head of the population. The Public Debt comprises:

- S.S. 3% Loan, 1962–72: $30 million
- S.S. 3% War Loan, 1952–59: $25 million
- S.S. 3% War Loan, 1953–60: $10 million
- Singapore 3% Rehabilitation Loan, 1962–70: $50 million

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is the only legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
(a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners;
(b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.
(c) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of 5 cent denomination.
(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.
(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.
(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. Currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July 1941 were demonetized on 31st August, 1948.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December, 1952, and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation as at 31st December, 1954, was $21,961,660.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1954, was $778,958,620 and coins (other than silver) $26,586,510.

Development Plans

Thirty-two separate projects of the original Singapore Development Plan are being actively pursued at present. The eventual expenditure on these projects was expected to be approximately £100,000,000 over a ten-year period ending in 1960. The group nature of these projects is set out in the table below.

| Per cent. | £000   | £000   |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Agriculture | 450    | 3,857  |
| Transport/Communications | 10,103 | 86,597 |
| Fuel/Power | 16,517 | 141,574 |
| Multi-Purpose | 5,600 | 48,000 |
| Social Capital | 67,000 | 574,286 |
| Research | 330    | 2,829  |

Out of this total just over £48,000,000 is estimated to have been spent by the end of 1954.

Of the amount earmarked for multi-purpose schemes, much the largest part was for two extensive development-cum-reclamation schemes. Expenditure on these has been postponed indefinitely.

Development plans have now been revised and some adjustments made. Planning is at present proceeding on the basis of about £450,000,000 being required in the period 1956–59. This includes £170,000,000 required by the Government to be spent on educational buildings, medical buildings, roads, and bridges, completion of the International Airport, etc.; £120,000,000 required by the City Council (waterworks £25,000,000, electricity £40,000,000, sewerage £28,000,000 and gas £2,500,000); more than £100,000,000 for the Singapore Improvement Trust, to be used for development of estates and building housing accommodation, particularly low rental flats;
about $40,000,000 for the Harbour Board to complete the East Lagoon scheme to provide an additional nine deep water berths; and up to $20,000,000 or so which will be required for the Singapore Telephone Board and others.

Separate Development Estimates were produced for the first time in 1955. They are financed from the Development Fund which was established in 1953 with an appropriation from the revenue balances of $50,000,000 and which has been augmented in 1955 by a $20,000,000 appropriation from revenue.

During recent years the Colony has been helped considerably by financial assistance from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, including—

Paya Lebar Airport (total cost $46,000,000) 10,000,000
Urban Health Centre 1,500,000
New Queen's Dock 1,750,000

Singapore has not, however, qualified for a new territorial allocation and it follows from this, and from the increasing recurrent expenditure, that capital development in future must largely depend on the amount of money that can be borrowed locally or from overseas.

Education

The education system of the Colony provides education for some 178,000 pupils in 563 regular schools. The University of Malaya has 827 men and 216 women students of whom 645 are from outside the Colony. The Teachers' Training College provides courses for 960 men and 728 women students, the majority of these being on part-time courses while working as Teachers-in-Training in Primary Schools. There are 350 students in Junior Technical Schools. In addition 1,350 students attend Government Evening Classes in Commercial and Technical subjects, and there are 11,300 students enrolled in Adult Classes aided by Government. Of the pupils in regular schools, 84,000 are taught in English, 81,000 in Chinese, and 12,000 in the Vernacular Languages (Malay and Tamil). There are 6,300 teachers employed, 46% of them being trained. Of the school pupils, approximately 14% are in secondary classes. The Singapore Education Committee advises Government on all aspects of education and the Education Finance Board scrutinizes and approves the Department Estimates before their submission to Government.

The net cost of education in 1954 was $28·4 millions (capital expenditure $3·95 millions). The comparative figures for 1947 of $3·38 millions (capital expenditure $0·22 millions) indicate the vast increase in cost due to the implementation of the Colony's Development Programme in education.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Raffles Library contains about 80,000 volumes, including a large collection of books on Malaya. There are three part-time branches. Books for children are provided at each library, and there is a separate children's library at the Main Library. Although small membership subscriptions are payable the library is financed mainly by the Colony Government. It also serves as a national library in that it contains the Colony's archives and the books and other publications which are printed in Singapore and deposited under the terms of the Printers and Publishers Ordinance.

The Raffles Museum has departments of zoology, ethnography and archaeology of the Malaysian region, and of the history of Singapore and Malaya. It publishes the Bulletin of the Raffles Museum.

The Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, closely associated with the Raffles Museum, publishes a quarterly journal devoted mainly to history, archaeology and ethnography.

Health

The Government Medical Department provides some 5,000 beds in its eight hospitals and Leper Settlement of which some 1,500 are available for the treatment of acute disease. There are eight static dispensaries, four travelling dispensaries and a floating dispensary service for general cases among the population of over 310,000 in the rural areas, and a chain of 46 centres where the Government maternity and child welfare division operates in addition. A school medical and dental service and a quarantine service are working on a steadily expanding basis.

A ten-year Medical Plan is in operation to double all the existing services and provide adequate service for the whole population by 1960, and a well-appointed Nurses' Home, for 250 nurses, a new outpatients' division, with a modern blood-transfusion unit at the Civil General Hospital of 800 beds, and four rural health centres were completed and opened in 1954. Work on improvements and extensions to the Maternity Hospital covering both accommodation and teaching facilities is nearing completion. Under the Plan the Tuberculosis Hospital will be built up to 1,700 beds from the present 500 beds. The Veneral Diseases campaign is conducted on most up-to-date lines with a special hospital, clinics, a travelling dispensary and a follow-up visiting scheme.

In the field of tuberculosis, out-door treatment is provided at a clinic and domiciliary relief and assistance by the Almoners' Department is rapidly expanding; a B.C.G. campaign was successfully started in 1951. Some 19,000 cases of tuberculosis have passed through this centre since 1946 and the number of out-patients in regular attendance is over 8,000. This problem remains one of the most urgent, however, and plans for more beds and a Chest Unit are in hand. The Royal Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association with its own clinic and treatment centre gives most valuable co-operation to the Government. This Association is also greatly extending the scope of its service, particularly in rehabilitation. The Tuberculosis Treatment Allowance Scheme is operated by the Department of Social Welfare. The payment under this scheme is restricted to patients whose prognosis is good and who are likely to be returned to their former working capacity within a reasonable space of time.

Main hospital out-patient attendances, which were under 100,000 per annum before the war, have risen to over 1,100,000; yearly attendances at rural and maternity clinics have risen from 85,000 to 185,000. Homes visited by nurses now total 80,826 and by midwives 65,518. An attempt is made to see all rural births, while the Maternity Hospital deals with some 22,700 maternity cases yearly or over 40% of the total births of the Colony. In-patients in the main acute hospitals total over 60,000 per annum, compared with 26,000 before the war. Leprosy services are being rapidly modernized and some 1,500 patients are under treatment or observation.
There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualifications of M.B. and B.S., registrable in the United Kingdom, can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery), also registrable in the United Kingdom, the Diploma of Pharmacy and the Diploma of the Royal Sanitary Institute. A complete course for nurses is in operation and the local qualification is now registrable in England and Wales. The Diploma in Public Health granted by the University is recognized by the General Medical Council.

Statutory Boards cover all medical, nursing, dental and pharmacy activities, and there is a Hospitals Board.

Health figures for the Colony continue to improve. Although the population is increasing by some 40,000 a year through natural means the death rate decreased from 19·51 in 1939 to 9·26 in 1954. The infantile death rate fell from 130·4 per thousand in 1939 to 56·10 in 1954. With no outbreak of any of the major infectious diseases, Singapore remains one of the healthiest city ports in the Far East. The birth rate at 48·86 continues to be one of the highest in the world. This has resulted in a very young population with its special and peculiar problems.

All the usual special Departments such as eye, ear, nose and throat and orthopaedics, are included in the hospital services. Physiotherapists, almoners, health visitors and occupational therapists are employed on an expanding scale. Treatment of mental disease is based on one of the largest institutions in the East and here all the modern forms of treatment can be obtained.

The Government expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1954 amounted to $22·9 million compared with $6·3 million in 1947.

Communications

Air—The new Singapore Airport, an international airport, was opened to traffic on the 21st August, 1955. The new airport has a runway of 8,000 feet in length, which can be extended to meet any aviation requirement capable of being foreseen at present. The Regional Air Traffic Control Centre based in Singapore Airport controls all traffic within the confines of its 750,000 square miles Flight Information Region.

Major external international passenger, airmail and cargo services operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways: Sydney–London, Sydney–Singapore
- British Overseas Airways Corporation: London–Sydney, London–Tokyo, Hong Kong–Singapore, London–Singapore Freighter Service
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines: Amsterdam–Djakarta
- Pan American Airways: San Francisco–Singapore
- Cathay Pacific Airways: Hong Kong–Singapore
- Thai Airways: Bangkok–Singapore
- Garuda Indonesian Airways: Djakarta–Bangkok, Medan–Singapore, Djakarta–Palembang–Singapore
- Air-India International Union of Burma Airways: Bombay–Singapore, Rangoon–Singapore

Road—The Public Works Department maintains 239·98 miles of bituminous roads in the City and Rural areas. The City Engineer maintains 181 miles of roads in the City area.

Rail—The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge. The Railway enters the Colony at the Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour. There are four railway stations in the Island of Singapore.

Water—The control of the port of Singapore is divided between (a) a government and (b) a non-government authority.

(a) The Master Attendant administers all the waters of the port including the Outer and Inner Roads, Keppel Harbour, the Western Anchorages, Telok Ayer Basin, the Singapore, Rochore, Kallang and Geylang rivers and other Colony waters.

(b) The Singapore Harbour Board administers the wharves, docks and premises of the Board situated in Keppel Harbour and a slipway at Tanjong Rhu under the provisions of the Ports Ordinance; also the quays and waterfront premises at Telok Ayer Basin, on behalf of the Singapore Government. With the exception of the Chairman (Manager) the members of the Board are appointed by the Governor.

The natural harbours around the southern end of the island still retain their deep water channel capable of taking the largest ships. Wharves comprise:

| Wharf          | Length | Water depth |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| West Wharf     | 4,525 ft. | 33 ft. and over |
| Empire Dock (24½ acres) | 3,522 ft. | 27 ft. and over |
| Main Wharf     | 3,152 ft. | 33 ft. and over |
| East Wharf     | 700 ft.  | 24 ft.      |
| Sheers Wharf   | 325 ft.  | 24 ft.      |

In 1954 cargo handled by the wharves totalled 4,593,790 tons. The number of vessels accommodated in 1954 was 4,112, net registered tonnage being 11,759,884 for vessels berthed alongside.

The Board maintains tugs for the towing, berthing and unberthing of ships; lighters, a fleet of steel barges and a salvage tug with a range of 5,000 miles.

The Board has first-class facilities for docking and ships' repairs with five dry docks operating. The largest of these is King's Dock, which can accommodate ships up to 45,000 tons, and construction has begun on a parallel Queen's Dock. There are also modern plating shops to carry out hull repairs. Electric current for lighting and power can be supplied to vessels alongside repair berths and in dry docks. Fresh water, steam, hydraulic power and compressed air are all available throughout the dockyards. A modern oxygen plant is also available for ship repair work.

The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, the U.S.A., and other countries in the Far East, and there is a regular freight and passenger service to South Africa via East African ports, and to South America. Several coasting lines are engaged in trade to Indonesia and in conveying transit cargo to Thailand, Borneo and Sarawak.

Broadcasting

Radio Malaya is operated on a pan-Malayan basis by the Department of Broadcasting for the Governments of Singapore and the Federation of
Malaya. Programmes in English, Chinese (seven dialects), Malay and Tamil are broadcast over three networks. The total number of hours of broadcasting is 240 per week, of which over 24 hours are occupied by broadcasts to Schools in English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil.

In Singapore the Department has studios and offices at Caldecott Hill. The main transmitting Station is at Jurong, some 14½ miles from the City, where four short wave transmitters of average power 5 kW. and three medium wave transmitters of average power 10 kW. are situated.

In the Federation of Malaya studios and offices are maintained at Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca. V.H.F. equipment has now been installed and these stations are fully integrated with the Singapore programmes.

The number of broadcast listening station licences in Singapore at the end of 1954 was 45,442.

A commercial company operates a rediffusion service in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Penang under Government licence, to which there were 33,744 subscribers in Singapore at 31st December, 1954.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief occupations are: transport and communications (including port and lighterage) 56,000, commerce and finance 100,000, light industries 80,000, agriculture (largely market gardening) 32,000, public administration (central Government, Defence Services and Local Authorities) 60,000. There are 226 registered trade unions, having a membership of 115,249.

Main Products

The small area of agricultural land is used mainly to produce food crops for local consumption. Poultry-rearing as a rural industry is thriving and 7 million head are kept. This is more than sufficient for local consumption and allows some to be exported. In addition the production of pigs is considerable (about 220,000) but other livestock are relatively few.

Manufactures comprise a wide range of light industries. The traditional concentration on processing of primary products such as rubber, tin, sago, rattan, and the provision of shipbuilding, docking and ship repairing facilities, light engineering works and motor assembly plants has been supplemented in recent years by a growing range of consumer goods such as dry cell batteries, glass products, edible oils, soap, perfumes, paper products, poultry food, paint, metal boxes, shoe polish, rope, biscuits and confectionery. A pencil factory will begin production shortly.

The huge long-term building programmes are also materially assisting construction industries such as brick and tile making, cement block manufacturing, sawmilling, metal window-frame works and makers of furniture and fixtures. Construction of a steel-rolling mill has just begun.

There is extensive fishing in local waters, but the catch is insufficient to meet the demand and is supplemented by imports. In consequence, Government is giving every encouragement to the development of offshore fisheries.

Trade

Singapore handles the major proportion of the imports and exports of the Federation of Malaya. In addition much of the external trade of her more immediate neighbours passes through her hands. The chief exports are rubber, tin, petroleum products, copra, canned pineapples, coconut oil and spices. A wide range of manufactured consumer and capital goods is also imported for local consumption and for re-export.

(See Federation of Malaya for statistics of pan-Malayan trade—page 137.)

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. The Pineapple Joint Industrial Council is concerned with the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruits, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.

Sixty-one co-operative societies were registered as at the 31st December, 1954. They had a membership of 26,289, a working capital of $7,598,288 and reserve funds of $231,998. They include 47 Thrift and Loan Societies, one Co-operative Union and a Housing Society.
