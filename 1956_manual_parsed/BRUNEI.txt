Geographical Features

Brunei has a coastline of about 100 miles, and is split into two and surrounded on the landward sides by Sarawak. In the west the valleys of the Belait and the Tutong rivers, representing more than half the area of the country, consist of extensive swamps gradually changing through a series of ridge and swamp formations into low hills at the sources of the rivers. The Labi hills in the extreme west cover an area of some 300 square miles and at no point exceed 1,300 feet in height. In the east the Brunei district is characterized by a number of steep rocky hills of no great height rising from alluvial flats, while Temburong, except near the coast, is hilly, becoming mountainous as one approaches Bukit Pagon, a spur from the main Bornean range.

Climate

There are no well-defined seasons, but the rainfall tends to be heaviest from October to the middle of January. The annual rainfall varies from 100 inches at the coast to over 200 inches in certain parts of the interior. The temperature rarely exceeds 90°; the usual daily range is between 76° and 86°.

History

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the sixteenth century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the whole of the island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some parts of the Philippines. Towards the end of the sixteenth century its power began to decline, the outlying territories...
gradually fell away, and by the beginning of the nineteenth century the kingdom of Brunei had dwindled so as to include only what is now Sarawak and part of North Borneo.

At this period the town itself seems to have degenerated to the condition of a slave market for the sale of captives of Illanun and Sulu pirates. Anarchy was rife in the outlying districts, and in 1841 Sarawak proper was ceded to Mr. (later Sir James) Brooke in return for his services in quelling an insurrection at Kuching, and he was declared Rajah of Sarawak. In 1846 the island of Labuan was ceded to Great Britain as a base for anti-piracy measures, and in 1877 the whole of the northern portion of Borneo was ceded to form the nucleus of what was to become British North Borneo. At various later dates further cessions were made to the Rajah of Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company till the territories of the State were eventually reduced to their present circumscribed limits.

In 1847 the Sultan entered into a Treaty with Great Britain for the furtherance of commercial relations and the mutual suppression of piracy. An additional clause provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction over British subjects in Brunei, which provision was modified by an Agreement of 1856. By a further Treaty made in 1888 Brunei was placed under the protection of Great Britain, and the Sultan agreed that the foreign relations of the State should be conducted by Her Majesty's Government. Provision was also made for the setting up of Consular Courts with jurisdiction over British subjects and foreign subjects enjoying British protection. In 1905-06 a supplementary Agreement was entered into whereby the Sultan undertook to accept a British officer, to be styled Resident, who should be the agent and representative of the British Government under the High Commissioner for the Malay States (at that time the Governor of the Straits Settlements). The Governor of Sarawak has been High Commissioner for Brunei since 1948.

**Constitution**

The supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan in Council. The State Council consists of eleven members, including the British Resident, with the Sultan as President. The assent of the Council is required for the enactment of legislation and important questions of policy are referred to it.

The general functions of administration are carried out by a British Resident under the supervision of the Governor of Sarawak as High Commissioner. By a Treaty of 1906 the Resident's advice must be asked and acted upon in all questions other than those affecting the Mohammadan religion. The seat of Government is in Brunei Town and there are Assistant Residents at Kuala Belait and at Headquarters.

**Land Policy**

In the State a transfer charge, lease or sub-lease of land to a person who is not a natural born subject of the Sultan, or who has not resided in the State for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than seven years during the ten years immediately preceding the date on which such instrument is delivered to the Land Officer, shall be subject to, and shall not be valid or registered without, the approval of the Sultan in Council.

**Taxation**

At present there is no Income Tax upon persons other than Companies. Companies are taxed at the rate of 30% upon their chargeable income. Import, export and excise duties are charged. A royalty is paid by the British Malayan Petroleum Company, based upon the amount of oil produced. A variety of licences are issued, mostly of a municipal nature.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | $1,179,979 | $1,476,725 |

**Currency**

The State is a party to the Malayan Currency Agreement and Malayan currency is the only legal tender.

The standard coin is the Malayan silver dollar with a par of 2s. 4d., at which it is linked to sterling. Subsidiary coins are those of value of 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents. There is also copper coin of 1 cent. Currency notes are issued in different denominations from 50 cents upwards.

**Development Plans**

A sum of $100,000,000 was set aside by the State Council in August 1954 for Development purposes. Expenditure on the plan in 1953 amounted to $1,006,099 and in 1954 to $7,279,959. Expenditure for 1955 is estimated at $13,908,855. By the end of 1955, the total sums earmarked were:

- Economic schemes and communications: $36,546,000
- Health, education and welfare: $32,634,000
- Administration and equipment: $4,658,500

On the economic side the main need of the State is for good road communications both to connect the capital with the large oilfield at Seria, and to open up new land for agricultural development; experiments are being conducted into the mechanical planning and harvesting of rice and loans are available from State funds on easy terms.

An old-age pensions scheme and pensions for dependants of the blind, lepers and lunatics was put into operation in 1955.

The most pressing need of the State is for schools and the plan provides for the construction of secondary boarding schools at Brunei for boys and girls and a mixed school at Seria. In addition, there will be five higher primary schools at the main centres and 26 rural primary schools. A system of free meals for rural schools and milk substitute for urban schools is in force.

Automatic telephone exchanges and V.H.F. radio telephones are in process of installation and the State water and electricity supplies are all being greatly increased.
A Medical Department plan provides for a modern hospital at Kuala Belait, which will also serve the needs of the Seria oilfield, and for a Tuberculosis Hospital and General Hospital in Brunei Town.

The re-building of devastated areas was completed in 1954.

**Education**

The number and types of institutions providing educational facilities are:

(a) 35 Malay Vernacular Schools, with a total enrolment of 3,175; 2,462 boys and 713 girls. These schools are fully maintained by Government. The Malay language is the medium of instruction; English is taught as a second language beginning in the Fourth Year.

(b) 7 Chinese Schools, with a total enrolment of 2,150; 1,275 boys and 875 girls. These schools are largely maintained by subscriptions from the Chinese communities in the areas in which the schools are situated, and by school fees. All receive grants-in-aid from Government. The British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited, gives financial aid to the two Chinese Schools situated in the Oilfield area. The medium of instruction in all Chinese Schools is Chinese (Mandarin). English is taught as a second language beginning in the Third Year.

(c) 6 English Schools; 3 of which are run by the Roman Catholic Mission, 2 by Government and 1 by the Oil Company. The total enrolment of these schools is 1,836; 1,182 boys and 674 girls. The Mission Schools are largely maintained by Mission funds and school fees. All receive grants-in-aid from Government. Two of them, situated in the Oilfield area, receive financial aid from the Oil Company. Both of the Government Schools and one of the Mission Schools have Secondary Forms, and two Chinese Schools offer first year secondary education. The total number of pupils receiving secondary education in 1954 was 230: 167 boys and 63 girls, including 11 boys with Government Regional Overseas Scholarships.

It may be mentioned, that all the schools listed under (a) (b) and (c) above are Primary Schools. There are as yet no separate Secondary Schools in Brunei.

(d) One Trade (Technical) School. This is fully maintained and belongs to the British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited. The present enrolment is 131; 77 first, 28 second and 26 third year apprentices. The practical instruction given includes: Fitting, Turning, Motor and Diesel Mechanics, Welding and Blacksmithing. On the theoretical side are included Theory of Mechanics, Workshop Practice, Electricity, Mathematics and Machine Drawings.

A number of Brunei students are attending educational institutions overseas.

Expenditure on education in 1954 was $1,551,566 compared with $36,059 in 1940 and $7,289 in 1930.

**Health**

Brunei State may be considered relatively healthy. The following diseases were of greatest incidence in 1954:

- Tropical Anaemias
- Malaria, all forms
- Helminthic diseases
- Respiratory diseases
- Inflammatory diseases of the eye
- Deficiency states
- Tuberculosis

Of these it is considered that Tuberculosis is the greatest problem because of the difficult socio-economic conditions retarding attempts at eradication. A Tuberculosis Clinic commenced work in 1953.

There is one 150-bedded State Hospital in Brunei Town, one 30-bedded Dispensary in Kuala Belait and the Oil Company also has a 150-bedded Hospital there. There are two out-station dispensaries with 16 beds, and a small Tuberculosis Hospital with 22 beds has been constructed at Kuala Belait. Three floating dispensaries serve the riverain population and are not only bringing medicine to the homes of the people but also serving as a spearhead of propaganda.

Hospital attendances for 1954 are as follows:

- Hospital in-patients : 3,762
- Hospital out-patients : 87,799
- Health Clinic attendances : 15,012
- Travelling dispensary attendances : 19,542

During 1954 the Medical Department budget amounted to $1,396,098 an increase of $294,885 over the previous year.

**Communications**

The principal airfield in the State is four miles outside Brunei Town. This was opened to small aircraft in November 1954 and there is a daily service connecting with Labuan and the oilfields, using Rapide aircraft.

The airfield is still under construction and when completed in 1956 will be to international standard Code Letter "E", suitable for use by Dakota and similar aircraft. There will then be a direct service from Singapore via Kuching to Brunei Town.

The Anduki airfield is operated by the British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited, for internal service and to Labuan. They also maintain a light railway from Seria to Badas about eight miles long.

There are 237·38 miles of roads; metalled 14·44 miles, earth 71·63 miles, bridle paths 74·80 miles.

The main ports are Brunei Town and Kuala Belait. The bulk of general cargo for Brunei is transshipped from Labuan and conveyed to the two main ports by a fleet of small coasting vessels run by the Straits Steamship Company. Monthly visits are made to the Port of Brunei Town direct from Singapore by this Company's vessels of up to 1,700 G.E.T. The British Malayan Petroleum Company also maintains a considerable fleet of L.C.Ts., and these ply mainly between Brunei Town, Labuan and Kuala Belait. In addition, numerous native-owned motor launches, tongkangs, and outboard motor boats carry on a coastal trade around the Brunei and adjacent Colonies' ports. The State runs a motor launch service connecting with the air service and, as far as possible, the steamer service in Labuan, carrying mail and passengers.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. Numbers employed in other occupations in 1954 were:

- Government service (Public Works) 1,702
- Oil mining 4,959
- Rubber 422
