PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the French sphere of Syria and the Lebanon, on the west by the Mediterranean, and on the south by Egyptian and Hedjaz territory, the boundary running from just west of Rafa on the Mediterranean to just east of Taba at the head of the Gulf of Akaba, and then north-east. On the east, the boundary is undefined.

The boundary on the north was settled by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920, but has not yet been delimited. From the Mediterranean Sea, just south of Ras-el-Nakura, and about half way between Tyre and Acre, it runs eastwards and northwards to Metullah (British), and across the Upper Jordan Valley to Banias (French). It then runs south-eastwards to Skek, and thence down the river Jeraba and Massadyie to the north-eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias and across the Lake to Semakh at its southern extremity. From Semakh, the boundary runs up the Yarmuk Valley, leaving the existing railway to Nasib in the French sphere.

Palestine comprises four zones of country. On the west, along the shores of the Mediterranean, which are deficient here in good natural harbours, is a low plain, which however, at one place, the plain of Esdraelon, stretches for a considerable distance into the interior, and separates the high lands of Galilee from those of Samaria and Judea. From the coastal plain, the country rises into a hilly plateau, which drops steeply to the east to the third zone, which is formed by the great depression down which the River Jordan runs to the Dead Sea, and which is prolonged for another 100 miles to the Red Sea as the Wadi Araba. This depression reaches a depth below sea level of 2,600 feet in the deepest portion of the Dead Sea, the surface of which is about 1,300 feet below sea level. East of the Jordan valley the country rises again, and merges into the Syrian desert.

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude: the coastal region is sub-tropical and humid; the elevated hilly zone is drier and more temperate; the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight; while, further east still, the neighbourhood of the desert makes its effect marked on both the temperature and the rainfall.

The country is generally fertile, producing barley, wheat, olives and wine, while sheep and goats are plentiful.

The chief towns are Jerusalem, the capital, Jaffa, Acre and Haifa, the three chief ports, and Gaza.

The railways consist of:

(a) The main line (4 ft. 8½ in. gauge) from Rafa, on the Egyptian Frontier, to Haifa via Ludd and Tul Keram, with branches Rafa to Beersheba, and Ludd to Jaffa in one direction, and Jerusalem in the other, and;

(b) The old Turkish line (3ft. 5½ in. gauge) from Haifa to Semakh, at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee, with a branch from Fule to Tul Keram on the main line.

Government.

After the conquest of Palestine from the Turks in 1917-18, the country remained under British military administration until 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner.

Under the Treaty of Sévres, signed on 10th August, 1920, Turkey renounced her sovereignty
over the country, and under the draft mandate submitted in December, 1920, to the Council of the League of Nations (Cmd 1176), the mandate for Palestine was to be entrusted to Great Britain.
