GIBRALTAR.

Situation and Area.

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat. 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long high mountain called "The Rock," and a very flat sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, and called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,390 feet, its length 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¼ of a mile. Its area is 1¼ square miles.

History.

The rock of Gibraltar, the Mons Calpe of the ancients, remained under the dominion of the Moors until the 15th century, when it was incorporated with the Spanish kingdom of Granada. It was captured by the British forces under Sir George Rooke, 24th July, 1704, and was ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Treaty of Utrecht was renewed by Article 2 of Treaty of Versailles, 1783. It was successfully defended by Gen. Elliot (afterwards Lord Heathfield) in the great siege of 1779-83.

General Description.

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called the Bay of Gibraltar, which is about 4 or 5 miles across, and affords good anchorage for the shipping passing through the Straits. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock are an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea and the sandy plain known as the North Front, which lies between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Linea; from the northern end the Rock runs along southward like a knife edge to the ancient site of O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind these latter lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only ¾ by ¼ mile. It is one of the most thickly inhabited places in the world, but it is not unhealthy. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden, called the Alameda. The civil population in the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south-east of the New Mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being entirely taken up with barracks, hospitals, &c., for the Military and the Navy.

Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and coaling station by shipping, and it is also an entrepôt of the trade between England and the Arabian states of Northern Africa, for which it has many advantages, having been ever since its occupation by the British a free port, or practically so.

The naval harbour is on the West side of the Rock. It is formed by three separate Moles known as the "North," "Detached" and "South" Moles. The North Mole runs westward from Devil's Tongue for about 2,900 feet, and then southward, giving a total length of over a mile. The South Mole projects into the sea for a distance of 3,660 feet in a north-westerly direction. The Detached Mole, 2,717 feet long, is so situated between these two Moles as to form a breakwater and leave two means of entrance and exit. The harbour contains a water area of 440 acres. There are three large graving docks for naval purposes, and a small dock which is available for merchant vessels of light draught.
The old wharf at Waterport has been extended and improved by the addition of a new mole, which has been provided with electrical cranes and other equipment to facilitate the handling of cargo.

About 450 persons are employed in tobacco manufactories, and about 1,200 in the coal depôts. It is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1919, 54 vessels, of together 5,650 tons (gross). No statistics of imports or exports are taken, except of wine, spirits, beer and tobacco.

The revenue is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, duties upon wine, spirits, beer, and tobacco, and licence duties and fees.

There is no executive or legislative council. The power of legislation is vested in the Governor, who is also the General commanding the garrison. The management of the drainage, watersupply, &c., is in the hands of a nominated body, called the Sanitary Commissioners. Their receipts for 1919 were 115,950l., their expenditure 113,563l., and their debt, on the 31st of Dec., 1919, 222,339l., and pesetas 807,000.

There is a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank and of the Credit Foncier d'Algerie et de Tunisie, and several private bankers.

A Government savings bank was founded in 1882, and had on 31st Dec., 1919, 2,171,72l., and pesetas 87,246; deposited by 5,219 depositors. Since the 1st Oct., 1898, the legal tender currency has been that of the United Kingdom, and the public accounts are now kept in it, but Spanish money is still freely current. The change from Spanish currency, which had previously been the legal tender, was effected under the provisions of the Orders in Council of the 9th of August, 1898. By the Bank Note Ordinance, 1914, the currency includes bank notes issued by the Government of Gibraltar. These notes are of the value of 50l., 5l., 1l., 10s. and 2s.

There is daily postal communication with England by way of Spain and France. Rates of postage: Letters, 1d. per oz.; newspapers, ½d. The internal postage rate is ½d. per ½ oz. Also direct telegraphic communication with Spain, and by cables to England, Tangier, Malta, Lisbon, and Cadiz.

Education is compulsory since the 1st of June, 1917. There are sixteen elementary schools, subsidised by Government, and several private schools, the number of scholars in average attendance being 2,152 for the school year ending 31st March, 1920. The Government-aided schools are for the most part managed by boards of the different denominations, and small fees are charged.
