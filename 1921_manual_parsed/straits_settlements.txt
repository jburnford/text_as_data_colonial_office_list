STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, comprising Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 217 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement, which now comprises also Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 108 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 280 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 720 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 183 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed, by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers about 795.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 62 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 12 miles, and its greatest breadth about 9 miles. The inhabitants, who number about 1,100, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employés of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1906 to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17th March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. At first unimportant, that trade has now assumed enormous proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula.
Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 280 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end in 1377, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bencoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca, under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

**Constitution, Law, and Justice.**

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 10 official members and 8 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

**Climate.**

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1919 was 83.2° F.; in Penang, 82.6° F.; in Province Wellesley, 83.5° F.; and in Malacca, 81.3° F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 88.3° and 75.1° F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1910 to 1919, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 175 wet days; the average monthly rainfall for the same period being 218 millimetres. In 1919 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 2,353 m.m.; in Penang 2,084 m.m.; in Province Wellesley 1,925 m.m.; in Malacca 2,151 m.m.; and in the Dindings 1,747 m.m. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have south-east, south or south-west winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.

**Population.**

At the census taken in April, 1901 and 1911, the population of the Settlements was ascertained to be as follows:

|                | 1901   | 1911   |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Singapore      | 228,555| 311,985|
| Penang, Province Wellesley, and Dindings | 258,207| 278,003|
| Malacca        | 95,487 | 124,081|
| **Total**      | **572,249**| **714,069**|

The total at the census of 1866 was 273,000.

The estimated population for the year 1920 is as follows:

|                | Singapore* | Penang† | Malacca | Total |
|----------------|------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Male           | Female     | Male    | Female  | Male  | Female |

* Inclusive of Christmas, Cocos-Keeling and Labuan Islands.
† Inclusive of Province Wellesley and Dindings.
Trade.

The ports are, except in the case of petroleum, opium, liquors and tobacco, free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmeg, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, para rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, preserved pineapples, dyestuffs, tobacco, etc. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are tapioca, rice and rubber (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and pineapples and rubber (in Singapore). The approximate quantities of some of the exports and imports in 1919 were:

Singapore and George Town (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had, on the 31st December, 1919, 637 vessels registered, of a total net tonnage of 90,413 tons.

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch a Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe weekly by British India steamers, via Negapatam and Bombay, and fortnightly services by the Peninsular and Oriental and Messageries Maritimes vessels, via Ceylon; in addition there is a fortnightly service by the Steamship Co. "Nederland"; and at frequent intervals by the Holt's, Chargeurs-Reunis, Glen, Shire, Japanese and other lines; with China and Japan twice a fortnight by the P. and O. and M.M. lines, and by other lines frequently; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla via Hong Kong and by Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok by Straits steamship and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Netherlands India Cos.' steamers; with Australian ports frequently by British India, Burns Philp, Ocean Steamship Co., Western Australia Steam Navigation Co., and other lines direct, and occasionally via Colombo, with the sailings thence of Orient Packets; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, weekly by the British India Cos.' steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Co., British India, Apcar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, etc., by local lines. Most of the larger steamers call at Penang. Letters from England reach Singapore in from 27 to 30 days. Services have not yet become normal.

Nine sub-marine cables radiate from Singapore: 4 to Penang, thence to Madras (2), Colombo (1), Deli, Sumatra (1); 1 to Batavia, thence to Cocos (1); 1 to Ranjowangie, thence to Darwin (2); 1 to Hong Kong; 1 to Cochin-China, thence to Hong Kong, and 1 to Labuan, thence to Hong Kong. There are also Government telegraph lines from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, Kedah, Kelantan, Siam, Johore, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur was opened for traffic in June, 1909. There are 543 miles of telegraph line, 36 miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley and 11,413 miles of telephone line. There is a telephone exchange worked by the Oriental Telephone Co. in Singapore, and exchanges are worked by the Post Office in Penang, Province Wellesley and Malacca. A section of the Federated Malay States Railway system connecting Singapore and Bangkok Province Wellesley from South to North with a section from Bukit Mertajam to Prai. Another section of the system runs from the docks of Singapore† to Kranji, and a third section connects Malacca with the main line at Tampin, in Negri Sembilan.

Education.

The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

* With a maximum of 4 cents on each newspaper published locally or registered at the G.P.O., London, and addressed to any place in the Straits Settlements, Federated Malay States, or Johore.

† The extensive docks owned by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company were acquired by the Government in 1905, and are now controlled by a Board, composed of members appointed by the Governor under "the Straits Settlements Ports Ordinance." Graving and wet docks and other works are in progress.
By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unsectarian. There is a reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1919 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls) | 8 | 3,275 | 3,058 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls) | 33 | 13,634 | 12,710 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls) | 193 | 12,712 | 11,367 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls) | 11 | 422 | 331 |
| Total | 245 | 30,043 | 27,466 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold and by an order of the King in Council dated the 17th day of May, 1920, the fineness of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece has been reduced.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively. The half-dollar is unlimited legal tender. Under an Ordinance passed in 1917 currency notes of denominations 25 cents and ten cents have been issued to the public owing to shortage of subsidiary silver. These notes are only legal tender to the extent of $2.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the International Banking Corporation, the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; and Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, Chinese Commercial Bank, Communication Bank, The Yokohama Specie Bank, The Ho Hong Bank, The Oversea Chinese Bank and The China Southern Bank and the Banque Industrielle de Chine.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation at the end of 1919 was $156,273 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the undermentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec., 1899—$3,920,000
" " 31st August, 1909—$27,569,475
" " 31st July, 1914—$43,834,548
" " 1915—$48,688,648
" " 1916—$64,018,317
" " 31st August, 1917—$85,012,496
" " 31st Dec., 1918—$86,408,740
" " 1919—$817,631,973
" " 39th Sept., 1920—$124,541,461

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1919, the deposits amounted to $1,488,256.

The native Weights are—

1 kati = 16 tahil = 1 lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 5333½ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipalities at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, administered by Boards of Commissioners, nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1916 was $5,491,352; and the expenditure $5,172,781.

LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-
west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15'
E. long. Its area is 28'6 square miles. It is
distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about
six miles; from Brunei, the capital of the
Protected State of that name, about forty miles;
and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.
The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches,
and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

An attempt was made by the East India
Company's servants, who were expelled from
Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish
a trading station in Labuan, but the project was
soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the
history of the island begins with its cession to
Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei.
It was then uninhabited. The reason for the
cession, given in the treaty, by which the island
was handed over to Great Britain, was that it
was "desirable that British ships shall have some
port where they may careen and refit, and deposit
such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary
for the carrying on of the trade with the
dominions of Brunei," and the consideration
given by Great Britain was an undertaking to
suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was at first occupied only as a naval
station under the control of a naval officer, and
the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was
deferred until 1848. From that date until the
end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate
Colony. Until 1869 it was assisted by grants-in-
aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help
was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported
itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty
years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a
head, and, as it was thought that the island could
be more economically governed in connection with
the territories of the British North Borneo
Company, the administration was entrusted,
from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the
Company, whose principal representative in
Borneo was given a commission as Governor of
Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at
the end of 1905, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor
of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also
Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining
a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1906,
Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements,
and declared part of the settlement of Singapore.
On the 1st of December, 1912, the island was
constituted a separate settlement.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded
great hopes for the success of the new settlement
were based upon the existence of rich coal
deposits in the island, but hitherto the com-
panies formed to develop these coal resources
have not met with great success. In 1893, the
Central Borneo Company was re-constructed
under the name of the New Central Borneo Com-
pany, who transferred their undertaking to the
Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company,
in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December,
1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited.
The mines have been closed since the beginning
of 1911.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour),
perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing
23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty (not
at present in use), and vessels drawing 15 feet
alongside the coaling jetties.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton and
H.M. ships with coal, by agreement, at 15s. per
ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the
neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archi-
pelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests,
camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans,
tortoise-shell, and bêche-de-mer, which are for-
warded by the Labuan traders to Singapore.
Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are
estimated to be under cultivation. There are sago
factories in the island, where the raw material
received from the coast is converted into sago
flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is a branch of the Government Post Office
Savings Bank in Labuan, but no other bank. The
currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary
coins. Straits notes are also available in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays and other
natives from Brunei, and Chinese, the latter
being mostly petty traders.

There is a vernacular school maintained by
Government, which also gives a grant towards the
support of the school conducted by the Society
for the Propagation of the Gospel.

A reservoir owned by the Government supplies
the town of Victoria and shipping with drinking
water.

The Eastern Extension, Australasian and China
Telegraph Company has a station on the island.
connected by cable with Singapore, Hong Kong and North Borneo. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

A weekly service of steamers plying between Singapore, North Borneo Ports and the Philippines provides Labuan with a regular communication with these places; there are, in addition, local coasting steamers. A number of larger seagoing vessels call at the Port for bunker and cargo coal and water.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are supplied by a Navy contractor.

The chief sources of revenue are harbour dues, land rents and licences.

**BRUNEI.**

H.H. Mohamed Jemalulalam, C.M.G., Sultan.

Brunei is a State lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. It is 770 nautical miles distant from Singapore.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta, of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the district of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 4,000 square miles, containing a population of about 32,000, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Tutong, Belait and Tamburong.

In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, and a further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915 a separate Resident was appointed for Brunei, and the appointment of Assistant Resident discontinued.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000. Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 300 in the capital. Native industries include cloth weaving and dyeing, brass foundries and the manufacture of silversmiths' ware. The principal imports are cloth and sundries, and the principal exports coal, wild rubber, rotans, sago and damar. The trade, to which an impetus was given by the inauguration of the new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed. Several companies are engaged in planting Para rubber, while oil prospecting is being vigorously developed.

A cutch factory, established by a London syndicate, is at work at Brunei, and coal is worked by the Raja of Sarawak at Muara (Brocketon) at the mouth of the Brunei river, under the terms of a concession granted in 1882. The output of cutch in 1918 was about 38,371 cwts., valued at $361,501. The output of coal in 1918, was 29,565 tons, value $443,275.

The Sultan would derive a considerable income from yearly cession payments made by the State of North Borneo and Sarawak Governments were they not mortgaged for years to come. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amounts recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from land and mining rents, from an opium monopoly under Government control, from the collection of customs duties, and from purchased Cession moneys. About half of the original Cession monies have now been purchased by the Government. The year 1913 saw the first revenue obtained from oil, the British Borneo Petroleum Syndicate paying $1,000 minimum export duty.

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years previous to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters reached a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889 by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1895 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. Clementi Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Chief Secretary and to the High Commissioner for the Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States,* to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remained unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

No further meetings of this nature have been held since 1903, as the necessity for them has been removed by an important development of the principle of Federation, which was introduced in 1909. In that year a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." The Council consists of the High Commissioner, as President, the Chief Secretary, the Sultans of Perak, Selangor and Pahang, the Yam Tuan of Negri Sembilan, the four British Residents, the Legal Adviser and four unofficial members, nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. Provision is made in the agreement for the addition, if desired, of the heads of one or more public departments and of a corresponding number of unofficials. The Council meets at least once a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the four States. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

* The title of this post has now been altered to Chief Secretary.

#### Railways

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (120 miles), extending from Johore Bahru...
at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore Island, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas, the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Selangor, and Perak, then enters Province Wellesley, passing Prai—the port opposite Penang Harbour—about 472 miles from Johore Bahru, and thence proceeds through the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis, to the Siamese frontier station of Padang Besar 580 miles from Singapore. Through traffic with the Siamese State Railways was opened on July 1st, 1918. The distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,188 miles.

The East Coast Line proceeds Northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan and Pahang, and is completed as far as Kuala Lipis—the capital of Pahang—261½ miles from Johore Bahru. Between Kuala Lipis and Tanah Merah in Kelantan a distance of 155 miles, the permanent location of the line has been definitely decided and construction is now proceeding northward of Kuala Lipis. A section of 32 miles in Kelantan, between Tanah Merah and Tumpat, on the East coast, is open for traffic, and construction is now proceeding southward. Between this section and Ootapao Junction, a section of 12 miles on the Kelantan side of the frontier, has been opened, and construction is also proceeding on the Siamese section of 145 miles between the Siamese boundary and Ootapao Junction.

Branch lines connect the main line with the ports on the West Coast at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, and Port Weld.

At Prai, on the mainland opposite Penang, an extensive scheme of deep water Wharves is under construction.

A causeway carrying two lines of rails and a roadway is being built across the Johore Strait to connect the island of Singapore with the peninsula.

The total length of line now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States railway administration is 948½ miles.

The line is of metre gauge. On the mail trains on the West Coast main line there are sleeping saloons and restaurant cars. The expenditure on capital account (including lines not open for traffic), was $123,681,858 up to 31st December, 1919, and this has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States.

Perak.

H.H. Iskandar Shah ibni Almerhum Rathiallah, Sultan.

Perak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State, which has an area of 7,800 square miles, is well watered, the Perak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus), the Rinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungki, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills, on Gunong Kledang, and on Gunong Arang Para, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 74,102 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is (a) 834½ of metalled and (b) 942½ of unmetalled cart roads, 1,015 miles of bridle and other paths.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Perak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Perak, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory, which was taken over on the 16th July, 1909*, and incorporated in the Upper Perak District, exceeds 1,000 square miles in area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legeh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasek on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

Selangor.

H.H. Sir Ala'idin Sulaiman ibni Almerhum Raja Musa, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Selangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Perak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

The total area is estimated at 3,156 square miles, with a coast line extending for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Perak and Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes.
this State, as in Perak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines.

The climate is uniform, and may be described as hot and moist. The nights are cool. The average maximum temperature in the low country is 91 and the average minimum temperature is 71. The rainfall varies considerably; as much as 104½ inches having been registered. The wettest seasons are from March to May, and from October to December.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 46,718 (1911 Census). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 59 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence. The telegraph system extends all over the State, and the telephone, with the exchanges at Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Port Swettenham, Kuala Selangor, Banting, Rawang Kajang and Kuala Kubu, is worked over about 4,680 miles of wire. In addition, there are 15 miles of underground cable containing 1,467 miles of wire.

There are 164 schools in the State, comprising one Government English School, 67 Government Vernacular Schools, 86 Grant-in-aid Vernacular Schools and 10 Grant-in-aid English Schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels, exclusive of native craft, registered in 1919 was 2,214,218.

The total revenue of the State in 1919, was £25,922,875, and the expenditure £26,464,005. There is no public debt.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land. The only import duties are those charged on spirituous liquors, beers, petroleum, and tobacco. In 1919 the gross total value of imports was £56,289,298, and the export, £100,848,202.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1919 was 190,160 pikuls, valued at £22,962,167. The area alienated for mining is 64,381 acres, and a labour force of 37,352 is employed in this industry. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress some years ago, but has now been almost entirely abandoned owing to the fall in price. There are 45,493 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides. Most of the large estates have been converted into or sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1919 the area under rubber cultivation was approximately 592,860 acres. The value of cultivated rubber exported during 1919 was £70,290,265.

The road mileage is: metallled cart roads, 662; gravelled cart roads, 76; natural cart roads, 29; and bridle paths, 145 miles.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Sir Muhammad, K.C.M.G., Yang di Pertuan of Sri Menanti, and Chiefs.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan dates, as at present constituted, from 1895, but a similar Federation was already in existence before that year. The present Federation consists of the following States: Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungei Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at the Coast, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Kuala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and at Tampin.

The total area of the State is about 2,550 square miles. The population, which stood at 130,199 at the census taken in 1911 and is now estimated at 156,679 is mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Tamils.

The value of imports amounted to £13,569,224 in 1919, and that of exports to £42,296,465. The revenue of the State, which in 1919 amounted to £7,111,638, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1919, 17,614 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 445,029 acres for building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative. The Malay population, numbering some £73,560, is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coco-nuts.

During 1919 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:—Rubber 212,558 acres, rice 29,840 acres, and coco-nuts 11,135 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses 68 Malay vernacular schools, two English schools and one Tamil school.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 421 miles of metallled and 9 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 236 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts.
A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Sultan Abdullah ibni Almerhum Sultan Ahmad Mauham Shah, Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, having an estimated area of some 14,000 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for house-boats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast line of the Federated Malay States Railways was opened for traffic as far as Kuala Lipis on the 15th October, 1917.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital, which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

There is a motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 83 miles, and from Raub to Bentong, via Tras and Tranum, a distance of 30 miles.

A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Raub, Kuala Lipis, and Bentong, and has been extended to Kuantan and Pekan on the east coast.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan (104 miles), from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, and from Bentong to Kuantan (147½ miles), have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungei Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles.

The total revenue of the State during 1919 amounted to $2,918,942, and the expenditure to $3,146,888.

In the absence of complete records, it is only possible to estimate the population approximately at 146,400. The census of 1911 gave a total of 113,708.

MALAY STATES NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEDERATION.

In addition to the territories comprised in the Federated Malay States, the British sphere in the Malay Peninsula includes the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu.

Johore had entered into a Treaty with Great Britain as early as 1855, and in 1885, the Sultan, by an agreement dated the 11th of December, placed his foreign relations under the control of the British Government. He also undertook to receive a British Agent at his Court when required to do so, but no such appointment was made until January, 1910, when, in consequence of a request received from the Sultan, Mr. D. G. Campbell, Resident of Negri Sembilan, was transferred to Johore to act as His Highness's Adviser.

In May, 1914, the Sultan suggested that, with a view to the development of the State, the Agreement of 1885 should be revised to permit the appointment of a General Adviser with powers similar to those exercised by British Residents in the Federated Malay States. His Majesty's Government accepted the proposal and a subsidiary agreement was accordingly signed by His Highness and the Governor of the Straits Settlements on the 12th of May.

The other States came under British protection in 1909 as a consequence of a Treaty, signed at Bangkok on March 10th of that year, by which Siam transferred to Great Britain all her rights over them. The transfer was formally effected in July, 1909, and British officers were then appointed to reside at the Courts of the native rulers, and to assist them in the administration of their territories.

The officer administering the Government of the Straits Settlements is His Majesty's High Commissioner for all Protected States in the Peninsula.

All these states, as well as the Federated Malay States and Brunei, are included in the Imperial Penny Postage system.

JOHORE.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the north by Pahang, on the north-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the west by the Straits of Malacca, on the south by the Strait north of Singapore, and on the east by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,500 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The area alienated for cultivation extends to some 650,000 acres of which upwards of 200,000 acres are under rubber, and a further 200,000 acres are under coconuts. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the north-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the north, which, during part of its course, forms the boundary with Pahang, and the Johore, which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bharu, the capital, situated on the Straits opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Pengaram in Batu Pahat. The population of Johore Bharu is about 10,000. The population of the whole State as determined at the census of 1911 is 180,632, about two-thirds of whom are Malays. The population may now amount to 220,000 or more.

The principal products of Johore are rubber (27,890 tons in 1919), gambier (4,449 tons), copra (18,772 tons), tapioca (7,855 tons) and arecanuts (15,149 tons).

The mineral resources of the States have hitherto been much neglected, but the discovery of a rich tin field in the East Coast has resulted in considerable activity. During 1919, the export of tin ore amounted to 1,843 tons valued at $2,638,600. Iron is found in abundance, but owing to the absence of coal no attempt has been made to work it.

The public revenue in 1919 was $11,002,777 while the expenditure amounted to $8,223,862. The public debt of the State on the 31st December, 1919, was nil.

Returns show the value of imports to be $29,524,700 (3,444,548L.), and of exports to be $71,279,930 (8,315,902L.).

The Johore State Railway, to which reference has been made above (see Federated Malay States), runs from Kuala Gemas on the Negri Sembilan border to Johore Bharu, a distance of 120½ miles. The line, which was opened for traffic in July, 1909, was constructed by the Railway Department of the Federated Malay States, the necessary funds being lent by the Federation. It is now leased to the Federated Malay States for a period of years at an annual rental.

KEDAH.

H.H. Sir Abdul Hamid Halimshah ibin Ahmad Tajudin, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Kedah is a State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula situated between the parallels of 5° 5' and 6° 35' N. lat. and the meridians of 99° 35' and 101° 10' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (north and east) by the States of Singgora and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sanglang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.
Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah. Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded by Kedah to Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1800, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of $10,000 is, under the treaty of 1869, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the south. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the north of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern watershed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 105 miles in length and about 65 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi groups, about 3,800 square miles. The four highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Bintang (6,103 feet), Gunong Kangar (4,760 feet), Gunong Jerai (3,978 feet) and Bukit Perak (2,823 feet). Gunong Raja, on Langkawi Island, is 2,950 feet high.

**History.**

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammadanism in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like the other States in the Peninsula, it was, at various times, under the domination of Burmah, Aceh, Malacca and Siam. Like the other States, too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul Perlis, and part of Singgora on the north, and Krian on the south, and under a weaker man, or upon the rising of a stronger raja beyond the borders, its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1641), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Opperhoofden (Commandants) in Kedah from 1664 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpectant Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan, made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese, and held the country from April until October, but was later conquered by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammad Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1841 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of him. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kedah.

**General Description.**

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams (14,717)—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammadans. There are over 8,000 Siamese. Only a few families of the aborigines (Sakeis) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River. They numbered 105 all told at the 1911 census.

South Kedah, the area lying south of the mountain known as Kedah Peak (Gunong Jerai), is for the most part populated with Europeans, Chinese and Tamils, planting rubber, coconuts and tapioca. There is also a Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River and in the low lying lands along the coast. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally a heavy fertile clay. A quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang, and thence is shipped to the Federated Malay States.

The population of Kedah was 245,986 at the 1911 census and is now estimated to be about 300,000; 80 per cent. belong to the Malay race, over 13 per cent. are Chinese, 3-3 per cent. are Siamese, and 2-5 are Indians.

Galena has been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered.

**Climate.**

The climate resembles that of Perak. Meteorological returns kept in ten places record an average shade temperature in the daytime rising to over 90 deg. F. and falling to nearly 70 deg. F. at night. The driest months are January to March and the wettest August to October, when half the annual rainfall occurs, averaging from 100 to 130 inches a year. Cholera has sometimes broken out in prolonged droughts, but the provision of a good water supply, which is now completed, should prevent this. The health on rubber and other estates is good.

**Communications.**

Steamers ply between Penang and Semiling, and Yen (in South Kedah), and Sala, and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawi Island.

A metalled road connects Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 48 miles. A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (25 miles), and a road which branches off at the 12th mile connects the State with Singgora. Another road is being pushed forward towards the Patani frontier, through Langgar. A metalled road has been made to Baling and North Perak. There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in...
South Kedah with the towns; 160 miles of canals are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The Federated Malay States railway administration has extended its railway service through Kedah into Perlis. The line leaves the main line at Bukit Mertajam, in Province Wellesley and is 98 miles in length to the Siamese frontier. Trains have been running regularly since October, 1916. A connection through Perlis, with the Siamese railway system has been completed, establishing railway communication between Bangkok and Singapore.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There is an English school, and a Malay girls' school in Alor Star. There are 50 Malay schools.

Constitution.

Until recently the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1905, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

On the 23rd July, 1905, the Sultan, by an edict, appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country.

The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda, Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H.H. Tunku Mahmud. The Adviser and the Chief Judge are ex-officio members, and two members may be nominated.

In 1913, the Sultan's health became such that it was necessary to appoint his eldest son, Tunku Ibrahim, as Regent, pending the restoration of the Sultan's health.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1905 from Siam was of $2,600,000 at the rate of 6 per cent. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government at 4 per cent. The Federated Malay States Government paid the interest, $120,953, due at the time of the transfer, and added it on to the capital, thus making the loan amount to $2,720,953.

The public revenue and expenditure during the eight years A.H. 1331 (A.D. 1913) to A.H. 1338 (A.D. 1920) were respectively:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |

PERLIS.

H.H. Syed Alwi, Raja.

Perlis is a small State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula North of Kedah. Its area is 316 square miles.

Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano. Perlis has a bi-weekly steamer communication with Penang, and has a good system of telegraphs and telephones. There are fifteen miles of metalled roads, and thirty miles of earth roads.

The population is about 35,000. The public revenue in A.H. 1335 was $264,976; in A.H. 1336 $306,924; in A.H. 1337 $294,044, and in A.H. 1338 (approximately A.D. 1929), $443,443. The expenditure in A.H. 1335 was $193,776; in A.H. 1336, $247,583; in A.H. 1337 $243,885; and in A.H. 1338 $277,994. The revenue for the year A.H. 1338 is estimated at $264,409, and the expenditure at $316,389. The State, by loans made in 1905 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. The total debt of the State is now $495,394. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are four other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

KELANTAN.

H.H. Sir Mohamed IV. bin Almerhum Sultan Muhammed, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

The state of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 5° 45' and 6° 15' north, and between longitudes 101° 23' and 102° 40' east. It is bounded on the north by the China Sea; on the east by Trengganu; on the south by Pahang; and on the west by Perak and the Siamese Monthon of Petani. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,870 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the state according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in July, 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the south. Gunong Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries,
comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Talab, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1911 Census was 286,751, including 108 Europeans, 268,707 Malays, 9,844 Chinese, 5,355 Siamese, 731 Indians, and 2,006 others. A large number of Chinese agricultural labourers are now being imported for the rubber estates.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 12,000 people. It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has a school attended by some 300 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Kuala Krai has been completed. It is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Putch, Kuala Krai, Chehil and Bangnara. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 4,000), Bachok (population 2,000), Talab (population 2,000), all on the coast, and Pasir Putch (population 2,000), the head quarters of the southern district of the State. The Trunk Road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai lacks a few bridges to make it usable in dry weather.

Pasir Putch is now connected by road with Kota Bharu, and the road is practicable in all weathers. The East Coast Railway, which will eventually connect Kelantan with Singapore and Bangkok, has been completed as regards the section between Tumpat and Tanah Merah.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the annual harvest of which amounts to 70,000 tons. Kelantan is one of the few Malay States which export padi and rice. Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease, but suffer severely from the ravages of squirrels. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, Para rubber has been largely planted in recent years. In addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. Most of the estates have reached the tapping stage. There is now a steady output of rubber, the quality of which is of a high standard. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, and some 8,000 head of cattle are annually exported to the Singapore market. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of silk sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Since the extension of British protection to Kelantan, there have been several applications for land for tin mining.

The tin mining industry is likely to increase when the railway is able to carry supplies to the back country.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, cattle, padi and rice, betelnuts, fish, and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, opium, sugar, timber, salt, and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot, and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plain the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90°F., or goes below 69°F., except in January, when 64°F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoons keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 103 inches a year.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, but a coin made from an alloy of tin and lead and called pittis is also current in the bazaar; 480 pittis equal one dollar.

Regular steam communication has been established between Singapore and Kelantan.

TRENGGANU.

H.H. Slean bin Alverhum Zenalabidin, Sultan. British Adviser, J. L. Humphreys, 1,470.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 4° 30' and 5° 45' North, and longitude 102° 15' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 6,000 square miles.

The total population of the State, as recorded by the census taken in March, 1911, is 154,073. This total is made up as follows:

- European and kindred races ... 10
- Malay races ... 149,379
- Chinese ... 4,169
- Indians ... 61
- Other nationalities ... 464

There are no roads (except 10 miles at Kuala Trengganu), railways, or telegraphs; communication with the interior is entirely by means of the rivers and good native paths. There is a telephone exchange at Kuala Trengganu.

The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 13,991.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman, Kretai, Dungun, Paka, Marang, Ibar, Stiu, and Beaut.

The public revenue and expenditure in 1919 were $782,435 and $756,977 respectively.

The total value of exports from Trengganu in 1919, was approximately $3,816,670. The principal exports were:

| Value |
|-------|
| Fish (dry and salted) ... $1,044,966 |
| Tin ore ... 828,966 |
| Copra ... 455,322 |
| Black pepper ... 185,873 |
| Wolfram ore ... 611,670 |

The total value of imports into Trengganu from Singapore in 1919, was $1,911,014. The principal imports were:

| Value |
|-------|
| Rice ... $624,462 |
| Cotton piece goods ... 419,340 |
| Tobacco, cigars and cigarettes ... |
| Petroleum ... 120,054 |

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the north-east monsoon, from November to February.

The total rainfall recorded in 1910 was 101.48 inches. The total rainfall in 1911 was 137.82 inches. In 1912 it was 104.96 inches. In 1913 the rainfall in the three districts of Kemaman, Kretai, and Kuala Trengganu was 134.74, 123.30, and 121 inches respectively; and in 1914, 78.81, 71, and 118 inches; at Kretai in 1915, 128.47 inches, in 1916, 124.21 inches, in 1917, 153.26 inches, in 1918, 126.70, and in 1919, 117.13. The temperature ranges between 63° and 92° F., the greatest range in 24 hours being 25°. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee, and pepper.

During part of the north-east monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable. British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909; on this date a Commissioner from the Siamese Government surrendered in the presence of the Sultan and his principal Chiefs, the suzerainty formerly exercised over the State by Siam, to a British Officer (Mr. W. L. Conlay), appointed to accompany the former to Trengganu for the purpose of notifying the transfer, and of assuming the position of British Agent resident in the State.

The suzerainty of Siam was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the Bunga Mas to Bangkok. This tribute will not be rendered in future either to Siam or to Great Britain.

An Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainal Abidin was signed in Singapore on the 22nd April, 1910.

This agreement of four articles provides that mutual help shall be rendered by the two Governments, and for the rendition of fugitive criminals. It also provides for the appointment of a British Officer to reside in Trengganu to be an Agent with functions similar to those of a Consular Officer. His Majesty's Government undertake to protect the Government and the State of Trengganu and all its Dependencies from attack by foreign enemies, and the Trengganu Government surrenders the management of all political matters with Foreign Governments to His Britannic Majesty's Government. The limitation of mining and agricultural concessions to any person other than natives and subjects of Trengganu is also provided for.

This agreement was amended on May 24th, 1919. Under the amended agreement the Sultan agrees to accept a British Officer, called the British Adviser, whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues.

The ruling line of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainal Abidin, through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

The State is included within the Imperial Penny Postage System, and the universal Postal Union, under the regulations approved by the Convention of Rome, on the 26th May, 1906.
