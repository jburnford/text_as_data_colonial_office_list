TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 69 miles, and its average breadth 64 miles, and its area is 1,862 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Boeas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1596, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The estimated population of Trinidad and Tobago at 31st December, 1919, was 386,707. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 129,756. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of seven members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted in 1898, and now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, the Inspector-General of Constabulary, the Director of Public Works, the Surgeon-General, the Protector of Immigrants, the Receiver-General, and the Collector of Customs, and of such other persons (unofficial members), as the Governor may appoint. The unofficial members hold their seats for five years, and are at present eleven in number.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Government acquired in May, 1910, the floating graving dock and workshops formerly worked by the Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company under agreement with the Government, and the concern is now being carried on by the Government as a business administration. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 65 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the administration. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples. The quantities exported in

The minerals at present worked are chiefly asphalt, petroleum, and manjak.
north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1915, 24 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 4,000 miles of telephone have been corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.
The population in December, 1913, was 886,707. The minerals at present worked are chiefly limestone, French, and Spanish, and asphalt, petroleum, and mica.

The population is chiefly composed of...
Asphalt.—An asphalt lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the Ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain. It is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of 10,000l., and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease was for 21 years from 1st January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from 1st February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of 4,000l. a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from asphalt (the greater part of which came from the Lake) in 1919 was 29,791l.

Petroleum.—At the close of 1919 there were thirteen Companies engaged in the production of Oil in the Colony. The number of wells drilled during the year was 53, bringing the total number drilled at 31st December, 1919, to 463, of which 273 are on Crown Lands. The Royalty paid by operating Companies on oil won from Crown Lands during 1919 amounted to 17,205l. as against 18,314l. in 1918.

The quantity of oil extracted during 1919 was 64,436,632 imperial gallons, a decrease of 8,435,766 gallons as compared with 1918. The quantity exported amounted to 49,190,725 gallons valued at 803,384l., as against 43,597,920 gallons valued at 542,578l. exported in 1918. The principal Oil Companies engaged in the winning of Oil are the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Petroleum Development Company, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease; the United British Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, partly from their own and partly from Crown Lands; the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease and from private lands at Barrackpore; and the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaquite. There are still large areas of Crown Lands under exploration licences to the Trinidad Petroleum Development Company, Limited, and the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited. When the geological surveys have been completed certain portions of these areas will be taken up, either under prospecting licence or lease, and the remainder will revert to the Crown. The total area of Crown Lands held by Companies under lease, prospecting and exploration licences aggregates some 387,000 acres. Two large refineries are engaged in the manufacture of oil fuel, petrol, and kerosene, while two or three small topping plants produce petrol, distillate and residual oils. The Admiralty have also taken several cargoes of crude oil and fuel oil during the past year.

Satisfactory progress was being made in the direction of the establishment of a fruit trade, and in 1905-6, 4,259l. worth of fruit was exported to the United Kingdom as a commencement of the industry, and in 1910, it had increased to 19,952l. There was a decrease in 1917 to 464l., and in 1918 to 899l. due to a lack of shipping facilities consequent on the war. The value of Fruit exports in 1919 was £2,062. The prospects of the banana and rubber cultivations, which have been taken up in recent years, are very encouraging.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about 100,000l. sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. About one-fourth, one-eighth, and one-third of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States of America respectively.

The following table gives the direction of the import trade for the last five years, and shows the effect which the war has had in deflecting the trade with the United Kingdom to other markets. The share of the United Kingdom has dropped from 31·2 per cent. in 1915 to 16·7 per cent. in 1919, while the share of the United States has increased from 29·5 per cent. in 1915 to 39·1 per cent. in 1919:

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The mean temperature for the year was 76 and the rainfall 69·73.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1911, 59,796), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1915, 24 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 4,000 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

By Ordinance No. 24 of 1914, Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city, and its powers and duties were further extended by Ordinances Nos. 25 and 28 of 1914, and No. 36 of 1915. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.
The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1911 (census), 8,667), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1911 (census), 4,020). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1919, was £98,612., the expenditure, £100,395., and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was £340,951. on the 31st December, 1919. This includes the loan of £85,000l. for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,264,891 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1919, was estimated to be approximately 664,001 acres. About 481,901 acres are under cultivation; 600,890 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

Under a contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company a weekly trip around the island and including the island ward of Tobago, calling at all the principal ports, is maintained.

The Government own two small steamers which maintain communication to the island resorts between Port of Spain and the Bocas, including the prison establishments and the lighthouse.

The railway was commenced by a line between Port of Spain and Arima, 16 miles, opened in 1876, and by subsequent extensions the railway system now consists of the Port of Spain—Arima—Sangre Grande line (opened in 1897) 29 miles along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast. The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1880, San Fernando in 1882, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.

The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabaque in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction, 14½ miles from Port of Spain in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.

The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line north of San Fernando (33 miles) in an easterly direction in Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles, and

The Cipero tramway, to the south of San Fernando, also proceeding by another route to Princes Town, which, with branches (13½ miles), was merged into the railway system in 1912.

The total length of this system is now 123 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 6 to 8 trains daily each way.

In connection with the railway at San Fernando, two small fast steamers make five trips a week to La Prea, near the celebrated pitch lake, the oilfields, Cedros, and to the south-western part of the island at Iacoos, stopping at five intermediate stopping places, carrying passengers, the mails and goods.

The railway stations are in telegraphic communication one with the other on all parts of the system open to the public, and there is a telephone line south-west of San Fernando along the steamer route, giving a total length of about 114 miles of telegraph and about 65 miles of telephone lines, in addition to about 15 miles of telephone line for railway use alone.

The total receipts from the railways, railway-steamers, telegraphs and telephones for the year 1919 amounted to £216,463., and the working expenses to £218,124., exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to £48,052. The high cost of fuel is responsible for the increased expenditure, but the engines are being adapted to burn oil fuel and a considerable saving will in future be made.

The total number of passengers carried during 1919 was 1,970,488. The total tonnage of goods (including canes, 65,944 tons) was 225,214 tons.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and about 99 out-offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada and Saint Croix, and thence via Canada or the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 90½ miles, constructed by the Government.

The wireless telegraph system, established in 1906 to bring Tobago into telegraphic communication with Trinidad, gave satisfactory results during the year 1919.

Wireless communication with British Guiana has been satisfactorily established, and during cable interruptions all traffic between Trinidad and British Guiana is dealt with by the Port of Spain wireless station.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 48 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides a number of steamers calling for bunkercoal, oil and orders:

Royal Mail Steam Packet Co., London Direct Line, Glasgow Direct Line, Leyland Line, Harrison Line, Compagnie General Transatlantique Royal Dutch Mail, La Veloce (Navigazione Italiana), James Nourse, Ltd., Trinidad Line (Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co., Ltd.), Lampart and Holt, Prince Line, Ltd., and Navigacion Fluvial y Costanera De Venezuela. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

The ocean steamers of the Royal Mail S.P. Co. make Port of Spain their headquarters and connect here with the Company's inter-colonial steamers.

The largest steamers calling regularly are those of the Lampart and Holt Line, Cie. General Transatlantique and the Royal Mail S.P. Co. These steamers find no difficulty in coming well within the limits of the harbour. The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

| Within Colony | ... | 1d. |
| To U.K., India and British Colonies, also U.S.A. | ... | 1d. |
| To other places | ... | 2½d. |

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government and in dollars by the public, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1903 an Ordinance providing for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into
force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been issued, the total value in circulation at 31st December, 1919, amounting to 208,342L.

Government Savings Banks are established in 18 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1919, was 28,154, with deposits amounting to 420,284L. The savings banks are largely made use of by the East Indians, of whom at the 31st December, there were 12,716 depositors with 144,311L. to their credit.

The Private Banks are the Colonial Bank, paid up capital 900,000L., with a note circulation in the Colony estimated at 312,500L.; the Royal Bank of Canada, paid up capital 3,541,667L., with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of 312,500L.; and Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company, Limited, paid up capital of 500,000L. In addition to engaging in banking business of every character, both the Colonial Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada have savings bank branches and pay the same rate of interest as is paid by the Government Savings Bank, viz. 3 per cent. A branch of the National City Bank of New York, paid up capital 5,208,334L., has also recently been opened in the Colony.

OPENINGS FOR THE INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL.—Of the industries which offer inducements to investors of capital, in Trinidad and Tobago, the cultivation of cocoa is perhaps the most attractive, and profitable investments are to be secured either in

(a) the formation of an estate,
(b) the purchase of an established estate, or
(c) the investment of capital on the security of an established estate.

Sound investments for capital can usually be obtained for sums under $1,000 (208L. 6s. 8d.) at 10%, from $1,000 up to $6,000 (1,250L.) at 8%; and over $6,000 at 6 or 7%.

The price of sugar, owing to the war, has risen considerably, and manufacturing profits have been very large during the last two years. In addition to the canes grown by the factory-owners on their estates, a large proportion is grown by farmers and sold to the factories at prices which at present leave a large margin of profit. The cultivation of farmers' canes is increasing so considerably that it is doubtful whether the present factories are of sufficient capacity to handle any further increase, and the erection of another central factory on a suitable site would probably be a sound investment, and if worked on a co-operative basis would be of great benefit to the sugar industry of the Colony.

The oil industry is progressing so favourably that carefully chosen investments are worthy of attention.

Coconut cultivation is rapidly extending, and many enquiries have been made for the investment of capital in this industry. Owners are holding on to their estates and the profitable returns derived therefrom. There are lands available for forming new estates.

The lime industry affords opportunities for profitable investments with quick returns.

Fibre cultivation for the manufacture of pulp for paper is likely to be a prominent feature among the coming agricultural industries of the Colony.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), the Roman Catholic Institutions, St. Mary's College and the Convent School in Port of Spain, and Naparima College (Presbyterian)—the two latter being affiliated to the Royal College. Attached to these institutions are two scholarships of 700L. which are granted annually at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire, one being confined to agricultural Science.

There were—at the end of December, 1918—174 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 369 on those of St. Mary's College, 95 in the Naparima College, and 329 St. Joseph Convent School.

The elementary schools are now 294 in number, 52 of which are secular schools, supported entirely by the Government, and 242 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the practising schools and two assisted schools 5s. per month is charged. There are two Government and four denominational colleges for teachers, in which 52 students are trained. The Government schools in 1919 had 8,287 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 40,194.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 48,481, with an average daily attendance of about 26,985. The teaching of practical agriculture now proves part of the daily routine in the majority of boys' and mixed schools in the Colony. 228 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1919.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institution for the instruction of the blind.
