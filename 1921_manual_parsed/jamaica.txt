JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 42' 20" and 18° 32' 30", and W. long. 76° 11' 55" and 78° 23' 35". It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,450 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,388 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the south-west, and the Rio Grande in the north-east. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 57,379 in 1911, is situated on the south coast of the Island, and has a fine harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 38' and 81° 30' W. long, are dependencies of Jamaica,* as are also Pedro and Morant Cays (two guano islands in 17° N. lat.), and the Turks and Caicos Islands.†

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,692,480 acres, from which may be deducted 80,000 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,612,480 acres available for cultivation. Of this 1,021,975 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1917-18. The dependencies have an area of 89 miles.

History.

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Xaymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, the Governor of Hispaniola. It was raided by Sir Anthony Shirley in 1596-7, and by Colonel Jackson in 1643, but it remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admiral Penn and General Venables against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 11th May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II, who appointed General Edward Doley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. Part of this town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston which then consisted of a few sheds, soon rose into a place of importance. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of African slaves left by the Spaniards, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received £6,161,927, of the 20,000,000£ granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A serious rebellion among the black population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled. In January, 1907, Kingston was devastated by a terrible earthquake, which caused great loss of life and immense destruction of property. A Mansion House Fund was opened, and contributions poured in from all parts of the Empire for the relief of distress. A free grant of £150,000£, was voted by Parliament, and a loan of £800,000£, chiefly in aid of re-building, was authorised from the Home Exchequer. The King's House, the official residence of the Governor, was completed in 1910. Two blocks of public buildings were erected in King Street, and with the exception of part of Harbour Street the town of Kingston is now practically rebuilt.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°8' rising to 87°5' in the day time, and falling to 70°8' at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons occur generally over the whole island in May and June and again in September, October and November; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers; and in the N.E. portion of the island there is usually a rainy season at the end of the year, and light rains generally during the month of August. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches to as much as 196 inches at Fellowship and 227 inches at Moore Town, both on the northern slope of the Blue Mountain Range.

Under two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, three-fourths being pure negroes. There are about 18,000 imported coolies, and about 2,111 Chinese (in 1911). English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II. in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative
ne, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the Assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, actually introduced a Bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1851 that, by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature willingly responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1885, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five ex-officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and fourteen persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other persons as may be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of His Majesty, but the number of members is not to exceed eight. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

Local Administration.

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 14 other parishes, under Laws 13 of 1900 and 17 of 1901, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, waterworks, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population, in 1911, 57,379), Port Royal (population 1,268), Spanish Town (population 7,119), Port Antonio (population 7,074), Montego Bay (population 6,616), Falmouth (population 2,288), Port Maria (population 2,833), and Savanna la Mar (population 3,400).

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., poorhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The administration of poor relief by the Parochial Boards is controlled by a Board of Supervision. The several direct taxes received on property, horses, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted mainly to the parish in which they are collected, with the exception of a few minor items, and a tax of 8d. in every 10l. in Kingston and 1s. in every 10l. in the other parishes of the gross value of the property, which go to the credit of the general revenue of the colony.

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1917-18 was 170,484l.; their expenditure 182,862l., and their debt at the end of the year 36,213l. These figures form part of the general revenue and expenditure, as given below.

There is a Supreme Court of Judicature together with Resident Magistrate Courts and Petty Sessions of Justices of the Peace throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the courts of Petty Sessions.

An "Island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an ad valorem duty; the excise on rum (105,686l. in 1917-18) and stamps and licences. Direct taxation is levied on properties principally for parochial purposes, but a uniform rate of 1s. in every 10l. value collected for General Revenue in all the parishes except Kingston, in which it was 8d., yielded 56,978l. in 1917-18.

Police.

The Constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are on the authorised strength 20 officers (a staff officer, inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 947 sub-officers and men, and 988 district constables distributed throughout the island.

Currency and Banking.

British currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000l. The Colonial Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Royal Bank of Canada, are the only private banking establishments in the Colony. The Colonial Bank has one branch and 9 sub-branches; it had an average note circulation in 1917-18 of 66,735l. The Bank of Nova Scotia has 1 branch and 9 sub-branches, and had an average note circulation in 1917-18 of 96,000l. The Royal Bank of Canada has one branch and had an average note circulation in 1917-18 of 25,000l. There are also 2,000l. of British currency notes in circulation. British silver coins above 6d. are legal tender to any extent; coins of 6d. and less amount to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest
allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent., and in 1897 to 2½ per cent. In 1917 the rate of interest was again increased to 3 per cent. The total deposits on 31st March, 1918, was £278,647l.

**Education.**

Elementary education is provided for from public funds and, during recent years, 107 Government (undenominational) elementary schools have been established. The number of schools is 693, with 45,941 scholars in average attendance, and the grant-in-aid for 1918-19 was £66,793l.; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for women teachers which is mainly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational training college for men, and two denominational colleges for women teachers. 25 students are with the colours. By a law passed in 1892 a Board of Education was constituted. Parish and District School Boards have taken up duties delegated to them; the District School Boards manage the Government schools, some of which are held in Government buildings, others in rented buildings.

Provision was made in 1892 for the opening of Government secondary schools where required; there are two secondary schools receiving aid from public funds. Secondary education is also provided for by ten other endowed schools, under local governing bodies controlled by the Jamaica Schools Commission, and a number of private schools. A beginning has been made in providing from public funds for technical education. There are three scholarships (one for girls) tenable at English universities or elsewhere within the British Empire. One Rhodes Scholarship is annually awarded in Jamaica (temporarily suspended in 1917 owing to war conditions). The following examinations are held:—London University, Cambridge Locals, Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board, Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, Royal Drawing Society.

In the Institute of Jamaica (in Kingston) is a Public Library with 19,000 books, of which 5,000 form a West India Reference Library; a Natural History Museum; and a Jamaica History Gallery.

**Industry.**

Fruit, consisting of bananas, oranges, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges in 1917 being 5,313,800, with a value of £6,832l., and that of bananas being 2,394,574 stems, with a value of £227,478l.

The area under sugar cane in 1917-18 was 37,951 acres, and under coffee 20,280. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations. Area under banana cultivation, 67,987 acres.

The large coffee plantations are mainly on the Blue Mountain Range. Comparatively few of the large plantations remain however, and the great bulk of the coffee exported is grown by small landowners on the limestone formation, which is the principal geological area. The great fruit growing districts are in St. Mary, with Port Maria, Annotto Bay, and St. Catherine, with Kingston for its outlet. Sugar is largely grown in Westmoreland and in the district of Vere Clarendon parish, and in the seaward parts of St. James and Trelawney, where the best rum in the world is produced. The cattle-raising districts are in St. Ann's, and in Hanover and Westmoreland and the western part of St. James. The uplands of Manchester parish are rich in coffee and fruit. St. Elizabeth parish grows a large quantity of logwood and other dye woods, as well as maize and fine pasture for horses.

The cultivation of cotton has recently been undertaken. There are 43 acres now under cultivation.

The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, potable spirits and beer, and building materials. Of the total trade of the island by far the greater portion is with the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada being next in importance.

The following are the figures for 1919:

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| £       | £       |
| United Kingdom | 1,012,576 | 3,567,103 |
| United States | 3,365,274 | 1,342,776 |
| Canada   | 530,108  | 387,728  |

*See end of Introduction.*

† Every parcel post packet addressed to the United Kingdom or any of His Majesty’s Colonies or Dominions bears an extra tax of 3½d. except those which are addressed to members of His Majesty’s Navy and Army. Every incoming parcel post packet containing dutiable matter bears a tax of 3½d., which is collected from the addressee.

‡ Jamaica has joined the arrangement for exchange of parcels with the U.K. and British W. I. Colonies. (See Introduction ad fin.)
States. Messrs. Elder's and Fyffe's steamers sail frequently from Liverpool. The voyage takes 13 to 14 days. The Leyland Line Steamers (West India and Pacific Branch) leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the two cables from Cuba touch at, whence they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama. On 31st January, 1898, the Direct West India Cable Company established communication between Jamaica and Halifax via Bermuda and Turks Island.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 110 telegraph and telephone stations, is now in operation. The total mileage open is 1,065,697½ miles along roads, 173 miles P.O. lines on railway, and 1,942 along railway lines. The receipts in 1917-18 were 8,811l.

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of Saint James, a distance of 112½ miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17½ miles; and to Port Antonio by a branch line from Bogwalk, on the Ewarton branch, of 54½ miles, and by a branch line from May Pen to Chapelton, 13½ miles. The total length of line open is 197½ miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed, the Government resumed possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge, providing for interest and repayment, is 122,366l. The receipts in 1918-19 exceeded the expenditure by 645l., leaving a deficiency, after providing for the above charge, of 121,721l. There is also a line of telegraph and telephone along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 112½ miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 17½ miles; from Bogwalk to Port Antonio, 54½ miles; and from May Pen to Chapelton, 13 miles.

The island is intersected by a system of main roads, the condition of which will bear favourable comparison with those in many European countries. There are 2,229 miles of main roads, and about 4,246 miles of parochial roads.

The United Fruit Co. at present run a fortnightly coasting service by steamship, calling at the principal out-ports.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, Port Antonio, and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st March, 1917, 3 ships were built.

CAYMAN ISLANDS.

The Cayman Islands (a dependency of Jamaica) consist of three islands, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac, lying between 79° 33' and 81° 30' W. longitude, and 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. latitude. They were discovered by Columbus on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession of them soon after the conquest of Jamaica, and they were mainly colonised from that island.

Grand Cayman is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, and varies from 4 to 7 miles in breadth. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized harbours. One on the north side of the island, called the Great Sound, measures over six miles across.

The principal industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle. These turtles are brought to the island and placed in "krals," to recover and fatten before being sent to their next stage, Jamaica, from whence they are exported. Over 5,000 turtles a year are thus disposed of at an average price of £1 each.

The Island of Grand Cayman is in some parts fruitful, and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable average is traversed by cliffs, and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found in quantities. Phosphate deposits of some value exist, and were worked, but have lately been neglected.

There are two towns, Georgetown and Bodden-town, and several villages. The population of Grand Cayman numbered 4,128 at the census of 1911.

The smaller Cayman Islands, viz., Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are about 70 miles distant from Grand Cayman; they are almost entirely given up to the growth of cocoanuts. Their inhabitants numbered at the last reckoning 136 and 1,300 persons respectively.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is much larger than in most parts of the West Indies.

Fine schooners of native woods are constructed at these islands for sale and for local use, the people being first-rate shipwrights.

The Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands consists of the Justices of the Peace and elected Vestrymen, and the laws passed by this body are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming operative.

The government of the Dependency is administered by a Commissioner.

Commissioner (vacant), 300l., furnished house and fees.

THE KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," until recently known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the coast line from Umba River to the Juba River, and vast territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. It includes the Witu Protectorate, a small tract of country at the mouth of the Tana. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew on July 31st, 1893. Witu is now regarded for administrative purposes as part of Tanaland.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini, the island of the Lamu Archipelago, and an area of 10 miles round the fort of Kisimayu, these territories having been leased to Great Britain for an annual rent of 17,000l. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and henceforward the Sultan's dominions are styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 248,800 square miles.

A new scheme of Administration providing for the separate control of the native and the settled areas, has been approved, and is in process of introduction. The revised system is being adopted gradually, and on the 1st of January, 1921, the following divisions were in existence:

1. Jubaland Province (Headquarters, Kismayu), consisting of the districts of Kismayu, Serenli and Gosha.

2. Coastal Area (Headquarters, Mombasa), comprising the districts of Lamu, Tana River, Malindi, Mombasa (excluding the town and Island of Mombasa) and Vanga with the Nyika Reserve.

3. Ukamba Province (Headquarters, Nairobi), comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kiambu, Kitui, Machakos and Teita (Voil).
4. Kenya Province (Headquarters, Nyeri), including the districts of Fort Hall, Nyeri, Embu, and Meru.

5. Nyanza Province (Headquarters, Kisumu), including the districts of Kisumu (exclusive of the township itself), Lumbwa (including Sotik and Kericho areas), Nandi, North Kavirondo, and South Kavirondo.

6. Masai Reserve (Headquarters, Narok), comprising the districts of Ngong, Narok, and Mara.

7. Northern Frontier District, with Headquarters at Moyale, near the Abyssinian frontier.

8. Kamasia and Suk Reserve (Headquarters, Ravine), including the districts of Eldama Ravine (with sub-stations of Elgeyo, Marakwet, and Kabarnet). The Kachelba District continues under independent control of a District Commissioner for the present, but will be incorporated in the near future.

Each Province and the Coastal Area is under the control of a Senior Commissioner, and a similar official is stationed at Nakuru. There is an Officer-in-Charge of the Northern Frontier District; an Officer-in-Charge, Massai; and an Officer-in-Charge, Kamasia and Suk Reserves.

Resident Commissioners control the townships of Mombasa and Kisumu, as well as the settled areas of Naivasha, Trans-Nzoia, Laikipia (Headquarters, Rumuruti), Usain Gishu (Headquarters, Eldoret).

The Military authorities are administering the Turkana tribes on the north-western confines of the Colony, and also maintain a post at Sankuri in Tanaland.

The capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is also the largest centre in the territory. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year       | Population |
|------------|------------|
| 1918-1919 |            |
| Europeans  | ...        | 1,824      |
| Asiatic    | ...        | 5,941      |
| Native     | ...        | 13,800     |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 30,032, of whom about 336 are Europeans. It is situated on the Eastern side of an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, on the South-Western side of the island. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the Port. Kilindini is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa and with an ample water supply and improved harbour facilities, a scheme for which is under consideration, will be the centre of distribution for the trade of Equatorial Africa.

The two principal rivers in the North are the Tana and Juba, which flow into the Indian Ocean. They are both navigable for about 400 miles by shallow draught steamers.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 2,627,103, including 17,427 Asiatics and 5,570 Europeans. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Massai, the Somalis and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Legislation is by Ordinances made by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council, the Indian codes being followed as far as applicable. The High Court is situated at Mombasa, and sessions are held at Nairobi, Naivasha, Kisumu and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the East Africa Protectorate.

Climate.

The Lowlands, or districts near the coast, are fairly healthy for the tropics. The hot season is from January to April. The Highlands, or central plateaux, have a temperate climate, the mean average temperature at noon is 78° F. July, August and September are usually cold months.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at 1s. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new local currency in coin and notes. The new coins will be florins, and pieces of 50 cents, or 1s., and 25 cents., and the notes will be for 1 florin and upwards. For a limited period the old currency will be legal tender but will eventually be replaced by the new. The nickel coins (10, 5 and 1 cents.) remain unaltered.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Chief of Customs at Mombasa as Currency Officer with the Treasury Officer as Assistant.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26 Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of British East Africa, with branches in the Protectorate at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu, Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, and Eldoret in the Usain Gishu Plateau.

The National Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (Head Office:—Pretoria) have branches at Mombasa and Nairobi.

Products and Trade.

The agricultural products of the lowlands are cocoa-nuts, rice, maize, and various native grains; cotton, sisal, sugar cane and tobacco are also cultivated. Experiments with a view to a large extension of cotton growing are being made, and the introduction of other seeds and plants of economic value is being tried. In the highlands potatoes, fruit and vegetables, maize, sim sim and beans grow freely, and are now exported; coffee, sisal, flax, sugar cane, wheat and barley are successfully cultivated, and on an increasing scale. On the uplands extensive pasture grounds are available for cattle, sheep and ostriches. The export of wool is steadily increasing. The grading of native with imported stock has made great advancement.
The forest products of the coast are gumcopal and timber. Mangroves grow on the coast, acacia and ebony in the scrub forests further inland. The highland forests contain croton, olive, fig and several good timber trees. Several large areas of fibre-bearing land have been leased near Voi and Kilwezi for the purpose of developing the Sansevieria fibre, which is indigenous. Sisal and rubber are being extensively planted.

In recent years land has been disposed of as follows:

| Year | Freehold acres | Leasehold acres | Total acres | Agriculture acres | Grazing acres | Fibre acres | Fuel acres | Forest acres |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|

Communications.

The vessels of the British India Steam Navigation Company under four weekly mail contract tranship passengers and mails to the P. & O. at Aden; also a steamer from London once a month runs as far as Zanzibar and back to London; the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes call monthly.

From the beginning of 1910 the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company extended their sailings to Mombasa; these sailings have not yet been resumed at regular intervals from and to England via Marseilles. At the end of the year 1913-14 the Union-Castle Steam Ship Company greatly improved their service to the East Coast of Africa, including Kilindini, via the Suez Canal by the
addition of two very fine steamers of 11,500 tons each, designed and fitted with the utmost regard to the comfort of passengers; this service was discontinued during the war and has not yet been resumed. The Societa Annonna Nazionale run a four-weekly service between Genoa and Mombasa calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland. Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to an Indian firm.

The Clan Ellerman and Harrison line has a four-weekly cargoship from Liverpool as far as Beira.

Owing to the war all the above arrangements are subject to variation.

The Uganda (Mombasa-Victoria) Railway was worked as a State Railway of the Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April it should be controlled by a Central Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Colony (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes. Its length is 618 miles, with a gauge of one metre. The construction cost, including steamers, etc., to March 31st, 1920, was £7,000,406. Nine steamers on the Lake are also worked in connection with the railway. During 1919-20 (exclusive of railway material) 233,844 tons of goods, and 558,079 passengers were carried.

1919-20.

Revenue: £592,391
Expenditure: £529,809

Plans are under consideration for the construction of a railway from Nakuru, at mile 448 on the Uganda Railway, to Soi (137 miles), and of a quay at Ras Kilindini.

The Post Office of the Protectorate (inclusive of the Uganda Post Office, which is worked by the Protectorate Post Office) received and despatched in 1919-20, 7,672,959 letters, packets, etc., and 433,187 telegrams.

The telegraph system has 3,518 miles of wire (exclusive of Uganda). The lines connect Mombasa with Lamu (200 miles), with Kisumu (587 miles), and Kilindini (2 miles), Kisumu with Entebbe (281 miles) (75 miles double line in East Africa and rest in Uganda), Londiani with Eldama Ravine (22 miles), Lumbwa with Kericho (17½ miles), Nairobi with Nyeri, West Kenia, Meru and Archers Post (204 miles), Kibigori with Nandi, Eldoret, and Sergoit, and Eldoret and Soy (79 miles), Mazeras and Rabai (2 miles), Magadi Junction with Machakos (16½ miles), Kisimayu, Gobwen, and Yonte (17½ miles), Magadi Railway (90 miles), Nairobi-Kiamulu (10 miles), Elmenteita-Narok (58 miles), and Kisumu-Kisisi (65 miles). A cable connects Mombasa with Zanzibar.

Telegraph communication exists between East Africa and the late German East Africa by means of telegraph lines between Voi on the Uganda Railway and Taveta.
