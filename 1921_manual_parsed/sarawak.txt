SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 600,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 500 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Barum River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1884 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1904. The present Rajah, H.H. Charles Vyner Brooke (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Heir presumptive, Bertram Brooke (H.H. the Tuan Muda), born 8th August, 1876.

The cultivation of sago is one of the most important industries. All these articles figure in the list of exports, which also includes diamonds, quicksilver, gutta-percha, indiarubber, canes, rattans, camphor, beeswax, birds' nests, tapioca, gambier, and silver. The value of the principal exports was:

*Note.—Jelutong gutta is the sap of a fairly common jungle tree. It is said to be shipped mostly to America, and used in the manufacture of paint.

--The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33' 10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses a hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 300 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

The S.P.G., and Roman Catholic Mission have stations at various other places all over the Country.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Muka River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, Kapit, Baram Simanggang, Sadong, Trusan, Limbang, Lawas, Matu, Sarebas, Kalaka, Lundu, Miri.

Communications.

Vessels of the Sarawak Steamship Company Limited provide a service every 10 days between
Kuching and Singapore; and a coasting service is maintained by that Company and by the Government.

There are roads only around the capital and thence to the mining district in Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles). To open up country in the vicinity of the capital where communication by water is not available about 10 miles of railway has been constructed and is open for traffic, and a further 10 miles is in course of construction to be increased gradually hereafter; otherwise, internal communication is entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.

Posts and Telegraphs.

Sarawak joined the Postal Union on 1st July, 1897.

Local.—To any place in the country, 4 cents per 2 oz., and 4 cents to Singapore. Inland postcards 2 cents.

Foreign.—The same as from Singapore (Sarawak stamps).

Since 1st July, 1897, letters come in direct bag from London, but via Singapore.

Wireless installations have been erected at Kuching, Sadong, Sibu, and Miri, which are in communication with Singapore.

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POSSESSIONS.

ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47'
N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the
Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast.
The Settlement (the total area of which, exclusive
of Perim, is 75 square miles) consists of two old
craters forming rocky peninsulas:—Aden proper
(area 21 square miles) on the south, and Little
Aden (area 15 square miles) on the west—and a
flat strip of coast, about three miles broad and
known as Shaikh Othman (area 39 square miles).
The peninsulas form the horns of a bay called
Aden Back Bay, which is about eight miles broad
from east to west and about four miles deep. Its
entrance is about three miles across. The native
town of Aden is situated on the east of the Aden
peninsula, opposite a gap in the crater walls. On
the west side of the peninsula, some four miles
from the town, is Steamer Point, off which the
large steamers lie. The highest point of the
peninsula is 1,776 feet above sea level. The
average annual rainfall is about 3 inches, and the
maximum is about 8 inches. The climate is very
hot, especially during the summer months. Aden
is an important coaling station, and also an
entrepôt for the trade with Arabia. The exports
consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton
goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc. The population
is about 45,000, of whom about 35,000 live in
Aden peninsula. The settlement has hitherto
been subject to the Government of Bombay, being
presided over by a Resident, who is also
commander of the troops in the garrison.

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native
kings, became subject in succession to the Abys-
sinians and Persians. In 1538 it was captured by
the Turks, who lost it some years later, but
captured it again in 1551 and held it until they
were expelled from the Yemen in 1630. The Aden
peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and
in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase.
The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was
secured by purchases in 1882 and 1888.

The Aden Protectorate, to the north and north-
east of Aden, has an area of about 9,000 square
miles and a population of over 100,000.

PERIM, a bare rocky island, five square miles in
area, with a population of about 1,200, lies in the
Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, about 1½ miles from the
south-west corner of Arabia. It possesses a good
harbour on the south-west side, with an entrance
860 yards in breadth. It was occupied by the
British in 1799, but subsequently abandoned, and
was only re-occupied in 1857, when the overland
route to India made the position important. It is
a coaling and cable station, and forms part of the
Settlement of Aden.

SOCOTRA, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E.
of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 19'—12° 42' N. lat., and
53° 21'—53° 30' E. long, and lying in the direct route
to India, has been since 1876 under the Govern-
ment of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the
Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belonged. It is
famous for its aloes. The population of the island
is about 12,000. It is rather less than 100 miles
from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its
interior is mountainous. It was formally placed
under British protection by agreement with the
Sultan in October, 1886, together with the neigh-
bouring Abdal Kute and Bromers Islands.

ASCENSION.

The island of Ascension, 34 miles in area,
lying in the South Atlantic, lat. 7° 53' S. and
long. 14° 18' W., is under the supervision of the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who main-
tain a small naval station there. It was taken
possession of in 1815, and is now garrisoned
by marines. It is famous for its turtles, large
numbers of which are caught between December
and May. It is connected by telegraph with St.
Vincent, St. Helena, and Sierra Leone. It is a
barren, rocky peak of purely volcanic origin, and
destitute of vegetation, except at the highest
point, 2,870 feet high, but has been cultivated to
an extent permitting the maintenance of 3,000
sheep. All expenses are charged to naval funds.
TRISTAN DA CUNHA.

Tristan da Cunha is the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6' S. long., 12° 2' W. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. Upon his death the garrison was withdrawn, with the exception of three men, who, with certain shipwrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement. For a long time only one of the settlers had a wife, but subsequently the others contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. The population is about 100. The inhabitants practically enjoy their possessions in common, and there is no strong drink on the island, and no crime. It was at one time proposed to give them laws and a regular government, but this was found unnecessary for the above reasons, and they remain under the moral rule of their oldest inhabitant.

The inhabitants are spoken of as long-lived, healthy, moral, religious, and hospitable to strangers. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a man-of-war in 1886, nearly all the able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885.

In the way of live stock, the inhabitants have between them about 400 head of cattle, about 700 sheep, about 50 pigs, and an abundance of poultry. Potatoes do well, and a good crop is got annually. Apple trees and peach trees are in fair number, and bear well; there are also a few fig trees, but they do not fruit. The tree of the island, which apparently is a juniper, and upon which the islanders are dependent for their wood for fuel, is getting scarce in the neighbourhood of settlement, but is abundant further off, and there is no fear of supply failing.

In January, 1904, the island was visited by H.M.S. "Odin" in order to ascertain whether the islanders would accept the offer of the Cape Government to settle them in the Cape Colony, but out of eleven families only three families elected to go. The islanders are liable from time to time to privations. In March, 1907, owing to information indicating probability of failure of supplies, relief was sent by His Majesty's Government by the "Greyhound," chartered at Cape Town. On this occasion also the inhabitants were unwilling to leave the island, and the Rev. J. G. Barrow, a clergyman who had gone to the island in April, 1906, reported that though there is sure to be privation from time to time, it does not cause absolute distress. (See correspondence presented to Parliament in Cd. 3098 and Cd. 3764.) January, February, and March are the best months for visiting the island. It is in these months that weather at times becomes so settled that the islanders are able to make visits to Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands, which are some 25 miles off. They also are often able to visit these islands in November.

MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants, but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection, or for coconut planting. The rents are paid into the Exchequer. Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island and Cato Island (in the Norfolk Island Group), Sombrero (West Indies, with a Board of Trade Lighthouse costing £200 annually), Raine Island, Bell Cay and Bramble Cay (near British New Guinea), Caroline Island, Flint Island and Vostoc Island, (Pacific Ocean, 9° 56' S. lat., 150° 6' W. long., and 11° 26' S. lat., and 151° 48' W. long.), Malden Island (4° 1' S. lat., 155° 57' W. long.), leased to Messrs. Grice, Sumner, and Co., and Starbuck Island; also Gough, Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands (in the S. Atlantic), and there are many others.

The Great and Little Basses and Minicoy are small islets in the Indian Ocean, with lighthouses maintained by the Board of Trade out of shipping dues levied on vessels passing, and collected at Ceylon, Mauritius, Straits, and Indian ports.

The Kuria-Muria Islands, five in number, off the south-east coast of Arabia, were ceded by the Imam of Muskat for the purpose of landing the Red Sea telegraph cable.

Amboyna Cay and Sprattley Island (lat. 8° 38' N., 111° 54' E. long.; lat. 7° 52' N., 112° 53' E. long.), two uninhabited sandbanks in the middle of the China Sea, lying about 240 miles N.W. of Borneo and 100 miles N. of Labuan, were annexed in 1877, and leased for guano collection. They are annually visited by Chinese junks for the purpose of collecting turtle.
