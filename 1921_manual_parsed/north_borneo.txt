**NORTH BORNEO.**

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. The headquarters of administration are at Jesselton. Other stations are at Labuk, Kotabulud, Tuaran, Tambunan, Kaningau, Tenom, Beaufort, Pensiangan, Lamag, Papar, Putatan, Ranau, Timbang Batu, Semporna Mempakul, Sipitong and Rundum.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, coconuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The mineral resources of the country are now being fully investigated. Gold has been found in three of the rivers on the east coast; coal, manganese, and other minerals have also been met with, and are being worked.

The country is mountainous. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who according to the Census taken in 1911 number about 216,000, are mainly Bruneis, Ibanuns, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade; further back, the Dusuns cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields; and in the interior they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt,
clearing fresh jungle every year; the Muruts, another interior tribe, are very numerous and peaceable, occasionally varying more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting raids on a petty scale. There are Chinese settlements on the coast; they cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. There are 400 Europeans and 30,000 Chinese in the territory. Sandakan, the chief town, with suburbs, has a population of 12,000. There are two missions, one the Church of England, with stations at Kudat and Jesselton and Beaufort, and one Roman Catholic, with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast. The former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton. The Basel Mission also has schools at Kudat, Beaufort and Papar, and at Sandakan and Tenom.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (now Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 120 inches, according to situation.

Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce, and much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco and rubber, for which the soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited. The value of tobacco exported in 1912 was $2,264,378; in 1913, $2,919,970; in 1914, $1,913,366; in 1915, $2,342,758; in 1916, $1,519,155; in 1917, $172,603; and in 1918, $42,140; of estate rubber, 1912, $879,207; 1913, $1,768,183; 1914, $1,615,461; 1915, $2,348,754; 1916, $4,327,195; 1917, $634,564; and in 1918, $670,236; and of timber, 1912, $727,083; 1913, $869,463; 1914, $863,666; 1915, $831,465; 1916, $774,944; 1917, $43,795; and in 1918, $41,702. Coconut plantations are rapidly increasing in number, and the export of coconuts and of copra is becoming of importance. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper and tea. There is a large and increasing export of plantation rubber. The enormous virgin forests of North Borneo have enabled a lucrative timber trade to be carried on with China and Manila, and inquiries for railway sleepers are now coming from various parts of the world. Sleepers have already been supplied to Manila, and it is certain that this trade can be largely developed. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay, where two large saw mills have been working for some years. A slipway carrying vessels up to 150 feet in length or a dead weight of 600 tons has been constructed. The Cutch factory is doing a considerable business, and another factory has been established in Marudu Bay. An electric light and Power Company has been established at Sandakan.

An electric light and cold storage company has been established at Jesselton, which port is rapidly growing in size and importance. Large development works have been undertaken by the Government at Jesselton, and are now completed. The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rotan, firewood, salt fish, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, cutch, etc., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, stamps, and royalties, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites.

Minerals.

Excellent coal is being worked by the Cowie Harbour Coal Company, and coal is being supplied to vessels at the principal North Borneo ports. It is also rapidly becoming of importance as a coaling station for ocean liners.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. A syndicate has recently been formed for the working of the oil belts which have been discovered on the West Coast.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent. pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent. and 5 cent. pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the chartered
Bank of India, Australia and China, the Chinese Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Tiwan. A State Bank is in process of formation.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

**Constitution.**

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are 10 provinces divided into five Residencies (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, Myburgh, and Clarke).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British Colonies, and an Imam's court, for the administration of Mohammedan law, with native courts for trials by local customs. There is a force of about 850 armed police under European officers.

**Means of Communication.**

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers once a week between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan, and a local company runs a line along the coast and to adjacent islands. The Government have constructed a metre-gauge railway from Brunei Bay to Beaufort, 20 miles, and from Beaufort to Jesselton, 57 miles, and a line of 33 miles from Beaufort to Tenom, which will open up the interior. In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 120 miles. The principal coastal terminus is Jesselton, at which port there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. Over 600 miles of telegraph line are open, and wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau. Several riding roads already exist, and over 400 miles of bridle path have been constructed. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about twenty-six days. Postage to all British possessions for letters 4 cents per oz.; foreign countries, 10 cents. per \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz.

On the completion of the Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau-Sebatik. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Lamag and Lahad Datu from Sandakan, and Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan and Kudat.
