TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Tanganyika Territory consists of that portion of the former Colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I, of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the Colony, namely the districts of Ruanda and Urundi in the North-West, and the Kionga Area, South of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. The Territory extends from the Unha River on the North to the Rovuma River on the South, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands. The Northern Boundary runs approximately North-West to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of southern latitude with the eastern shore (Mohuru Point). The boundary on the west starts at a point where the frontier between the Uganda Protectorate and ex-German East Africa cuts the River Mavumba, and follows roughly the eastern boundary of the former districts of Ruanda and Urundi to Lake Tanganyika. The western boundary then follows the middle of Lake Tanganyika to its southern end at Kasanga (formerly Blanckburg), whence it
goes south-east to the northern end of Lake Nyasa. Rather less than half-way down the lake the boundary turns east and joins the Rovuma River, whose course it follows to the sea. The total area is about 365,000 square miles.

**General Description.**

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,590 feet; Nyasa, 1,607 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 20,000) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa and Lindi. The most important inland town is Tabora, which has a population of 25,000, and is situated at the junction of the main caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mahenge, Liwale and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway, Ujiji and Kasanga, on Tanganyika; and Mwaya, on Nyasa.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilima Njaro, which rises to 19,720 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,960 feet). In the south-west are the Livingstone Mountains, where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz.: the southern portion of Lake Victoria, the eastern shores of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika, and the northern and north-eastern shores of Lake Nyasa. There are four smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

**Climate.**

Generally speaking the rainfall is low for a tropical country and in some years there are great droughts. There are three types of climate. (1) The Indian or trade wind type, which prevails over the greater part. It has one rainy season, from December to April. The hottest period is in November. (2) The monsoon type, prevailing in the N.E. There are two rainy seasons, the heaviest being from March to May and the lesser in November. The hottest month is February. (3) The equatorial type prevailing in the N.W. It has two warmer and two cooler seasons, the warmer being October and February-March (i.e., when the sun is above the Equator), and the cooler July and November-December. The rainy season is October-May (Nyanza) or November-April (Tanganyika). The average yearly temperature in the coast region is 78° F.

**History.**

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made twelve treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut.-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilima Njaro and occupied Moshi on March 13th of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's Forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on January 1st, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in January, 1919, appointing an Administrator. The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on September 25th, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council.

In December, 1920, draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium. The draft mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain laid down conditions directed against slavery, forced labour, except for essential public works and services, abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It is provided that nationals of States members of the League of Nations are to have complete commercial equality. An annual report is to be made to the Council of the League.

**Population.**

The number of Europeans in Tanganyika Territory is approximately 2,200. There are also over 10,000 Indians, 4,000 Arabs and 1,000 Goans. The natives are estimated at 4,900,000, whilst the population of Ruanda and Urundi, administered by Belgium, is about 3,500,000. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Masai and other Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important people are the Swahili, who are hybrids between Arabs or Persians and all sorts of African blood. Their language is more or less spoken as a lingua franca from Aden in the north to Durban in the south, and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but there are about 300,000 Mahommmedans in the coast area and immediate hinterland.

European Missions have done a good deal for the natives in education and medicine. All the German Missions have been closed, and have been, or are about to be, handed over to British or Allied Societies.

**Products and Trade.**

| Year    | Imports       | Domestic Exports | Re-exports |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| 1917-18 | Rs.16,642,895 | Rs.8,970,434     | Rs.543,923 |
| 1918-19 | Rs.116,697    | Rs.10,114,306    | Rs.393,261 |
| 1919-20 | Rs.17,376,405 | Rs.19,940,156    | Rs.1,445,912 |
These figures do not include the following items: — Cotton (Rs. 555,654) and Sisal (Rs. 3,701,900) exported by the Custodian of Enemy Property, and Mica (approximately Rs. 600,000) for the Ministry of Munitions.

The chief articles of export are sisal, cotton, hides, skins, copra, coffee, groundnuts, ghee, grain, beeswax and sesame. The rubber industry has been a complete failure, and one sees in the neighbourhood of both railways vast forests of ceara rubber trees which, so far as can be ascertained, are quite useless. Mica is the chief product and is of good quality. Coal and gold have also been found, but not in paying quantities.

Communications.

The territory is served by two railways of one metre gauge, the Central Railway from Dar-es-Salaam to Kigoma (780 miles) and the Tanga Railway from Tanga to Moshi at the foot of Kilima Njaro (222 miles), with a temporary line from Kahe (20 kilometres east of Moshi) linking up with the Uganda Railway at Voi. A portion of the Central Railway is still under Belgian control. Motor transport is at present possible only on a few good roads, but the expansion of trade will in course of time necessitate the construction of roads suitable for motor traffic and the establishment of motor transport services to act as feeders to the railways.

The ports of Lake Victoria are served by the steamers of the Uganda Marine; those on Lake Nyasa by the Nyassaland Government steamers; and a Belgian service, together with a small steamer belonging to the British Government, maintains communications on Lake Tanganyika.

Currency and Banking.

The German Government and the German East Africa Company issued local rupees of the Indian standard, and subsidiary coins, which are still legal tender. But the German notes are not accepted.

Provision has now been made for the coining of a British East African currency (florin and subsidiary coins) at the rate of ten florins to the pound sterling. One florin notes are already in circulation in Tanganyika Territory.

The banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa and National Bank of South Africa, and the Banque du Congo Belge.
