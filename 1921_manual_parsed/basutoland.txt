BASUTOLAND.

Situation and Description.

Basutoland forms an irregular oval within the Union of South Africa; the main axis, about 150 miles in length, lying in a north-easterly direction. The Orange Free State Province, Natal and the Cape Province form its boundaries. Its area is 11,716 square miles, or nearly as large as Belgium.

It lies between 29 and 30 degrees south lat., and between 27 and 28 degrees east long.

A portion of the great Drakensberg range of mountains forms the eastern boundary of Basutoland. Peaks in this range rise to heights of eleven and twelve thousand feet. Westward the country is occupied by the Malutis, mountains inferior in height to the Drakensberg. They form a jumbled mass so closely packed that the valleys are of the narrowest, and there is little ground which can be cultivated. It is only along the Western border that mountains give place to hills and the cultivation of larger portions of land becomes possible.

In favourable seasons the territory produces large crops of wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. It also produces large numbers of cattle, horses, and sheep. The range of temperature is approximately from a maximum of 93° F. to a minimum of 11° F. The average rainfall is 30 inches.

The climate is good for Europeans and natives alike. Its high altitude and pure atmosphere prove most invigorating. Phthisis pulmonalis is little known except among Europeans who have come to the country on account of their disease. The latter in early stages of the disease improve at once. Persons suffering from malarial fever or its results are benefited greatly by a short residence in Basutoland. Leprosy imported from the Orange River Colony and Cape Colony has now a firm hold in the country, the proportion being about 91 per 1,000. As yet it has been possible to do little to check the spread of the disease. With the authority of H.E. the High Commissioner, a Leper Settlement was formed in 1912, about 4 miles from Maseru for the segregation and care of all lepers within the Territory.

Population and Industry.

In 1875 when Basutoland formed part of the Cape Colony, at the general census of the Colony taken in that year, the European population of Basutoland was 499, and the native 127,707. At the census of 1901 the population was estimated at 647 Europeans and 263,400 natives.

| Census, 1911. |
|---------------|
| Natives       | 403,111 |
| Whites        | 1,396   |
| Total         | 404,507 |

Maseru, the capital, and largest town, has a population of approximately 900 natives and 500 whites.

The productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron, and coal has been found and used in some parts by natives in small quantities.

History.

The Basutos appear to have been composed of the remnants of several tribes which were broken up in the wars waged by Moselikatze, the king of the Matabele, in the early years of the last century. These remnants were united in about 1818 under Mosesh, a chief of great ability, who ruled for many years.

In 1852 war broke out between Mosesh and the British Government; the Basutos were defeated by Sir G. Cathcart at the battle of the Berea Mountain, and Mosesh sent in his submission, and made peace.

A few years later, in 1856, disputes arose between Mosesh and the Orange Free State respecting boundary questions, and hostilities resulted which lasted from 1856 to 1858, with indecisive results, and were concluded by the Treaty of Aliwal, 1858, but collisions frequently recurred.

In 1865 the war broke out afresh, and Mosesh again claimed the protection of the Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse. He declined to interpose actively, but despatched a British Commissioner to Thaba Bosigo, the capital of Basutoland, to settle the difficulties. This measure met with little success, and in the end the Boers were successful, and Mosesh sued for peace. At the treaty of Thaba Bosigo, April, 1866, he recognised the permanent cession of a portion of his district and acknowledged himself a subject of the Orange Free State.

The peace was of short duration, the war was renewed, and the Basutos, pressed by the Boers, were on the brink of destruction, when they again appealed to be taken under the authority of the Queen, and in January, 1868, Sir Philip Wodehouse received authority to recognise Mosesh and his tribe as British subjects, and for the incorporation of their territory. This was carried into effect by a proclamation dated March 12th, 1868.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition, until it was annexed to the Cape, by an Act of the Cape Legislature, No. 12 of 1871. The Act expressly declared that Basutoland was not to be subject to the general law of the Colony, and gave the Governor power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend to it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein.

The subsequent history of Basutoland was one of much trouble and disturbance.

In March, 1879, Moirosi, the chief of the Quithing district, in the south-east of Basutoland, rescued from justice his son Doda, who had been arrested for horse-stealing; and, on the Colonial authorities demanding his surrender, broke out into open defiance of its authority. Owing to the great natural strength of his country and stronghold, considerable difficulty was experienced in subduing him; but in December of that year his stronghold was carried by storm, and he himself fell in the assault. The proposals of the Colonial Government to divide the territory occupied by the adherents of this chief into lots for occupation by European settlers gave rise to great discontent among the Basutos who had remained loyal. This discontent was further increased by the extension...
of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, providing for a general disarmament, to Basutoland by proclamation in April, 1880, and culminated in the revolt of almost the whole tribe when an attempt was made to put the Act in force. The rebellion spread to the native territories east and south of Basutoland, East Griqualand, Tampookieland, and the Pandomisi, where the rising was signalised by the treacherous murder of Mr. Hope, the magistrate, and other Europeans.

Strenuous efforts were made by the Colony to reduce the Basutos to submission by force of arms, but without decisive success, though the loss of their cattle, and the interruption of cultivation, caused great distress amongst them. Early in 1881 overtures for an arrangement were made by the leading chiefs, and, at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, the High Commissioner acted as arbiter between the Colonial Government and the Basutos.

The terms of his award were, the registration of arms, the payment of compensation to those natives who had remained loyal by the tribe, and also the payment of a fine of 5,000 head of cattle. The award, was accepted by the Basutos and the fine paid, but little was done towards fulfilling the other conditions. The Colonial Ministry, with a view to facilitate a settlement, cancelled the award and induced the Cape Parliament to assume the burden of compensating the loyalists. The Disarmament Proclamation was also repealed, and at a Pitso held on the 24th of April, 1883, a very liberal constitution was offered to the Basutos. Masupha, however, the chief of the Berea district, with several other chiefs of influence, held aloof, and practically declared their intention to have no further connection with the Colonial Government, and the tribe generally were understood to wish to be under the direct authority of the Imperial Government. In the meantime a strong feeling in favour of the entire abandonment of Basutoland had grown up in the Colony, and on the request of the Colonial Ministry the Imperial Government decided to undertake for a time the administration of the country on condition that satisfactory evidence was given by the Basutos of their desire to remain under the British Crown, that the Orange Free State should undertake to cause the frontier to be respected by its subjects, and that the Colony should pay over towards the cost of administration the Customs duties received on goods imported into Basutoland. This offer was accepted by the Colony, and provision was made in the Basutoland Disannexation Act of 1883 for the payment of 20,000£ a year, and the Free State also intimated its willingness to comply with the conditions so far as it was concerned.

A great national Pitso of the Basutos was held on the 29th of November, 1883, attended by the representatives of more than two-thirds of the whole tribe, who unanimously expressed their willingness to comply with the conditions on which the Imperial Government was prepared to assume the responsibility of the administration of the country. Several important chiefs who were not at the Pitso subsequently expressed their concurrence in this resolution, Masupha alone refusing to accept the offers of the Government, and desiring to remain independent. Her Majesty's Government upon this decided that their conditions were sufficiently complied with, advised the Queen to sanction the Disannexation Act, and immediately took steps for carrying on the government under the immediate authority of the Crown, from the 13th March, 1884. Masupha tendered his submission in 1886, and asked for a magistrate to be resident in his district.

**Constitution.**

The territory is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for South Africa, the latter possessing the legislative authority, which is exercised by proclamation.

The chiefs adjudicate on cases between natives, with a right of appeal to the Magistrates' Courts, where all cases between the natives and Europeans are brought.

For fiscal and other purposes the country is divided into 7 districts, namely, Maseru, Leribe, Mohale's Hoek, Berea, Mafeteng, Quthing, and Qacha's Nek. Each of the districts is subdivided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the Mosheesh family. The revenue arises from the post office, native tax, the sale of licences, and customs.

Serious crime is rare, and the drinking habits, which threatened to destroy the people, have been to a great extent abandoned owing to the influence of the missionaries, and the Government. There is not a single canteen in the country. The area under arable cultivation steadily increases, and there is less and less tendency to stock-thieving and petty warfare.

**Education.**

Excellent work is being carried on in the country by missionaries, in whose hands the labour of education is almost exclusively vested. There are 390 schools, with 30,000 scholars, a very large proportion being in the schools of the French Protestant Mission. There are seven small European schools with 133 pupils. There is also a Government Industrial School for natives at Maseru, with 62 pupils on the roll.

The Education vote for 1920-21 was £25,404.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no navigable waterways, the rivers being low in winter and flooded generally in summer. The usual mode of conveyance is by ox-waggon or light cart.

The roads in the country are now in good condition for any kind of transport, but the periodical rains draining down from the high watersheds seriously damage them. Bridges have been constructed across the Hlotse river, the Khomokhoana river, the Caledon river at Ficksburg and Peka and the Little Caledon river near Maseru. A road and railway bridge has been built across the Caledon river at Maseru. New bridges have been made across the Phutiatsana river near Teyateyaneng and the Mekhaleng river near Mohale's Hoek, and over the Tsoaeing and Tlametlu streams in Maseru district. There are no railways through the country, but in December, 1905, the Central South African Railways opened a branch line running from Marseilles station on their Bloemfontein-Modderpoort line to a point just within the Basutoland border, and close to Maseru.

The line of postal communication is through the Cape Province and Orange Free State Province. Letters to and from Europe take about 20 days, to Cape Town 3 days. Postal rates are similar to those of the Union Post Office. Savings bank...
facilities and a money order system have been extended to Basutoland. The telegraph stations are Hlotse Heights, Teyateyaneng, Maseru, Morija, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek, Quthing, and Qacha's Nek; while a Government telephone line runs throughout the country to all Government stations. Qacha's Nek is connected with Matatiele in the Cape Province by telephone.

Trade.

The imports consist chiefly of blankets, ploughs, saddlery, clothing, iron and tin ware, and groceries.

The exports consist chiefly of grain, cattle, wool, and horses. The commercial intercourse is almost exclusively with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State Province.

| Exports | Imports |
|---------|---------|
| £       | £       |
| 1918    | 1,007,612 | 882,339 |
| 1919    | 1,380,119 | 1,157,037 |

Basutoland from the 1st July, 1891, was admitted into a Customs Union with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State, by which arrangement a share of Customs duties collected at the ports of the Cape Province was credited to Basutoland, but retained by the Cape Government on account of the annual contribution of 18,000L Basutoland now receives, by arrangement, a proportion of Customs Revenue collected by the Union Government (see under South Africa, "Customs").

During the years 1908-20 a sum of 148,191L, representing accumulated surpluses of previous years, was spent on works of a permanent character, such as hospitals, bridges, Government offices, leper asylum, etc.

Currency and Banking.

The Standard Bank and the National Bank have opened branches in Maseru, and there are branches of Post Office Savings Bank at most of the Government Stations. The Bloemfontein Board of Executors has also opened a branch in Maseru, with a Savings Bank Department. The currency is exclusively British, but exchange, and occasionally the payment of taxes, is still largely conducted by barter.
