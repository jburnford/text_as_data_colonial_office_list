MESOPOTAMIA.

Mesopotamia, in the sense in which the name is used now, is that part of the former Ottoman Empire which stretches from Fao on the Persian Gulf to a point north of Mosul and just south of Jazirah-Bin-Umar, on the Tigris. It comprises the vilayets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul, with the exception of Amadiyah which, by the Treaty of Sévres, is left to Turkey.

The area of Mesopotamia is about 143,000 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the new Turkish frontier, which approximates to latitude 37° N. and follows the northern boundary of the vilayet of Mosul, modified so as to pass south of Amadiyah. On the east, it is bounded by Persia. The frontier, the delimitation of which was completed by a Turko-Persian Commission in 1914, runs in the north through, and in the southern portion skirts, the Kurdish mountains which form the western edge of the Persian plateau and descends 10 miles above Mohammerah to the Shatt-al-Arab, the river formed by the union of the Euphrates and the Tigris. On the south, Mesopotamia is bounded by the Persian Gulf and Kuwait; and on the south-west and west by the deserts of northern Arabia and Syria. On the north-west, the boundary between Mesopotamia and Syria was settled by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920. It runs from the Tigris at Feishkhabur to Abu Kemal on the Euphrates, and thence across the desert to Imtar, south of Jebel Druz. Apart from the hill country in the north-east, Mesopotamia mainly consists of great plains traversed by the Euphrates and the Tigris. The country between these rivers is divided into two parts. The southern portion, stretching from Baghdad to Basrah is a great alluvial plain about 35,000 square miles in area with a fertile soil wherever the land can be irrigated without being drowned. A considerable extent of it is, however, covered by marshes formed by the uncontrolled action of the rivers and canals. The northern portion known as Jazirah or “the Island,” is more undulating, and is in places broken by ranges of hills. It is fertile under irrigation in the north, but further south the plains become more arid until it passes into a hard desert tract.

The climate of Mesopotamia is of the continental sub-tropical type, with very high temperatures in summer in the plains. In July and August the mean daily maximum temperature is 104° F. at Basrah, and 110° F. at Baghdad, while in December and January the mean daily minimum temperature is 47° F. at Basra and 40° F. at Baghdad. The rainy season is from November to March. There is a rainless summer of six months lasting from about April to September. The Mosul area has a rainfall of about 13 inches a year and relies on the rain to grow its crops. The rest of the country, however, has an annual rainfall of only about seven inches, and the crops are grown, with very little help from the rain, on irrigated land.

The chief towns are Baghdad, Basrah, Mosul, Kerbela, and Nejef. The two last, situated on the edge of the Arabian desert, are pilgrim centres which attract Shias from all parts of the Mohammedan world, but especially from Persia and India.

Population.

According to a census taken in 1920 the population numbers 2,849,282, made up as follows:

|                | Sunni   | Shi'ah | Jewish | Christian | Other Religions | Total    |
|----------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Basrah Vilayet | 42,558  | 721,414| 10,088 | 2,551     | 8,989           | 785,600  |
| Baghdad Vilayet| 524,414 | 750,421| 62,565 | 20,771    | 2,133           | 1,360,304|
| Mosul Vilayet  | 579,713 | 22,180 | 14,835 | 55,470    | 31,180          | 703,378  |
| Total          | 1,146,685| 1,494,015| 87,488 | 78,792    | 42,302          | 2,849,282|

* The figures for Mosul include the population of the Kurdish area of Sulaimaniyah, viz., 155,000, of whom all but 1,100 are Sunnis.

Natural Products.

The chief articles of export from Mesopotamia before the war were dates, wool and barley. Dates and wool have continued to be exported, but the export of barley has fallen almost to nothing, mainly because of the purchases made by the British military authorities in Mesopotamia. Round Mosul the prevailing crop is wheat, but all the wheat grown is consumed in the country. Rice, in most cases “red” rice of inferior quality, is grown on the swampy lands on the Middle Euphrates, in the Amarah area on the Tigris, and to a small extent, on the Diyalah canals, near Baghdad. Rice of better quality but in very small quantities is grown in the Kurdish hills.

In the Kurdish regions round Sulaimaniyah and Rowanduz and to the north of Mosul tobacco is an important crop. The crop is hardly sufficient for local requirements. None is exported.

In the Baghdad Vilayet cotton can be grown. Experiments carried out since the occupation of Baghdad in 1917 tend to show that Mesopotamia cotton compares favourably with cotton grown in other parts of the world.
Wool is exported in considerable quantities. The principal sheep rearing districts are the Mosul area and the Kurdish hills.

There are traces of petroleum in many places round Mosul and Kerkuk and near the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanaqin.

Minor products are millet, licorice root, gall-nuts, gum and dye-root.

Railways.

The railways open to traffic are—

**Metre Gauge.**
1. From Basrah to Baghdad (about 300 miles).
2. From Kut to Baghdad (105 miles).
3. From Baghdad to Quraith on the Persian frontier (130 miles) with a branch line to Kifri (50 miles).

**Standard Gauge** (4ft. 8½in.).
4. From Baghdad to Shargat (about 200 miles).

**Narrow Gauge** (2ft. 6in.).
5. Baghdad to Falujah on the Euphrates (about 30 miles).

With the exception of about 75 miles of the Baghdad-Shargat line, which was built by the Baghdad Railway Company before the war, the whole of this railway system has been made by the British authorities during and since the war.

There is a gap of 70 miles between the Mesopotamian railhead at Shargat and Mosul; and the Baghdad Railway comes down to Nisibin, about 110 miles from Mosul. Thus railway communication between Constantinople and Basrah, via Aleppo, Mosul and Baghdad is complete except for a gap of less than 200 miles.

Government.

The war left Mesopotamia in British occupation; and by the Treaty of Sevres (10th August, 1920), Turkey renounced all sovereignty over the country. On March 2nd, 1921, the supervision of the affairs of Mesopotamia was transferred to the Colonial Office.

In Turkish times each of the three Vilayets was governed by a Vali, who received orders directly from Constantinople. The official hierarchy, in descending order of importance, was:

- **Vali** ... in charge of Vilayet.
- **Mutasarrif** ... Liwa.
- **Qaimmaqam** ... Qudha.
- **Mudir** ... Nahiyah.

As Mesopotamia came under British control, as a result of the military operations of 1914-1918, British Political Officers took over the administration of liwas and qadhas, working under the orders of the Chief Political Officer (later the Civil Commissioner). This system is now in process of reorganisation. Each Liwa is to be administered by a native Mutasarrif, who will be advised by a British Inspector. The Government of the whole country is vested in an Arab Government which acts by the advice of the British High Commissioner. Each ministry has attached to it a British Adviser.
