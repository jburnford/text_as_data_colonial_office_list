SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Sierra Leone has a coast-line of 210 miles, extending between 6° 55' and 10° of N. lat., from the territory of the Republic of Liberia on the south-east, where the Manoh River forms the boundary, as far as Kiragba on the north-west; about midway on this coast there is a block of land about 23 miles in length with a mean width of about 14 miles, forming the oldest portion of the Colony; about 42 miles south-east from this block there is another about 109 miles in length, with a varying width not definitely ascertained, forming the Sherbro District. The rest of the Colony consists of a strip of land along the sea and river shores of half a mile in depth inland from high-water mark in some places, and a quarter of a mile in others; and of the Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellaboi, Kortimo, Tasso, Macaulay, and other islets. The strip of shore-line was acquired for the purpose of securing an effective control over the importation of sea-borne goods into the main portions of the Colony.

Immediately adjoining the Colony of Sierra Leone lying to the northward and eastward is the Protectorate, the northern boundaries of which were defined by the Agreement between Great Britain and France which was concluded on the 21st January, 1896. The extreme depth from south to north is about 210 miles, lying between 7° and 10° N. lat., and the extreme breadth from east to west is 180 miles, lying between 10° 40' and 13° 21' of W. long. The estimated area of the Colony and Protectorate is 31,000 square miles.

History.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession by King Nebamba and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor, of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs, and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government," of a piece of land described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 22nd August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a party of natives of Africa, and some others, who from various circumstances had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were struggling waifs in and about London. Somewhat later the Colony was much used as a settlement for Africans rescued from slave ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves. The territory of the Colony received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on the 10th July, 1807, King Farima and King Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the Colony; and in 1861 Bai Conteh, King of Kwaia, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Kwaia country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the Treaty of Cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with the King and chiefs of Sherbro, Bagru, Sherbro Island, and some other places, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. This treaty was not ratified by the Crown, but was revived by a fresh agreement made in 1882. A number of other Treaties of Cession were made from time to time.

On August 21st, 1896, a Proclamation was issued of a Protectorate over the Hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate, which, by Order-in-Council No. 11 of 1920 is divided into three Provinces as follows:

Northern Province Districts.—Port Lokko, Karene, Bomballi and Koinadugu.
Central Province Districts.—Moyamba, Konno, Kennema and Pendembu.
Southern Province Districts.—Bonthe, Gbangbama, Sumbuya and Pujehun.
Central Province { Mendis, Sherbros, Munnuna,
a few Kinas.
Southern Province { Mendis, Krama, Sherbros,
Gallinas and Vais.

from high water mark in some places, and a quarter of a mile in others; and of the Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellaboi, Kortimo, Tasso, Macaulay, and other islets. The strip of Central Province Districts.—Koyama, Konno, Kenema and Pendembu.

Southern Province Districts.—Bonthe, Gbangbama, Sumbuya and Pujehun.
The Sherbro District (Capital, Bonthe), which comprises the Island of Sherbro and York Island, and the Headquarters District (Capital, Waterloo), which includes the Peninsula of Sierra Leone outside the Freetown area, are entirely in the Colony.

General Description.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of volcanic mountains, running parallel to the sea from N.N.W. to S.S.E., the summits of which, in the Sugar Loaf and Leicester Mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of syenite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The parts on the banks of the rivers are low and swampy, while away from the rivers the country consists of low rolling downs, with here and there a range of hills some 3,000 feet in height. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa, the country is for the most part well watered by rivers and running streams. The principal rivers which empty themselves into the Atlantic on the Sierra Leone Coast are the Great and Little Skarocies, the Sierra Leone or Rokell, the Sherbro, the Jong, the Manneh or Mano, the Ribbi, Bum, Kittam, and Moa, most of which are navigable for several miles.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 2,300 feet above the sea. In 1911 it contained 34,090 inhabitants. It possesses the best harbour in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining have a population (including Freetown and its Districts) of 75,318. It yields only a small quantity of exportable commodities. The extent of the territory is small, the generally rocky soil is not very well adapted for cultivation, and the people of the Colony seem not much attracted to that form of industry.

Considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piasava, with other articles of lesser importance are exported via Bonthe in the Southern Province.

Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, indiarubber trees and vines, bene seed, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, cocoa, rice, and other tropical products. No minerals have been discovered, except iron, which can hardly be reckoned as of exportable value.

The population of the Protectorate was in 1911 estimated at 1,327,560 and is composed of the following tribes:

Northern Province { Temnes, Limbas, Susus, Lokkos, Foulahs, Mandingoes, Korankos, Yalunkas,
Central Province { Mendis, Sherbros, Konnohs, a few Kissis.
Southern Province { Mendis, Krima, Sherbros, Gallinas and Vais.

Constitution.

A Charter, issued on May 27th, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, established a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, revoked so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter, dated 17th of December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. According to the same letters patent, the Governor of Sierra Leone is aided by an Executive Council composed of four officials and the officer in command of the troops. The Legislative Council, of which the Governor is ex-officio president, is composed of the members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Comptroller of Customs as ex-officio members, together with the Senior District Commissioner, not ex-officio, and the Principal Medical Officer as official members, and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On March 7, 1913, an Imperial Order-in-Council was issued providing for the administration of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The Order applies to the territories, not being portions of the Colony of Sierra Leone, lying between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude and the tenth and fourteenth degrees of west longitude, and beginning at the extreme southerly point of the Colony on the Anglo-Liberian boundary, as delimited under the provisions of the Anglo-Liberian Convention, November 11, 1885, and January 21, 1911.

The Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of Sierra Leone is also the Governor of the Protectorate. Authority is given to the Governor by Ordinances passed in the Legislative Council to exercise and provide for giving effect to the powers and jurisdiction acquired by the Crown in Sierra Leone.

Fresh Letters Patent and Governor's Instructions dated the 3rd April, 1913, were also promulgated and proclaimed during that year.

Climate.

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The shade temperature varies during the year from about 62° to 89°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur at the commencement and close of the rainy season. They are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp,
The rainfall in Freetown for the year 1917 was 131 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from N.E. to S.E.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is unhealthy, and malarial fever is prevalent. The general death-rate for Freetown was 33 per thousand in 1917. A large proportion of this is due to a heavy infantile mortality.

It is estimated that there were 1,090 Europeans in the Colony in 1917, among whom there were 10 deaths.

Natives of West Africa suffer considerably from malarial fever, but the type is not so severe as among Europeans. Yellow fever is believed to be endemic.

**Vegetable Products.**

The principal products exported from Sierra Leone are palm kernels, palm oil, bene seed (sesamum), ground nuts, kola nuts, ginger and hides. The chief agricultural work lies in the cultivation of rice and cassava for local consumption. The kola tree is found near almost every village, and from its product a considerable portion of the revenue of the native inhabitants is derived. Gum copal is also produced, but its exportation has been prohibited for five years from the 30th of September, 1913.

**Trade.**

There are practically no industries at present. The inhabitants of Freetown and the Colony generally are traders and shop-keepers, and do little in the way of agriculture beyond the planting of cassava. In the Protectorate the inhabitant plant "farms," chiefly of rice and cassava, and collect natural products for sale to the various merchants and traders of the Colony. The staple food of the inhabitants is rice and foofoo made from cassava.

The products from the Protectorate which constitute the principal exports are palm kernels, palm oil, bene seed, ground nuts, hides and ginger. Cotton has for many years been cultivated by the natives, some of whom manufacture a considerable number of native clothes. The British Cotton Growing Association made an experiment in cotton growing on European principles, which was not successful, chiefly owing to the withering effect of the harmattan wind. The principal imports are spirits, tobacco, cotton goods, furniture, groceries, etc., and hardware.

**Currency and Banking.**

Besides English currency, 5 franc pieces of the Latin union are legal tender, and West Africa silver coins (2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d.) were put into circulation in 1913, and alloy coins of similar denominations in 1920. Currency Notes of the value of 20s. and 10s. were introduced in 1916 and of 2s. in 1917, and 1s. in 1919. The Bank of British West Africa has two branches in the Colony and some agencies in the Protectorate. The Colonial Bank also is established in Freetown. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882, and had invested by the end of 1919, the sum of 96,114£.

**Education.**

There are 163 elementary and intermediate mission schools in the Colony and Protectorate, of which 115 are assisted by the Government. At the end of 1919 the enrolment number was 9,266. There are 4 assisted Industrial or Trades Schools conducted by the Roman Catholic Mission; the total enrolment number was 265. Education is not compulsory. There are 10 secondary schools in the Colony, 3 of which are assisted by the Government, the total enrolment being 1,200. The Church Missionary Society has a college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University. A scheme for the education, on Western lines, of Mohammedan children was started in 1901. There are now five Mohammedan Schools or Madrasas in Freetown supported by the Government, with 655 pupils on the roll in 1919. A Government school for the sons and nominees of native chiefs was established at Bo in the Railway District of the Protectorate on 1st March, 1906, under European supervision. The number of pupils at the close of the year 1918 was 130. There is also a Government Model School in Freetown at which over 325 pupils at present attend.

An agricultural training college for vernacular teachers has now been established at Njala in the Protectorate; 60 pupils have already been enrolled. There are also two Anglo-vernacular schools at Bailima and Gbamgama in the Ronietta and Northern Sherbro Districts respectively, with an attendance of 80 pupils.

The total number of children being instructed in the Colony and Protectorate was as follows:

| Type of School                  | Number of Pupils |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Elementary and Intermediate     | 9,266            |
| Secondary Schools               | 1,200            |
| Government Mohammedan Schools   | 655              |
| Bo School                       | 130              |
| Government Model School         | 325              |
| Njala School                    | 60               |
| Anglo-Vernacular Schools       | 80               |
| Industrial Schools              | 265              |
| **Total**                       | **11,981**       |

**Means of Communication.**

Prior to the war, steamers used to leave Liverpool for Freetown every Wednesday; there are now about three mail boats a month.

The average length of passage is 11 days to Freetown.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively. A wireless telegraphic station was opened in 1913. The main line of the Sierra Leone Government Railway, which was the first Railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the Freetown terminus to Pendembu in the Railway District, a distance of 227½ miles. The number of stations and flag stations is 53. From Boia Junction, 64½ miles from Freetown, a branch line runs to Kamabai, a distance of 104 miles; and a further extension to Baga in the Koinadugu District.

There are 1,100 miles of combined telegraph and telephone service in operation. The gauge of the Railway is 2 ft. 6 in. A few roads are under construction.

There is another line, known as the Mountain Railway, which connects Freetown with Hill Station, 5 miles distant.

There are also lines connecting the terminus with the Government Wharf, Government Quarry, Ascension Town Cemetery, and the Recreation Ground.
The total railway receipts for 1919 were £175,441; the working expenses for the same year were £204,517, this figure includes war bonus paid to European and African staff from January 1st, 1917, to Dec. 31st, 1919.

The Sherbro river is navigable for over 20 miles (up to York Island), the Sierra Leone, or Rokell river, for 40 miles (as far as Magbile).

For six months of the year the Kittam River is navigable for launches to Mopalma (about 80 miles) all the year and for 6 months to Pujehun. Much of the produce from the Northern Sherbro District is thus transported to Bonthe.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| To the U.K., India, and certain Colonies* | 1d |
|------------------------------------------|----|
| To other Postal Union and Non-Union Countries | 2½d |

Parcels up to 1 lb. in weight can be despatched at a rate of 1s. for parcels up to 3 lbs., 2s. up to 7 lbs., and 3s. up to 11 lbs. in weight.

**SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE.**

In 1884, a Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali Coast, extending from Lahadu (Loyi-ala), half-way between Ras Jibouti and Zeyla, to the 49th meridian E.long. The boundary has been settled by agreements with France, Italy and King Menelik of Abyssinia. Till 1898, the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden, as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year, it was transferred to the charge of the Foreign Office, and on 1st April, 1905, to that of the Colonial Office. The chief ports are Berbera, Bulhar, and Zeyla. Area about 68,000 square miles.

Exports consist of skins and hides, sheep and cattle, gums, ostrich feathers, and salt.

Imports consist of rice, dates, cotton piece goods and shirtings, iron and hardware.

All transport is by animals. There is a weekly steamer service with Aden.

The climate at the coast is trying for Europeans, but is comparatively healthy in the interior, where an elevation of from 4,500 feet to 6,800 feet is reached.

The Haud waterless plains constitute the principal pastures of the country. The chief source of wealth of the people lies in their live stock.

In the beginning of 1901, operations were commenced against a fanatical Somali leader, the Mullah Mohammed Abdullah, and a native levy with British Officers, under Captain (local Lieut.-Colonel) E. J. E. Swayne, Indian Army, penetrated into the Nogal Valley. After defeating the Mullah at Somala and Fordiddin, and killing 1,200 men and taking 600 prisoners, he drove him into Italian territory.

The dervishes afterwards gathered together again, and a similar expedition, strengthened by the 2nd King's African Rifles (Yaos), was despatched under Colonel Swayne in the summer of 1902, and again drove the Mullah into Italian territory with heavy loss, but met with a severe check in Italian territory at Erego, on October 6th. The Mullah, however, retired as the result of this action still further into Italian territory, to Geladi.

Five months later a third expedition, co-operating with the Abyssinian Army, under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel (local Brigadier-General) W. H. Manning, Insp.-General K.A. Rifles, comprising British and Boer M.I., Indian and African troops, with the main base at Obbia in Italian Somaliland, proceeded to Mudug, thence detaching a force under Lieut.-Colonel Cobbe, V.C., to Geladi, which place was up till then the head-quarters of the enemy. A force of 200 Yaos and Sikhs, under the late Lieut.-Colonel Plunkett, was overwhelmed at Gumburru, in April, 1903, after a fight of the fiercest description. A column of 200 men under Major Gough, being at the same time attacked at Daratoleh, whence it retired fighting to Bohotitch, and in June the expedition fell back on the Berbera-Bohotleh lines of communication, when Lieut.-General Sir C. C. Egerton, K.C.B., was placed in command.

Reinforcements, increasing the force to 7,000 rifles, were despatched and placed in the field, and in January, 1904, 3,250 troops defeated 5,000 dervishes at Jidballi, about 1,000 of the latter being killed.

In March, 1905, an agreement was concluded between the Italian Government and the Mullah Seyyid Mahammed, whereby peace was declared between the dervishes and the neighbouring tribes, both those subject to the Government of Italy and those under the protection of the British Government. The Mullah was given a port on the east coast and was assigned certain territories within the Italian sphere of interest, beyond which he and his dervishes undertook not to encroach.

In the latter part of 1908, some unrest was caused by the unfriendly attitude of the Mullah, and reinforcements were brought into the Protectorate from East Africa, Uganda, Nyasaland and India during 1909.

Subsequently, arrangements were made to arm the friendly tribes to enable them to defend themselves against attack, and in March, 1910, all troops were withdrawn from the interior; the 6th Battalion King's African Rifles was disbanded, and a policy of strict coastal concentration was then adopted. This policy having disappointed expectations, a Camel Constabulary, 150 strong, under the command of the late Mr. R. C. Corfield, was raised at the end of 1912 to check inter-tribal fighting, which by this time had assumed serious proportions. A measure of peace among the friendly tribes was quickly restored, but in August, 1913, the Corps, at a strength of 109 rank and file, encountered at Dulmadoba a raiding party of dervishes estimated at 2,000 rifles, and in the action which ensued, though heavy losses were inflicted on the enemy, the Constabulary sustained casualties amounting to 50%, including the Commandant, killed. The force thereupon fell back on Sheikh, and reinforcements of Indian Infantry were moved up from the coast. His Majesty's Government later decided to increase the forces of the Protectorate in order to preserve the necessary grazing grounds of the friendlies from dervish attack, and to maintain peace among the tribes living in the west.

In November, 1914, Military Headquarters were established at Burao, 80 miles from the coast. At this time the Dervishes were in occupation of the Ain Valley, which is one of the principal grazing grounds of the friendlies. Strong forts had been constructed by the Mullah at Jidali and Shimberr Berri, and these were used as forward bases for raids against our tribes. The position at Shimberr Berri was accordingly attacked by the local troops under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Cubitt, D.S.O., and after a stubborn resistance all the forts were finally captured and blown up. In 1914 the Dervishes made serious raids and their aggressions went on during the war, but early in 1920 operations against them were carried out by air attacks followed up by mounted forces with infantry supports. These operations were completely successful, the power of the Dervishes was completely destroyed, and the Mullah became a fugitive in Abyssinian territory.
