TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 69 miles, and its average breadth 54 miles, and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony includes the island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1899. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of Oct., 1898, it was provided that, on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, the island of Tobago should be a ward of the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony, and that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled. A proclamation was issued bringing these provisions into force from the 1st January, 1899.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalised his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th

February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago, by the census of 1911, was 333,552. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Germans, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 110,911. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of five members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted in 1898, and now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, the Inspector-General of Constabulary, the Director of Public Works, the Surgeon-General, the Protector of Immigrants, the Receiver-General, and the Collector of Customs, and of such other persons (unofficial members) as the Governor may appoint. The unofficial members hold their seats for five years, and are at present eleven in number.

**General Description.**

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south east is steep in most parts; only on the west east is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Government acquired in May, 1910, the floating graving dock and workshops formerly worked by the Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company under agreement with the Government, and the concern is now being carried on by the Government as a business administration. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 65 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the administration. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern range parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1912 were: Sugar, 663,306 cwts., cacao, 370,765 cwts., and coconuts 16,305,108. Molasses, rum, bitters, copra fruit, timber, manjack and asphalt are also exported.

In the near future it is expected that the mineral resources of the colony will become of considerable importance. The minerals at present worked are chiefly asphalt, petroleum and manjack. One manjack mine is now being worked near Williamsville in the Montserrat Ward. The Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, have drilled for oil extensively on their lands at Brighton, and four other companies are prospecting on private lands in the southern part of Trinidad. Extensive areas of Crown Lands have been issued under leases to the General Petroleum Properties of Trinidad, Limited, and the Trinidad Oilfields, Limited, in the wards of Guayaguayare and Guapo respectively; but operations are only being actively carried on at present on the lands of the Trinidad Oilfields, Limited, but operations on the lands included in the first mentioned lease are about to recommence under a new lease granted to Trinidad Leaseholds Limited. The Petroleum Development Company, the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, and the Oil Concessions of Mayaro (Trinidad Limited), are at work under prospecting licenses on Crown Lands in the wards of Guapo, Montserrat and Mayaro. In addition 69 prospecting licenses to operate over an area of 150,186 acres of Crown Lands have been duly registered, and of these some six covering an area of 12,996 acres have been merged in exploration licenses. Exploration licenses covering an area of 61,922 acres have been issued actually while agreements have been entered into with the United British West Indies Petroleum Syndicate, Limited, and the Central Mining and Investment Corporation, under which exclusive exploration licenses over large areas of Crown Land are about to be issued and on which extensive geological examinations are now being carried on. A license to explore for gold and silver has been issued, but so far little work has been done under it.

The total amount of Crown Lands involved in connection with oil development work under oil concessions in the southern oilfields of the colony amount to some 400 square miles.

A beginning has at last been made in the direction of the establishment of a fruit trade, and in 1905-6, 4,259l. worth of fruit was exported to the United Kingdom as a commencement of the industry, and in 1910, it had increased to 19,952l. There was a decrease in 1912 to 11,033l. due to diminution in rainfall. The prospects of the banana and rubber cultivations, which have been taken up in recent years, are very encouraging.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about 75,000l. sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The mean temperature for the year was 78°9 and the rainfall 49°36'.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1911, 59,796), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1912, 63 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 4,000 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

The borough of Port of Spain was placed on the 1st January, 1899, under the management of four Commissioners, styled "The Port of Spain Town Commissioners," but under an Ordinance passed on the 8th April, 1907, a "Town Board" took over the duties of the Commissioners in addition to those of the water and sewerage authorities. This Board, with Mr. Adam Smith
as Chief Commissioner, consists of 11 members nominated by the Governor.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1911 (census), 8,667), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1911 (census), 4,020). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain in 1912-13 was £93,585., the expenditure £92,262., and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was £64,080l. on the 31st March, 1913. This includes the loan of £85,000l. for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

A pitch lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of £10,000., and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease is for 21 years from 1st of January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of £4,000. a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from pitch (the majority of which came from the Lake) in 1912 was £63,453.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, which is estimated at about 1,223,880 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of March, 1912, was estimated to be approximately 606,947 acres. About 445,703 acres are under cultivation; 484,553 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

The Gulf steamers connect with the railway at San Fernando and proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain. Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the railway. Under a contract between the Government and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company a bi-weekly service is maintained between Trinidad and Tobago, with regular communication between Port of Spain and all the principal ports of each island.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles) on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Prince's Town in 1884, and further extensions to Sangre Grande (12 miles) and Tabaquite (15 miles) were opened to traffic on 29th August, 1897, and 13th August, 1898, respectively.

On the 2nd March, 1908, the Legislative Council passed a resolution approving the extension of the railway system from San Fernando to Siparia, a distance of 16½ miles, and from Tabaquite to Poole, a distance of 12 miles 70 chains, which had been recommended by a special committee in 1906. The first extension, which will pass through private lands throughout nearly the whole course, has been estimated at £196,906., and will serve a population of about 14,000 persons, with a cultivated area of over 14,100 acres. The second has been finally estimated at £124,366., and will serve a population of about 6,500 persons with a cultivated area of about 10,500 acres, which is, however, rapidly extending. The preliminary surveys have been completed and a start was made on the Tabaquite-Poole extension on the 30th September, 1911, and on a portion of the San Fernando-Siparia extension on 26th February, 1912. There are besides, 13½ miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savanna Grande belonging to the Colony, which have hitherto been controlled by Commissioners, which are to be merged into the railway system of the island. A steamer service is also maintained between San Fernando and Cedros by two small vessels running in connection with the trains. The total length of line at present open for traffic is about 81½ miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total receipts from the railways, steamers, tramways and telegraphs during 1912-13 were £100,116., and the expenditure was £63,833. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for loan interest and sinking fund, which on 31st March, 1913, amounted to £21,011.

In addition to these provisions for the service of the loans, the Colony would be entitled to £4,522., interest on additional capital advanced from time to time from general revenue, and £1,300. sinking fund on cost of the S.S. "Naparima," together 5,822., making a grand total for interest and sinking fund, £26,832.

The total number of passengers carried 1912-13 was 1,313,156, and total tonnage of goods handled was 149,379 tons.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and about 83 out-offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada and Saint Croix, and thence via Canada or the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 90½ miles, constructed by the Government.

The wireless telegraph system, established in 1906 to bring Tobago into telegraphic communication with Trinidad, gave satisfactory results during the year 1912-13. The number of steamships calling at this and other West Indian ports equipped with wireless apparatus has considerably increased, and wireless communication with ships has consequently been considerably extended. The following number of messages passed:

| Nature of Message | Number of Messages |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| At Trinidad       |                   |
| Private           | 367               |
| Official          | 154               |
| Ship              | 1,312             |
| Total             | 1,833             |
| At Tobago         |                   |
| Private           | 342               |

| Total             | 600               |

Wireless communication with British Guiana has now been satisfactorily established by the West India and Panama Telegraph Company. It is practically a duplicate of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company's cable and for
the present is for use only, under a special license, in case of cable interruption.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 90 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides a number of steamers calling for bunker coal and orders:— Royal Mail Steam Packet Co., London Direct Line, Glasgow Direct Line, Leyland Line, Harrison Line, Compagnie General Transatlantique Royal Dutch Mail, La Veloce (Navigazione Italiana) Hamburg American Line, East Asiatic Co. (Danish), James Nourse, Ltd., Pickford and Black (Canadian), Trinidad Line (Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co., Ltd.), Lampart and Holt, Prince Line, Ltd., and Compagnia de Vapores del Orinoco. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

The ocean steamers of the Royal Mail S.P. Co. make Port of Spain their headquarters and connect here with the Company's inter-colonial steamers.

The largest steamers calling regularly are those of the Lampart and Holt Line, Cie General Transatlantique and the Royal Mail S.P. Co. These steamers find no difficulty in coming well within the limits of the harbour. The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

- Within Colony .................................. 1d.
- To U.K., India and British Colonies* ........ 1d.
- To other places .................................. 2½d.

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head 63,113/0s. 8d. was expended by the Government in 1912-13, in introducing 3,120 (Statute adults) immigrants. The numbers introduced in 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901-2, 1902-3, 1903-4, 1904-5, 1906-6, 1906-7, 1907-8, 1908-9, 1909-10, 1910-11, 1911-12, and in 1912-13 respectively were 3,087, 1,860, 1,292, 1,750, 1,779, 2,475, 2,348, 2,458, 1,219, 3,604, 2,417, 1,860, 2,445, 2,511, 3,286, 3,120, and 2,370.

640 Statute adults were returned to India in 1913.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, and United States gold currency. These are all legal tender, but British gold is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of 100,000£ estimated. The Royal Bank of Canada also issues its own notes.

There is no Colonial coinage, but an Ordinance (No. 16. 1903), for the issue of Government 1 and 2 dollar currency Notes was passed on the 23rd December, 1903, and these Government currency notes are now in common use.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada have now branches in Port of Spain and San Fernando. Government savings banks are established in fifteen districts, with a head office in Port of Spain. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1912 was 231,046£. 5s. 11d. The total number of depositors was 23,695. They are under the management of a board, a chief manager of savings banks, and the local wardens.

OPENINGS FOR THE INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL.—Of the industries which offer inducements to investors of capital, in Trinidad and Tobago, the cultivation of cocoa is perhaps the most attractive, and profitable investments are to be secured either in

(a) the formation of an estate,
(b) the purchase of an established estate, or
(c) the investment of capital on the security of an established estate.

Sound investments for capital can usually be obtained for sums under £1,000 (20£. 6s. 8d.) at 10% ; from £1,000 up to £6,000 (1,250£.) at 8%; and over £6,000 at 6 or 7%.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), the Roman Catholic Institutions, St. Mary's College and the Convent School in Port of Spain, and Naparima College (Presbyterian)—the two latter being affiliated to the Royal College. Attached to these institutions are three exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of 150£., each tenable for four years, or 200£., tenable for three years, at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of March, 1913—206 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 262 on those of St. Mary's College, and 50 in the Naparima College.

The elementary schools are now 271 in number, 54 of which are secular schools, supported entirely by the Government, and 217 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the practising schools and two assisted schools 5s. per month is charged. There are two Government and three denominational colleges for teachers, in which 42 students are trained. The Government schools in 1912-13 had 10,570 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 38,420.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 50,000, with an average daily attendance of about 28,000. The teaching of practical agriculture now proves part of the daily routine in the majority of boys, and mixed schools in the Colony. 227 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1912-13.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1606. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealander were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke
of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

By Order in Council under Act 50 & 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, Tobago became a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from the 1st January, 1899.

Situation and Area.

It lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,313 acres, of which about 22,270 acres are under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

General Description.

Cocoa, coco-nuts, copra and live stock form the principal articles of export, and the cultivation of the first two is still being extended. But little sugar is now produced. Vegetables, poultry, eggs and fruit are produced in considerable quantities, and find ready sale in the Trinidad markets, to which in 1912 over 5,000l. worth were exported.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1911, of 729. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of subsidized coastal steamers, provided under contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.

The island possesses a large mileage of good roads and these are rapidly being extended and improved.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created. Various other changes have been made in the direction of reducing the establishments.
