EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The East Africa Protectorate extends from the Umba to the Juba River, from German East Africa to Abyssinia, and inland as far as the borders of Uganda. It includes certain mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the German frontier to Kipini, the islands of the Lamu Archipelago, and an area of 10 miles round the fort of Kismayu, these territories having been leased to Great Britain for an annual rent of 17,000/. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers have been defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1906, transferred to the British Court. The Protectorate consists of seven provinces and a tract of territory, now partly organised, lying to the north-west. The provinces are each under a Provincial Commissioner, and are divided into districts and sub-districts as follows: Seyidie (capital, Mombasa), comprising the districts of Vanga, Mombasa, Malindi and Mwatate, and the sub-districts of Rabai and Taveta; Ukamba (capital, Nairobi), including the districts of Kitui, Kiambu and Machakos; Tanaland (capital, Lamu), with districts of Lamu and Kipini; Jubaland (capital, Kismayu), consisting of the districts of Kismayu and Gosha; Kenya (capital, Nyeri), with districts of Fort Hall, Nyeri, Embu and Meru; the Naivasha Province (capital, Naivasha); including the districts of Naivasha, Nakuru, Eldama Ravine, Rumuruti, Masai Reserve, Uasin, Gishu and Baringo; the Nyanza Province (capital, Kisumu), including the districts of Kisumu, Lumbwa, Nandi and North and South Kavirondo, the Northern Frontier District, with headquarters at Marsabit, and another station at Moyale, near the Abyssinian boundary. The provinces of Naivasha and Nyanza were formerly the Eastern Province of Uganda, but were transferred to the East Africa Protectorate on April 1st, 1902.

The Protectorate has an area of about 200,000 square miles. Mombasa is the largest town and principal port; the inhabitants number about 30,000, of whom about 415 are Europeans. It is situated on the Eastern side of an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, on the South-Western side of the island. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the Port.

Kilindini is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa and with an ample water supply and improved harbour facilities, a scheme for which is under consideration, will be the centre of distribution for the trade of Equatorial Africa. The capital of the Protectorate is Nairobi, the headquarters of the Administration and the central station on the Uganda Railway. The inhabitants number 19,900, including 1,200 Europeans. There are also 400 European farmers and some 50,000 natives in the immediate vicinity of Nairobi. Port Florence is the railway station on Lake Victoria.

The two principal rivers in the North are the Tana and Juba, which flow into the Indian Ocean. They are both navigable for about 400 miles by shallow draught steamers.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 4,000,000, including 25,000 Asiatics and 3,500 Europeans. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Massai, the Somalis and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, German, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Legislation is by Ordinances made by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council, the Indian codes being followed as far as applicable. The High Court is situated at Mombasa, and sessions are held at Nairobi, Naivasha, Kisumu and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the East Africa Protectorate.

Climate.

The Lowlands, or districts near the coast, are fairly healthy for the tropics. The hot season is from January to April. The Highlands, or central plateaux, have a temperate climate, the mean average temperature at noon is 78° F. July, August and September are usually cold months.

Products and Trade.

The agricultural products of the lowlands are cocoanuts, rice, maize, and various native grains; cotton, sisal, rubber and tobacco are also being cultivated. Experiments with a view to a large extension of cotton growing are being made, and the introduction of other seeds and plants of economic value is being tried. In the highlands potatoes, fruit and vegetables, maize, sim sim and beans grow freely, and are now exported; coffee, wheat and barley are successfully cultivated, and on an increasing scale. On the uplands extensive pasture grounds are available for cattle, sheep and ostriches. The grading of native with imported stock has made great advancement.

The forest products of the coast are rubber, gum-copal and timber. Mangroves grow on the coast, acacia and ebony in the scrub forests further inland. The highland forests contain croton, olive, fig and several good timber trees. Several large areas of fibre-bearing land have been leased near Voi and Kibwezi for the purpose of developing the Sansevieria fibre, which is indigenous. Sisal and rubber are being extensively planted.

The mineral resources of the Protectorate are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; mica diatomite
tion Company under four weekly mail contract tranship passengers and mails to the P. & O. at connecting Mombasa with Zanzibar.

but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; mica diatomite
and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba; gold mining began, but was discontinued. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

In recent years land has been disposed of as follows:

From the beginning of 1910 the Union-Castle Line Steamship Company extended their sailings to Mombasa; these sailings take place every twenty-eight days from and to London via Marseilles. The Societa Annonima Nazionale run a four-weekly service between Genoa and Mombasa calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland. Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to two Indian firms.

The Clan Ellerman and Harrison line has a four-weekly cargo steamer from Liverpool as far as Beira.

The Uganda (Mombasa-Victoria) Railway is worked as a State Railway of the East Africa Protectorate. Its length is 586 miles, with a gauge of one metre. The construction cost to March 31st, 1913, was £925,909l. The telegraph is worked by the East Africa Protectorate Postal Department at the principal stations, and at smaller stations by the railway staff. Four steamers on the Lake are also worked in connection with the railway. In 1912-13 (exclusive of railway material) 172,694 tons of goods, and 500,304 passengers were carried.
