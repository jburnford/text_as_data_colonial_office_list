CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 36' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

Its area is 3,584 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Messoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce (or Stavrovouni), about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the English troops, of the High Commissioner, and some of the principal officials.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

History and Archaeology.

The history of Cyprus is too long and eventful to be related here except in the briefest outline. Excavations have shewn that in the second millennium B.C. the island must have been an important centre of Aegean civilization, having intercourse both with Assyria and with Egypt, and at a very early date important Greek and Phoenician colonies were established in it. In the 6th century B.C. it passed under the rule of Egypt, but in 526 B.C. it joined Cambyses in his war against the Egyptians and so was absorbed in the Persian Empire. The whole island, with the exception of the Phoenician town of Amathos, took part in the Ionic revolt in 502 B.C., but the Persians recovered possession in about a year and at the battle of Salamis the fleet of Xerxes included 150 Cypriote ships. At the end of the 5th century the famous Evagoras of Salamis established his supremacy over the whole island and raised it for a brief period to a position of practical independence, but after his death it again came under the control of Persia. After the battle of the Issus, Cyprus hastened to join Alexander the Great and sent 120 ships to assist him in the siege of Tyre. At the division of Alexander's Empire, the possession of Cyprus was disputed by Syria and Egypt, but it eventually passed to the latter. In 68 B.C. it became a Roman province and was for a time joined to Cilicia, during which period it was administered by Cicero. Presented by Antonius to Cleopatra, it reverted to Rome on her death, and remained a Roman province until the division of the Empire, when it was assigned to the Byzantine Emperor. Its proximity to Syria exposed it to the assaults of the Saracens, and it changed hands more than once between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D. It was finally recovered for Byzantium by Nicephorus Phocas in 965, and remained attached to the Eastern Empire until 1184. In that year its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. Isaac maintained his independence until 1191, but in that year Cyprus was conquered by Richard I. of England, in revenge for the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. Richard sold the island first to the Order of the Temple and later, when the Templars found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, but during that period the Genoese Republic exercised a suzerainty over part of the kingdom, from 1373 until 1464, by holding possession of the principal port of Famagusta. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island, and retained possession of it until its cession to England, in 1878, for administrative purposes.

Historical Monuments of the Country.

(1) Prehistoric and Classic Sites.—The numerous sites of Bronze Age and Hellenic communities have nearly all been ransacked and completely rifled by the various excavators of the latter half of the nineteenth century, beginning with the famous Di Cesnola and Lang. Probably very little now remains to be exploited in the future. The museums of Constantinople, New York, Italy, and elsewhere are full of objects from Cyprus. The areas turned over by the searchers for ancient graves and temple sites have now reverted once more to agricultural use. The site of the Temple of Venus, near Papho, and the site of the Roman provincial town of Salamis, near Famagusta, have, however, been scheduled as "ancient monuments" under the "Antiquities Law, 1905."

(2) Byzantine and Medieval Architecture.—Numerous ancient churches survive from the Dark Ages, before the Latin occupation of the island, but these are all either in ruins or have been very much rebuilt. They are to be found chiefly on the northern range of hills and in the Carpas. Their history is, of course, unknown, but several of them are of an interesting Byzantine character. The ruins of the medieval churches of Famagusta and Nicosia, and of the castles of the Lusignans, have been exhaustively described in "L'Art Gothique en Chypre," by Camille Enlart, published by the French Ministry of Public Instruction, 1899. Several of these very interesting monuments have been enclosed by the Government of Cyprus. Only one important building of the Venetian occupation survives, in a ruined condition. This is the Palace of the Provveditore in Famagusta. A few traces of domestic architecture, of what appears to have been an imposing character, may still be detected amongst the ruins of the mud houses, but these traces are becoming rarer every year, as the towns and villages are subjected to the continual rebuilding of the squallid Levantine style.
(3) The Turkish occupation is not represented by any architectural monument, but the great fortresses of Famagusta, Kyrenia, and the curious circular earthwork (the first and perhaps most imposing of its kind) constructed round Nicosia by Giulio Savorgnano in 1567, were very probably restored, and perhaps completed in their present style by the Turks.

Every effort is being made to preserve the remains of a remarkable historical past. Of the Classical period nothing of an architectural kind now exists above ground, and the medieval ruins are in a very mutilated and deplorable condition. A chorographic list of the ancient monuments in the island is being prepared, and the first instalment was published in 1907.

Museums.

A museum to contain the large quantity of fragments found on temple sites and in cemeteries during the last thirty years has been built in Nicosia. A large collection of medieval fragments found in Famagusta has been gathered together, and now reposes in one of the old churches devoted to the purpose.

Climate.

The mean temperature, as recorded in the screen at Nicosia, for the last ten years is 64°9° Fahr.; mean maximum, 78°2°; mean minimum, 51°7°. Highest shade temperature during that time 109°5°; lowest 25°. Average rainfall for last ten years, 18°89 inches. The year 1912-13 had a rainfall of 18°38 inches. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. Malarial fevers are prevalent during the hot months, and, if the winter is mild, they occur throughout the year. Sanitary improvements and plantations of trees have, however, had a beneficial effect.

Population.

The population of the several districts, excluding the military, at the census taken in 1881, 1891, and 1901, was:

| District   | 1901    | 1891    | 1881    |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Nicosia    | 71,289  | 61,695  | 56,300  |
| Famagusta  | 48,508  | 41,423  | 38,207  |
| Larnaca    | 26,073  | 23,760  | 20,766  |
| Limassol   | 39,139  | 35,730  | 28,717  |
| Paphos     | 35,205  | 31,674  | 28,424  |
| Kyrenia    | 16,808  | 15,004  | 13,216  |

Total       | 237,022 | 209,286 | 185,630 |

Population, Census 1911:

| District   |        |        |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Nicosia    | ...    | 81,497 |
| Famagusta  | ...    | 58,630 |
| Larnaca    | ...    | 29,737 |
| Limassol   | ...    | 46,084 |
| Paphos     | ...    | 38,508 |
| Kyrenia    | ...    | 19,752 |

Total       | ...    | 274,108 |

The Moslems form about 25°9 per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Native Cypriote Church.

The Cypriote Church is in communion with the Orthodox Greek Church, but is "autocephalous" (i.e., The Archbishop of Cyprus is not subordinate to any Patriarch). This position of independence it has retained undisputed since the 5th century when the Emperor Zeno finally decided against the claims of the Patriarch of Antioch to exercise authority over it.

Christianity was originally introduced into the island by St. Paul and St. Barnabas, the latter of whom, a Cypriote Jew by birth, was martyred at Salamis.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 16,052 (15,752 in 1901) inhabitants; Larnaca, 9,262 (7,965 in 1901); Limassol, 10,302 (8,298 in 1901). The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour. The inner harbour has now been dredged over an area of 900 feet by 600 feet, to 24 feet at low water (ordinary spring tides), with a channel of approach 250 feet wide and 26 feet deep. The curtain wall, south of Othello's Tower, has been pierced with three arches, giving access from the town to the new quay. The quay is faced with a concrete wall 900 feet long in 24 feet of water. Further accommodation for sailing vessels and local craft has been provided in a basin 450 feet long, 200 feet wide, and 15 feet deep at low water. At present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has 1,233 (871 in 1901) inhabitants, nearly all Moslem, but it is now being rebuilt and opened out. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 3,599 (2,699 in 1901), nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktima, 3,091 inhabitants (2,845 in 1901), the modern capital of Paphos, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, 1,726 inhabitants (1,336 in 1901), where a small harbour has been constructed, in the district of the same name on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania. A harbour for small Coasting Vessels exists at Paphos, the site of the ancient capital of that district. This had become silted up and almost useless, but it has recently been dredged sufficiently to enable small sailing vessels to enter and lie in safety.

Industry.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its copper mines, but with the exception of a concession granted in 1886, and since abandoned, little work has been done in recent times. A company is extracting copper from the ancient workings at Lynnii. Gypsum is exported in a raw state from the Carpas, mostly to Syria, and manufactured—i.e., in the form of plaster-of-paris—from the Carpas, Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from these ports it is mostly sent to Egypt. Asbestos is found on Mount Troodos, and a company has been formed for its exploitation.

The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, caroubs, wine and spirits, cotton, linenseed, aniseed, silk, cheese, wool, fruit, and vegetables; cattle, mules, donkeys, sheep, and poultry are also exported. Agriculture has been greatly retarded by want of water, the rainfall being deficient, and much of what does fall being allowed to run to waste. A scheme for storing water for irrigation has been carried out under the superintendence of an engineer lent by the Government of India, and is now under the direction of the Director of Public Works. The caroubs and cereals are exported mainly to the United Kingdom, France, and Egypt.
The improvement of agriculture is fostered by the Government by means of the introduction of improved machines and implements. A few harvesting machines and iron oil presses are now working successfully. The planting of mulberry, olive, carob and other fruit trees is increasing rapidly.

Cyprus wine, which has been famous from very early times, is somewhat heavy for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it acquires from the practice of carrying it to port in tanned skins. This practice has for some time been discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables the wine to be conveyed in barrels. Improved methods of manufacture are being brought into use. Both wine and spirits have, since the extra duty was imposed in France, found a fairly good demand in Egypt and in other parts of the Turkish Empire.

The restoration in recent years of a weekly direct mail service with Egypt has led to an increased production of fruit and vegetables, for which the island is well adapted. It has also given a great impetus to the export of the surplus oxen, sheep, and other animals. For the Uganda railway some 1,300 mules were exported, and stud donkeys have been exported at intervals for the Government of India.

In past years much injury was done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, were stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts were then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as they are topped with a zinc lining, they could not emerge. This system, as the locusts became more scattered, was discarded in favour of a system of collecting locust eggs and purchasing live locusts. The purchase system only is now in force.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the large number of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains a large number, and partly in consequence of the forest fires that occur through the summer months.

Sponge fishing has been extensively carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek islands. By a law passed in 1890 power was given to the High Commissioner to grant exclusive privileges for fishing the coasts for sponges.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected, and it is difficult to obtain fish all the year round except at the seaport towns.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, linseed, aniseed, silk, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, gypsum, and terra umbra.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1901, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign. Silver, 18, 9, 4½, 3 piastre pieces, limit of tender 540 piastres (nine equal to one shilling). Bronze, 1 piastre, half piastre, quarter piastre, limit of tender, 27 piastres (40 paras=1 piastre).

The Imperial Ottoman Bank has a branch established at Larnaca, and agencies at Nicosia, Limassol and Famagusta.

The Bank of Athens has a branch established at Limassol and agencies at Nicosia, Larnaca, Famagusta and Paphos.

A Government savings bank was opened on 1st January, 1903.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oke=2½lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum=about ½ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

The Government Railway from Famagusta to Nicosia came into use in August, 1906, and has since been extended to Morphou.

There is no navigable waterway in the island. Roads between all important places are maintained, and many villages are now connected with them by cart roads. Motor car services between Nicosia, Larnaca and Limassol, the three chief towns, have been introduced. The Famagusta harbour was completed in June, 1906. An extension of the pier at Larnaca, with a solid sheltering arm at the sea end, giving protection to small boats and lighters in all weathers, was completed in 1909. The ancient harbour at Paphos has recently been dredged to a sufficient depth to admit of its use by the small coasting craft that trade between Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor and Cyprus, and the area available for such craft increased in the Kyrenia Harbour. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company Limited, maintain a cable from Egypt to Cyprus and land lines connecting the six principal towns of the Island and the Troodos Government Quarters. The Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration has also a cable to the coast of Asia Minor, but it is unreliable. A weekly Mail Service is maintained between Egypt and Cyprus by subsidized steamers of the Khedivial SS. Co.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Syria, Smyrna, and Constantinople by the "Messageries Maritimes."

There is also a fortnightly service by the Austrian steamers to Syria and Egypt, and on alternate weeks to Karamania, Syria, and Egypt. The steamers of the Limassol SS. Co. and other companies ply between Egypt and Cyprus at irregular periods.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers per 2 ozs. |
|---------|----------------------|
| Within the island | ½ c. p. per ½ oz. | ¼ c. p. |
| To U.K., India, Egypt and British Colonies* | 30 paras per oz. | ½ c. p. |
| To other countries | 2 c. p. per ½ oz. | ½ c. p. |

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the island. Money Orders and British Postal Orders are also issued and paid in the island.

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of elementary schools was established in 1882.

* See end of Introduction.
In accordance with a law passed in 1895, Boards of Education have been established, one to regulate the Moslem schools and another to regulate the Christian schools. There is also in each district a District Committee for Moslem schools, and a District Committee for Greek-Christian schools, presided over in each case by the Commissioner of the District. The Education Law was further consolidated and extended in 1905.

During the school year 1912-1913 there were 390 elementary schools in connection with the Greek Orthodox Church, enrolment 26,137, which received aid amounting to 4,770£., and 155 Moslem elementary schools, enrolment 5,212, which receive aid amounting to 1,340£.

An Armenian boys' school and an Armenian girls' school in Nicosia, a school at the Armenian Monastery near Kythrea, with an infant-school in Nicosia, an Armenian mixed school at Larnaca, and 4 Maronite schools are also aided by Government; enrolment, 230.

11 elementary Moslem schools are maintained entirely by a grant from Constantinople, which amounts to 210£. a year; enrolment, 158.

4 endowed and 9 other Greek Christian elementary schools, enrolment 590, and 27 Moslem elementary, etc., enrolment 659. Elementary schools are maintained by local contributions only, without any aid from Government.

The total number of elementary schools of all classes is 605 (i.e., 193 Moslem, 412 Christian), and the total enrolment is 32,887, viz:—5,929 Moslems and 26,958 Christians.

Secondary Schools.

There is a Moslem "Idadi" school in Nicosia which is supported entirely by the Government, as an inheritance from the previous Administration.

A Greek gymnasium in Nicosia and high schools at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, and Papho, are managed by elective committees under the Secondary Education Laws, 1905-7, but are supported mainly by entrance fees, without State aid.

The "English School," conducted by English masters on the lines of an English grammar school, prepares boys who are going to England for their education and also for commerce. It has 110 pupils, chiefly sons of Government officials of all nationalities, and is supported by school fees.

Leprosy.

Prior to the British occupation, limited provision was made for lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was originally founded by the dragoman to the Turkish governor early in the century.

The asylum has been greatly improved, yearly new houses of an improved class are erected; the old premises have been pulled down and the woodwork burnt. The welfare of the inmates has been a matter of considerable attention, and a recreation room was provided by the liberality of a former High Commissioner, Sir H. E. Bulwer, which has greatly enhanced the comfort of these poor people.

A church and mosque have also been erected by voluntary subscriptions.

There is now accommodation for over 100 inmates, and the enclosed farm of 200 donums is partly cultivated by the lepers, the produce being all used on the farm. Each person receives clothing and fuel, and a government allowance of 5 copper piastres daily.

No leper quits the farm except on very rare occasions, and then only on urgent business and with the permission of the Chief Medical Officer.

The total number of lepers in the island, as returned by the census of 1911, was 101—65 males and 36 females. On 31st March, 1901, there were 113 inmates; on 31st March, 1912, there were 99 inmates; on 31st March, 1913, there were 94 inmates.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:

"I. That a Musulman religious Tribunal (Mahkemé-i-Shérîh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

"II. That a Musulman resident in the island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands* let or sold during that period.

"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arasî Miriyé vé Emlaki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

"V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

"VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

On the 14th of August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

*The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of 5,000£. a year. (Agreement of the 3rd February, 1879.)
Government.

An Order in Council, bearing date 6th July, 1907, is the instrument now regulating the government of the island. The administration is in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; there are Legislative and Executive Councils, and the High Commissioner is invested with the powers usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. The Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Paphos. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members, having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment and a fine of £2.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property and debt, &c., up to £2.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the Court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkéme-i-Shéréh, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadi, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Verghi Kimat, a tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of all immovable property.

2. Tithes of the following products of the Island:

- Cereals—taken in kind.
- Tithe-Dues are taken on exportation of: carobs, cotton, linseed, aniseed, raisins, wound silk, black seed ("Mavro Koko"), silk cocoons, and manufactured silk, if manufactured by other than hand looms.

[The tithes of all other articles have been abolished, many in 1882, sixteen in 1897, and that on olives and olive oil in 1899.]

3. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

4. Export duties on wines and spirits, and licences for the retail of intoxicating liquors.

5. An excise on tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (for locust destruction).

9. Import duties.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished.

There is a police force of about 770 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems.
