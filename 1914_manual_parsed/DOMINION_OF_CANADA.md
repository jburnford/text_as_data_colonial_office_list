DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba) were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabaska were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 255,285 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 251,700 square miles.

By Federal Act passed in the Session of 1912, the boundaries of the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba were extended. Ontario was enlarged by 146,400 square miles, Quebec by 354,961 and Manitoba by 178,100.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 87 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for Senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is now 221; 86 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 18 Nova Scotia, 13 New Brunswick, 10 Manitoba, 7 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 7 Alberta, 10 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their
ning territory was subdivided in proportional number according to their
population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $2,500 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $2,500 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot, and the franchise is regulated by the several Provincial Legislatures, which also regulate the polling divisions and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from November to May.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials who possess the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. The territory not comprised within any province (such as the North-East Territory and the Arctic Islands) is very thinly inhabited, and is governed by a Commissioner and a Council of four appointed by the Governor in Council at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, as ascertained by the census of 1861, and in the case of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by each subsequent decennial census until the population of each of these two Provinces amounted to 400,000. Each Province also received an annual allowance for Government.

The Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, whose public debts were less proportionally, at the Union than that of the old Province of Canada became entitled to receive an interest allowance, payable half-yearly, on the difference between their respective debts and certain stipulated amounts.

The annual subsidies granted to the several provinces have been revised by Imperial enactment (1907), and are now as follows:

(a) A fixed grant according to population:

| Population | Grant |
|------------|-------|
| Under 150,000 | 100,000 |
| 150,000, but does not exceed 200,000 | 150,000 |
| 200,000 | 180,000 |
| 400,000 | 190,000 |
| 800,000 | 220,000 |
| over 1,500,000 | 240,000 |

(b) A grant at the rate of 80 cents per head of the population of the province up to 2,500,000, and at the rate of 60 cents per head of so much of the population as exceeds that number.

(c) An additional grant of $100,000 yearly to the province of British Columbia for a period of ten years, from 1907.

In lieu of public lands in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which the Dominion retains, each province receives until its population reaches 400,000, an annual sum of $375,000, payable half-yearly; thereafter until the population reaches 800,000, an annual sum of $562,500; thereafter until the population reaches 1,200,000, $750,000; thereafter the sum payable shall be $1,125,000.

Each of these two provinces, inasmuch as they were not in debt at the time (1905) of their statutory creation, are entitled to be paid half-yearly, in advance, an annual sum of $405,375.

As an additional allowance in lieu of public lands, each of these provinces became entitled to an annual allowance of $93,750 for five years to provide for the construction of necessary public buildings.

By chapter 32 of the Acts of the Parliament of Canada, 1912, the boundaries of the Province of Manitoba were extended northward to the 60th parallel of north latitude, and eastward to the shores of Hudson Bay, the area of the enlarged province as a result approximating the respective areas of the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In consequence of this enlargement allowances from the Federal Treasury practically identical in amount and upon the same basis as the allowances or grants to Alberta and Saskatchewan, as recited in the preceding paragraphs became payable to the Province of Manitoba.

By chapter 42 of the Acts of 1912, an additional annual grant of one hundred thousand dollars was made to the Province of Prince Edward Island.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Provision was made by legislation of the Dominion, enacted in 1903, for the construction of a line of railway from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg, and thence to the Pacific Ocean, under the name of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The first contracts for building were let in August, 1905.
Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises: (a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 square miles; (b) villages with a population over 750; (c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised within a large district, called a county, constitute (d) the county municipality; (e) cities are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 15,000. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councillors; the towns by a mayor and councillors, and the cities by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except a portion of Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,729,665 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion (including added territory to the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba) comprise a little over 1,773,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

The imports for home consumption from the United States in 1912 were $356,354,478, and the customs duties amounted to $39,177,584.

The amount of customs duties paid in 1912 on British goods was $26,262,990.

Industry.

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. "Homesteads" of 160 acres can be obtained without any payment, and the process of settlement on the land in the west is rapidly going on; 45 per cent. of the population is engaged in agriculture, and 39,151 "homesteads" were granted in 1911, covering an area of 6,264,160 acres. In 1910 there were 3,625 butter and cheese factories and 11 factories producing condensed milk and cream. The value of land, buildings and plant is $9,677,207. The number of persons employed in factories during the year was 6,513, and the amount paid for salaries and wages was $1,872,139. The quantity of butter made in factories during the year was 63,860,812 lbs., with a value of $15,744,998; the quantity of cheese made was 221,427,087 lbs., with a value of $21,667,174; and the quantity of condensed milk, cream, etc., made was 21,552,780 lbs., with a value, including all products of condenseries, of $1,335,689. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Manufactures have been very considerably developed, the output being in 1906, $124,81, and in 1910, $161,82 per head of the population. In 1912 the estimated value of forest products was $182,300,000. The principal minerals produced in 1912 were coal $36,349,299; gold, $12,569,443; silver, $19,425,656; copper, $12,709,311; nickel, $13,452,463; asbestos, $2,959,677; lead, $1,597,554; cement, $9,083,216; pig iron (made from Canadian ore), $450,886; bricks, $7,601,380; natural gas, $2,311,126; and petroleum, $345,050. The total production of minerals was $133,127,489. Ship-building is an important industry, and besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments.

The yield of Canadian fisheries was, in 1911-12, $34,667,872.

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is 91,132.

The arrivals and clearances show, in the year 1913, a total tonnage of 131,494,496 tons. Engaged in sea going trade, 26,231,098 tons, 73,644,713 tons engaged in coasting trade, and 31,618,686 tons engaged on inland waters between Canada and the United States.

The number of steamers and sailing vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1912, was 8,380, with a net tonnage of 836,278. Of this number 3,667 were steamers, with a gross tonnage of 641,225. The number of seamen employed was over 42,000.

In 1912 the number of light stations, lighthouses, lightboats and fog-alarm stations was 975, and lights shown, 1,452; the number of fog whistles, hand fog horns, fog bells, etc., was 299; the number of gas buoys, whistling buoys and bell buoys, 373; the number of light keepers and engineers of fog-alarms, with masters of lightships, was 975.

Railways.

The increase in the railway mileage of Canada for the year ended June 30th, 1912, was 1,327, as compared with 669 in 1911, 627 in 1910, and 1,138 in 1909. Of the increase of 1,327 miles in 1912, slightly over 83 per cent. took place in the four western provinces. The total railway mileage in actual operation on June 30th, 1912, was 26,727. There were in addition 1,622 miles of railway in actual operation, but officially regarded as still under construction.

During the year ended June 30th, 1912, $60,248,325 were added to the capital liability of railways in Canada. This brings the total amount of capital invested in Canadian railways to $1,588,937,526. Of this total $770,459,361 are stocks, and $818,478,175 are funded debt. Eliminating the capital liability of railways under construction and the mileage of government-owned lines the capital obligation per mile is $50,832. Aggregate earnings of the steam railways were $219,403,753, an increase over 1911 of $30,670,269 or 16·2 per cent. The amount constitutes a record in the railway history of Canada. Operating expenses amounted to $150,726,540, an increase over 1911 of $19,691,755, or 15 per cent. The total aid paid up as given in this table includes $36,553,328 paid by the Dominion Government, $32,895,486 paid by the Provincial Governments, and $12,807,325 paid by municipalities. The total includes also loans of $25,876,533 by the Dominion Government, loans of $2,750,030 and subscriptions to shares of $300,000 by the Provincial Governments and loans of $2,404,499 and subscriptions to shares of $2,839,500 by municipalities.

The steam railways of Canada carried 41,124,181 passengers and 89,444,331 tons of freight, an increase of 4,026,463 passengers, or 10·8 per cent. and of 9,560,049 tons of freight, or 11·9 per cent. as compared with 1911. Both figures are the highest on record.

The railways of Canada have been built largely under different forms of Government aid. The principal forms of aid granted have consisted in land grants, cash subsidies, loans, the issue of debentures and the guarantee of bonds or interest. Aid has been granted both by the Dominion and Provincial Governments and also by municipalities. The total area of the land granted as subsidies to steam railway companies by the Dominion and Provincial Governments up to June 30th, 1912, extends to 56,052,055 acres.

The Dominion Government has itself undertaken the construction of the eastern portion of the new National Transcontinental Railway from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg, Man., and the expenditure on this line up to March 31st, 1912, was $116,533,769. Also the Dominion Government owns and operates the Intercolonial Rail-
way, which extends from ocean ports in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to Montreal, and the Prince Edward Island Railway. During 1912 the total cash subsidies paid to railways amounted to $3,892,818, of which $5,868,163 were paid by the Dominion Government, $26,165 by the Provincial Governments and $8,500 by municipalities. From 1851 up to June 30th, 1912, the total value of public aid granted to steam railways in Canada, exclusive of the capital of the two government-owned railways (I.C.R. and P.E.I.R.), amounted to $208,072,074. Of this sum $154,075,235 represents aid granted by the Dominion Government, $36,945,515 that granted by the Provincial Governments, and $18,051,324 that granted by municipalities.

The amount of aid paid to steam railways by the Dominion Government up to June 30, 1912, is made up of the capital of the two government-owned lines, amounting to $103,434,184 and $154,075,235, representing the aid granted by the Dominion Government to other railways. The latter includes in 1912 the sum of $4,994,417 paid to the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. under the Implement Clause of the agreement between the Government and the Company. This clause provides that the Government shall make up the difference between the amount realized in certain bonds and their par value. In each year since 1886 the aid granted to other railways includes the sum of $10,189,521 paid by the Government to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for land taken over by the Government from the Company's land subsidy.

Amongst the principal railway systems of Canada are those of the Canadian Pacific, the Grand Trunk, the National Transcontinental and the Canadian Northern. On June 30th, 1912, the Canadian Pacific had a mileage leased and owned of 10,712, as well as 754 miles of double track. The Company's gross earnings during the railway year 1912, were $116,233,812; its operating expenses were $75,388,985 and its net earnings were $40,844,827. The Grand Trunk Railway System reports that it has 4,765 miles in operation and a double track mileage of 1,037. On the eastern division of the new Transcontinental Railway from Moncton, N.B., to Fort Garry Station, Winnipeg, Man., a distance of 1,805 miles, 300 miles of track were laid during the season ended October 31st, 1912, and the total mileage of track laid to this date was 1,656. On the western section of 1,755 miles from Winnipeg, Man., to Prince Rupert, B.C., which is under construction by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, upwards of 300 miles of main line track were laid during 1912. The line is in operation from Winnipeg to Tête Jaune Cache, B.C., a distance of 1,094 miles. Track-laying at the end of 1912 had reached mile 1,109. The total mileage traffic opened and in operation is 2,194, including 240 miles from Lake Superior Junction to Winnipeg and 186 miles from Prince Rupert to Hazelton, B.C. This leaves about 450 miles to complete the main line. Eleven branch lines are under construction, and about 500 miles of branch lines are in operation. These are reported to be developing satisfactory business in the opening up of new and profitable territory and are expected to be important feeders to the main line. One hundred and eighty grain elevators have been built along the main line and branches, and the storage capacity of the Fort William elevator has been increased by 2,500,000 bushels, thus raising its total storage capacity to 5,750,000 bushels. During 1912, construction work on the Canadian Northern System resulted in an additional mileage of 983. The total mileage in operation on the Canadian Northern Railway lines is 4,317, and the total mileage in operation by the Canadian Northern System is approximately 6,600. Much of the construction work is in connection with what will be Canada's third transcontinental line extending from Quebec to Vancouver and Port Mann.

There are 49 electric railways, with a mileage of 1,224.

Telegraphs.

There are 43,480 miles of telegraph line, and 183,712 miles of wire in operation in Canada (exclusive of miles of wire of Government lines), of which 8,639, including 296 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 10,331,105 messages were sent in 1912 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 3,973, being one to every 1,879 of the population. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. The telephone is very generally used. On the 30th June, 1912, there were 370,884 telephones and 889,572 miles of telephone wire in use, of the latter, 636,962 miles were urban and 252,610 rural. The earnings amounted to $12,273,627 and the operating expenses to $9,094,689.

There were, on March 31st, 1912, 419 electric light companies in Canada, having 22,048 arc lamps and 4,093,807 incandescent lights. Every Province of the Dominion is supplied with the electric light.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. From Lake Superior to the sea there is water passage nowhere less than 14 feet deep. The total length of canals proper open is 2624 miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts for the year 1912 were $264,114, and the working expenses, including repairs, $1,141,610. Over one hundred and nineteen million dollars have been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lake Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not yet been reimposed.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills, $4.864 being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

The Ottawa Branch of the Royal Mint was established in pursuance of The Ottawa Mint Act, 1901 (1 Edw. VII., c. 4), under which an annual sum not exceeding $75,000 is payable to the
Imperial Treasury for the purpose of defraying the salaries of officials and other expenses of the Mint, the fees and all sums received being retained by Canada.

The Mint issues gold, silver and copper coins for circulation in Canada, and sovereigns and half-sovereigns coined are legal tender in every country under the British flag.

Memorandum of gold, silver, and bronze coin struck and issued by the Ottawa Mint during the calendar years 1911 and 1912:

| Bronze               | 46,599.47 | 54,480.00 | 51,096.99 | 50,000.00 |

The Savings Banks, under the charge of the Government, on March 31st, 1912, had $58,219,328 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit on March 31st, 1912, $39,526,755, and on March 31st, 1913, $40,133,561. In addition all the 26 chartered banks have savings banks branches, but the returns to the Government do not specify the amounts on deposits in these branches.

*Excluding capital and reserve.*

In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and the average monthly circulation in 1890 amounted to $15,501,360, and in 1912 to $114,621,445. The Dominion Government by statute must always hold, as security for the redemption of Dominion notes issued and outstanding up to and including thirty million dollars, an amount in gold or in gold and guaranteed securities of Canada equal to not less than 25 per cent. of the amount of such notes, the gold held to be not less than 15 per cent. of the amount. To secure the issue of notes in excess of thirty millions it must hold a dollar in gold for each dollar of notes. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government. On July 1st, 1912, the Dominion Government issued five dollar notes for the first time.

**Post Office.**

The number of letters sent in Canada in the year ended March 31st, 1912, was 566,140,000, of postcards 54,727,000. The number of offices was 13,859. The net revenue for the year ended
March 31st, 1912, was $10,482,255, and the expenditure $9,172,035.

The mail communication with Great Britain is tri-weekly via Quebec in summer and semi-weekly, via Halifax in winter. With the West Indies there is a fortnightly mail service via Halifax, and from three to four trips per week via United States ports. There is a through service twice a day across the continent from Halifax on the Atlantic to Vancouver on the Pacific coast by the Canadian Pacific and Inter-colonial Railways, a monthly direct steam service with New Zealand and via New Zealand with Australia via Vancouver. With Japan and China there is a direct connection by steamer from Vancouver once every three weeks from April to September inclusive, and once every four weeks during the rest of the year.

The rates of postage are as follows:

**LETTERS.—To Canada, United Kingdom and all parts of the British Empire, United States, Mexico and Egypt, 2 cents per oz.; to all other countries, 5 cents for first oz. and 3 cents for each subsequent oz. or fraction thereof.**

III. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada was discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonisation were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), authorising the Crown to issue a proclamation dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-8. The risings in both Provinces were caused by Governor after Governor attempting to rule by the aid of Executive Councils not possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assemblies. The rebels were suppressed with very little difficulty. Afterwards the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated; the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less
than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. Subsequently, by 17 & 18 Vict. c. 118, the Canadian Legislature was empowered to alter the Constitution of the Legislative Council. This power was utilised in 1856 by an Act of Canada which made half of the Legislative Council elective for terms of eight years. This modification was an important one, for it was because of the dissatisfaction caused by the behaviour of the elected Councillors that, on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the new Senate was made appointive. The new House of Assembly, created in 1840, consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1864 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in Council, advised by five or more Cabinet Ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 106 members; Quebec, 74 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $15 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $1,400. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $6 per day while the session lasts, and their travelling expenses.

Industry.

The industrial wealth of Ontario is derived, primarily, from its farms, its forests, mines and fisheries; secondarily, from its manufactures. In 1910, the value of the farm land, buildings, implements and live stock of the province was $1,283,000,000. There are over 24,706,669 acres of improved farm land, about half the acreage being under cultivation. The farms average 115 acres in extent, of which 81% are owned by the occupants. The average value of farm products per acre is greater than in any other province, and the total annual production is placed at $200,000,000. Dairying and the breeding and feeding of live stock are combined with general farming. The value of the cheese factory output is about $14,491,410 annually. The total dairy output is valued at $35,000,000, the live stock output at $60,000,000.

All the fruits usually grown in the temperate zone may be produced in Ontario, not only successfully, but in a very high degree of excellence. Apples constitute the principal crop, but tender fruits such as peaches, pears, plums and grapes, are very extensively grown in the Niagara peninsula. The canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables is a well established industry. From 700,000 to 1,000,000 barrels of apples are exported annually, chiefly to Great Britain.

The value of the output of the mines and mineral industries of Ontario in 1909 was $32,772,684.

Great advances have in recent years been made in Northern Ontario. The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway has opened up a large and fertile territory. The mining at Cobalt has been notable; in 1909 it was producing over 25,000,000 ounces of silver, or about one-eighth of the world's supply, but the discovery caused so much unhealthy excitement that the great majority of the companies formed to take advantage of it lost their money.

Quebec enjoys a widely distributed, though little advertised, prosperity. Oats, hay, and potatoes are the chief crops. The best known mineral product is asbestos, of which recently the supply was about 90 per cent. of the world's. The industrial development has been rapid, especially in paper and tobacco products.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for both the elementary (public and separate) and continuation and high schools (including collegiate institutes) of which there are 6,693, with 520,255 scholars in 1911. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and four theological colleges are also affiliated. There are also two non-denominational and two denominational colleges with university powers in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges for boys and girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Public libraries, day and evening industrial, technical, and art schools receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 44 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1911, 6,911 schools, with 400,148 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and eleven normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and
three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal; and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

Climate.

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°, at Montreal 42°; the extreme range being from 12° below zero to 91°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 26 inches; at Montreal 27 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between December and March is considerable.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the last census was 492,338.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonised by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I. in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the last census 46,619. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. A dry dock is also situated at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.

Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Dartmouth, Digby, Grace Bay, Kentville, New Glasgow, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney, Amherst, Lunenburg, and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney, and this city is developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production of the principal minerals, that are at present mined, for the year ended 30th September, 1911, is as follows:

- Gold ... ... ... 4,948 ozs.
- Coal raised ... ... 6,802,997 "
- Gypsum ... ... ... 280,000 "
- Limestone ... ... ... 473,067 "

There are large deposits of copper and other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe. 1,500,000 barrels were produced in 1912.

A large quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. The value of the catch of fish in 1912 was $9,567,550. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent. England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and the establishment of a plant for the construction of steel ships is proposed, and will probably be proceeded with in the near future; large bonuses are offered to encourage the establishment of such plant.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 18 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected every five years. The Members are paid $700 sessional indemnity.

Education.

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by a Board of Commissioners partly appointed by the Town Council and partly by the Government.

In 1912 there were 2,662 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 103,984 pupils. Education is compulsory in towns, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

Under "The Technical Education Act" of 1907, local technical schools have been established in all the larger industrial centres in order to produce a class of educated, skilled workmen for the various manufacturing industries. A central institution called the "Nova Scotia Technical College" has been established at Halifax, where instruction of a college grade is provided in mining, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The principal of this college is the Director of Technical Education.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,177 square miles, or about 17,393,410 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population on 1st July, 1901, was 331,120.

History.

New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 41°, the extreme range being from 19° below zero to 85°. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches, and the snowfall 75 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, from which excellent salt is manufactured, and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 65 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 7,208), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 42,511). Other towns are Moncton (11,345), Chatham (4,666), Woodstock (3,856), and St. Stephen (2,836).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 13 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 46 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were 1,867 schools, with 67,786 scholars in attendance in 1909.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville and Memramcook.

MANITOBA.

Situation and Area.
Manitoba was created into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vict., c. 3, taking effect on 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-99° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°-63° N. lat., and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 73,966 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 62,266, which had grown to 455,000 in 1911.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St. Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

By chap. 6, 2 Geo. V., Manitoba's boundaries were fixed as follows:—Western boundary to be the Eastern boundary of Saskatchewan; Northern boundary the 60th parallel of latitude; the Eastern boundary to be the present Eastern boundary as far north as the North-East corner of the Province, thence on a straight line to the most easterly point of Island Lake, and thence on a straight line to the point where the 89th meridian of W. longitude intersects the shore line of Hudson's Bay.

Present area 257,000 square miles.

History.
Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, incited by disaffected persons, rose in insurrection, and established a Provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection, having previously imprisoned 39 Canadians, shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871, the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid, but it was arrested by the United States Commander at Fort Pembina on the International Boundary.
In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence to two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights.

**Description.**

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced. "Manitoba No. 1 Hard," because of its superior milling qualities is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous. Winnipeg is now the leading grain market on the Continent.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle and dairy products. In 1912 the production was as follows:

| Product | Area in Acres | Total Yield in Bushels |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| Wheat   | 2,823,362     | 58,433,579             |
| Oats    | 1,939,982     | 87,190,677             |
| Barley  | 962,928       | 33,795,191             |
| Flax    | 196,315       | 2,671,729              |
| Rye     | 6,167         | 136,067                |
| Peas    | 2,250         | 45,985                 |
| Potatoes| 44,470        | 8,317,241              |

**Live Stock in Province.**

| Horses | Cattle | Sheep | Pigs |
|--------|--------|-------|------|
| 251,572| 407,611| 37,227| 192,386|

The average yield of wheat per acre for ten years is 19.6 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Free grant lands are still available in several districts into which new railways are being projected. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased at from $10 to $25 per acre.

The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 215 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of about 10,000; in 1896, 35,000; and now it is over 200,000. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Carberry, Minnedosa, Morden, Manitou, Deloraine, Dauphin, Souris, Virden, and St. Boniface.

Coal of the lignite variety is to be found in the Souris Valley. Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful. A sand suitable for glass is found in great quantities, and the industry is being developed.

Manufacturing industries are becoming numerous in Winnipeg, the annual output has grown from $8,616,248 in 1901 to $39,400,608 in 1911. There are now 370 factories, employing 18,000 hands, with a capital invested of $43,000,000, and manufacturing is growing also in other centres of the Province.

The Winnipeg Power Plant on the Winnipeg River about 77 miles from the City of Winnipeg, now developing about 30,000 h.p. and capable of developing 60,000 h.p., is owned and operated by the City. The cost of light is only 3 cents per K.W. hour and correspondingly cheap for manufacturing.

**Railway Facilities.**

In the year 1879 there was no railway at all in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains.

In 1912 there were in the province of Manitoba over 4,000 miles of railway, which afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.

**Climate.**

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 inches, and snowfall (November to March), 53 inches.

**Constitution.**

Manitoba is represented by 4 members in the Dominion Senate and 10 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 41 members elected by manhood suffrage for 5 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876.

The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $1,500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

**Education.**

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control was in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively. The local management was entrusted to school trustees elected by the people.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, all the previous School Acts were repealed, and a system of national non-sectarian schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns, and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school."

In 1912 there were 2,369 schools in operation, employing 2,868 teachers, of whom 651 were men, and 2,217 women.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled "The University of Manitoba," with examining and degree-conferring powers only. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical.

**Finances.**

| Year | Total Revenue | Dominion Subsidy | Expenditure |
|------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1911 | $4,454,190.07 | $838,247.06      | $4,002,826.28 |
| 1912 | $7,046,675.24 | $3,383,481.50    | $4,339,539.81 |

During 1909 $1,000,000 was borrowed in London. Of this sum $1,076,000 was for telephones; $1,000,000 was for grain elevators; $100,000 was for new judicial district.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian down to the 54th parallel, thence by summit of Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean—the average breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of coast line over 1,000 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 383,000 square miles, and the population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173, 1901, 190,000, 1911, 392,480.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and seven in the House of Commons of Canada.
Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and legislative assembly of 42 members on the system of executive administration known as a "responsible government." The assembly is elected for four years, every male adult (British subjects) having resided six months in the province, duly registered, being entitled to vote.

Members receive $1,200 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

Population.

According to the census of 1911 the population is 392,480, including 25,000 native Indians, 17,000 Chinese, 16,000 Japanese, and 5,000 natives of India.

The chief cities are Victoria (the Capital) population 67,000 (est.); Vancouver, 200,000; New Westminster, 20,000; Nanaimo 8,305; Nelson, 7,000; Prince Rupert, 6,000.

Description.

British Columbia is the third largest province in the dominion, its area being estimated at from 372,630 to 396,610 square miles. It is a great irregular quadrangle, about 700 miles from north to south, with an average width of about 400 miles, lying between latitudes 49 degrees and 60 degrees north. It is bounded on the south by the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the States of Washington, Idaho and Montana, on the west by the Pacific Ocean and Southern Alaska, on the north by Yukon and Mackenzie Territories, and on the east by the Province of Alberta.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream (Japan current) striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains; the climate is for the most part drier, and the snowfall consequently less.

Trade.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; in 1911-12 the imports amounted to $49,369,632, and the exports $20,272,840. Exports consist of minerals (chiefly gold, silver, copper and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon, halibut, herrings, whale products and oil), lumber, furs, skins, etc.

Industries.

The mineral production of the Province to the end of 1911 amounts in value to over $430,137,522, towards which sum coal has contributed $118,637,488.

A great advance has been made in metalliferous mining; the oldest districts have increased their production, while new fields have been opened up. Total output of mines for 1911, $32,440,800. There has been a corresponding increase in the population; some of these new mining districts, which a year or two ago were only inhabited by a few hardy prospectors, are now dotted with active and prosperous mining towns.

British Columbia has a vast and compact area of merchantable timber, producing an average of over twenty million dollars annually. The fisheries afford another great industry producing from eight to ten millions yearly. Only one-tenth of the available agricultural and fruit lands are at present taken up. There are immense tracts of pulp wood as yet unexploited, as well as extensive deposits of magnetite and hematite iron, and petroleum.

In 1912, 4,933 sea-going vessels (4,584,740 tons) inwards, and 4,937 (4,560,740 tons) outwards, entered and cleared, while 27,265 coastwise vessels (10,380,719 tons) entered and cleared outwards.

There are 2,250 miles of railway in operation; and 2,304 miles under construction, as the Grand Trunk Pacific and the Canadian Northern Pacific are extending their transcontinental trunk lines to the Pacific coast.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of the members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in municipal school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether cities of the first, second or third class, or district municipalities) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 30 high schools in the Province, employing 96 teachers. The number of common schools in operation is 614, under 1,491 teachers, with an enrolment of 54,704 pupils.

The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma nor creed is permitted to be taught.

Schools are established wherever there are 10 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long. Its area is 1,306,120 acres, or 2,133 square miles; it is about 130 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census (1911) was 93,728.

Description.

The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters,
fish, etc. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,080) and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro' River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

Constitution.

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $200 per annum.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

Education.

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There were in 1911 478 schools, with 17,397 scholars. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic College not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens. A new consolidated school is opened at Hillsboro' through the beneficence of Sir William McDonald, of Montreal, a native of the island. Another has been opened at Tryon by the people themselves.

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND ALBERTA.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory, were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North-West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The Territories were governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1906, the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed out of the southern portion of the Territories, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs North and South being meridian 110 West of Greenwich. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,560 square miles.

Each of these provinces is governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, with the assistance of an Executive Council. Each is represented in the Senate of Canada by 4 members, which number may be increased to 6, and in the Dominion House of Commons there are 10 members for Saskatchewan and 7 for Alberta, to be increased to 16 for Saskatchewan and 12 for Alberta by the proposed redistribution. There is also in each a local Legislative Assembly, consisting of 54 members in Saskatchewan and 56 members in Alberta. Further information will be found under the heading of Constitution of the Dominion, above.

The seat of Government of the province of Saskatchewan is at Regina, and of Alberta at Edmonton.

The population of Saskatchewan and Alberta was (1901) 91,279 and 73,022 respectively, which numbers had increased by June, 1906, to 257,763 and 185,412. The census of 1911 showed these figures had, owing to immigration, more particularly from the United States, been augmented to 492,432 in Saskatchewan and 474,663 in Alberta.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply also to Saskatchewan and Alberta. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Edmonton than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that there are 100,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement.

The estimated revenue of Saskatchewan for the fourteen months ending 30th April, 1914, was $5,542,316.99, and the expenditure $5,439,572.99. The funded debt at the end of 1912-13 was $7,266,379.99.

In Alberta the crop area, which was 298,404 acres in 1904, was 1,808,719 in 1910.

NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES AND YUKON.

The North-West Territories now consist of the territories formerly known as Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, except such portions thereof as form the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and the Yukon Territory, together with all British Territories and possessions in North America and all islands adjacent thereto not included within any province, except the colony of Newfoundland and its dependencies. The Territories are governed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor-General, with a Council of not more than four members, also appointed by the Governor-General, and the Commissioner in Council is empowered to make ordinances for the Territories.

The boundaries of the Yukon Territory were more closely defined by a Proclamation of the 16th August, 1897, amended by C. 41 of 1 Ed. VII. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 61-62 Vict., cap. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate Territory, arrangements being made for its local administration by a Commissioner under instructions given by Order in Council or the Minister of the Interior. From 1896 to 1913 the Yukon produced $130,500,000 of minerals. The population is about 6,000.
