ZANZIBAR.

The Sultanate of Zanzibar was formerly an appanage of Muscat, but in 1861 became independent under an arbitration by Lord Canning (then Governor-General of India). The dominions, besides Zanzibar Island, comprise the Island of Pemba and several other small islands, and until 1890 the Sultan's authority extended over the Coast of East Africa, from Warshelk in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude. This authority has, however, been ceded, as regards the Coast dominions, to Italy, Great Britain, and Germany respectively; Great Britain still paying rent for the territory under their protection, whilst Germany and Italy have acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of sums of 200,000l. and 144,000l. respectively.

Zanzibar Island itself, situated in 6° S. latitude, is the largest coralline island on the African coast, being 47 miles long by 20 broad, and contains an area of 640 square miles. The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and has long been a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland. It has an excellent water supply, the works for which were completed in July, 1913.

The climate is bad in the hot season, which lasts from December to March. The thermometer ranges from 77° to 90°, with a mean of 80° and an annual rainfall of 60 inches.

On the death of the Sultan in August, 1896, the palace was seized by Said Khaled, a member of his family, and to compel his submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. Seyyid Hamoud bin Mahomed was then installed. He died July 18th, 1902, and as his son, Seyyid Ali, was then only eighteen years of age, a Regency was proclaimed until June 7th, 1905, when Seyyid Ali attained his majority. The present Sultan is Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub, who succeeded on Dec. 9, 1911, on the abdication of Seyyid Ali bin Hamoud.

In 1906 the Imperial Government assumed more direct control of the Protectorate and re-organised the Government.

Six miles to the north of Zanzibar lies the small and densely wooded but waterless Island of Tumbatu, and some 30 miles further north lies the Island of Pemba, with an area of 380 miles.

The islands are fertile, providing cloves, coconuts, chillies, and other tropical products, and the exports gathered from the mainland include ivory, rubber, gum, hides, ebony, and tortoise-shell. The principal imports are Manchester cotton goods, hardware, rice (from India), coal, and petroleum.

The population is 197,199, which includes about 10,000 Arabs and about 20,000 Indians. The total European population numbers about 250.

As the centre of the Arab power, Zanzibar from the beginning of the nineteenth century until quite recently dominated the trade of East Africa. The island contributes comparatively little to the actual commerce of the world beyond a very considerable export of cloves, worth on an average 300,000l. per annum, but it serves as a "gigantic go-down" or storehouse for the whole East African coast, where both imports and exports are received and distributed.

Of late years the importance of Zanzibar as a port of transhipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast. Recent figures, however, tend to indicate that the island, in spite of losing the main transhipment trade, will continue, from the very fact of its geographical position, to retain control of the local traffic, of that portion of the trade which goes to small towns up and down the adjacent mainland coast.

The trade of the Port of Zanzibar in 1912 was shared by the principal countries as under:

| Country                  | Imports   | Exports   |
|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| British India            | £378,508  | £201,056  |
| German East Africa       | £102,163  | £162,525  |
| United Kingdom           | £137,603  | £90,841   |
| France                   | £7,869    | £195,446  |
| South Africa             | £44,295   | £48,218   |
| Holland                  | £68,613   | £725      |
| U.S.A.                   | £45,611   | £47,271   |
| Germany                  | £31,644   | £110,338  |
| East African Protectorate| £76,696   | £124,296  |

The number of ocean-going steamers which entered the port in 1912 was: German, 149; British, 124; French, 30; the total tonnage being 781,819. Since 1902 the number of local dhows has been steadily decreasing. In that year the number registered at the Port Office was 541, the number registered in 1912 was 293. This decrease is to be attributed to the fact that the local carrying trade is being transferred from the dhow to the small coasting steamer. 191 coasting vessels (26,924 tons) and 4,476 dhows (66,467 tons) entered the Port in 1912.

The town of Zanzibar is lighted by electric light, and possesses a telephone system. There are wireless telegraphic stations on Pemba and Zanzibar Islands, and the German Government have recently erected a wireless station on the
mainland at Dar-es-Salam, 42 miles from Zanzibar. There are 75 miles of roads suitable for motor traffic in Zanzibar, and the construction of light tramways in Pemba is under consideration. On July 1, 1913, the Protectorate was transferred from the control of the Foreign to that of the Colonial Office.

The revenue in 1912 was £242,483; and expenditure £334,679; public debt, £68,861.
