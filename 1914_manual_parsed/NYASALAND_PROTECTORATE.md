NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.

(See Map under Rhodesia, South Africa.)

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shiré Highlands and Mlanje.

It is bounded on the north by German East Africa, on the west by the British South Africa Company's Territory known as "North Eastern Rhodesia," on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and has a total area of about 39,801 square miles, according to the most recent survey.

It is divided into fourteen districts, each in charge of a resident, who is also a district magistrate. An agent of the Government is stationed at Chinde at the mouth of the Zambesi, where a concession has been leased from the Portuguese Government as a landing and forwarding depot for goods intended for British Territory north of the Zambesi, and where a Postal Agency is also established.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 300 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

History.

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (now Sir H. H. Johnston, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaus round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shiré districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wahenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (now Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shiré and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaus at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. On the 22nd February, 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in October, 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

Constitution.

The administration of the Protectorate, which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Mombasa.

Climate and Products.

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shiré Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shiré Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shiré Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.
Industry.

The chief products of the Protectorate are cotton, tobacco, coffee, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat and fibre.

Coffee, at one time the staple product, has declined; cotton has rapidly increased, the export in 1912-13 being 8,093 bales of 400 lbs. 93 per cent. of the export trade is to the United Kingdom. Tobacco shows an even greater increase, the export in 1912-13 being 2,262,545 lbs. Further development is greatly dependent on improved transport, as during the dry season the Shiré River is shallow.

The chief imports are, provisions, cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition. 72 per cent. of the imports come from the United Kingdom.

Population (31st March, 1913).

Europeans, 758; Asiatics, 356; Natives, 1,020,537.

Means of Communication.

A railway from Port Herald (the inland "port" of the Protectorate) to Blantyre (113 miles) is open for traffic. An extension from Port Herald to the Zambesi is under construction and further extensions to Beira and to Zomba and Fort Johnston, on Lake Nyasa, are projected. There are eleven British steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shiré between Chinde and the highest navigable point of the Shiré, whence the journey to the Shiré Highlands is continued by rail and road. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being 3,156. There are seven steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Steamers arrive and depart every three weeks at Chinde (the port of entry at the mouth of the Zambesi) to Europe, via the Suez Canal, or by Durban and Cape Town. Mails to and from England, are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

Telegraphs.

The African Trans-continental Telegraph Company's line is in use from Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika southwards through the Protectorate, via Blantyre and Tete, to Umtali in Southern Rhodesia and thence to Cape Town and England. A message from Zomba to London takes about twenty-four hours in transmission. The total mileage through the Protectorate is 808 miles.

Education.

There are no Government schools, and native education is in the hands of the missionary societies. There are 1,527 schools, at which 119,402 natives receive instruction, which is largely practical. An annual grant of 1,000l. is made by Government.

Currency and Banking.

By a Proclamation in the Official Gazette of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling.

Banking operations in the Protectorate are governed by "The Banking Ordinance, 1902."

Two Banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., The Standard Bank of South Africa, and The African Lakes Corporation, Limited; the latter have also a branch at Zomba.

A Post Office Savings Bank has also been established in the Protectorate.

ST. HELENA.

Situation, Area, &c.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of Africa, in 15° 55' S. lat., and 6° 42' W. long. It is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from England, 17 days, and from Capetown, 6 days.

A census taken in May, 1901, showed a population of 9,850, of whom 4,850 were Boer prisoners of war, and 1,428 members of the garrison. The inhabitants numbered 3,342. A census taken in April, 1911, showed a population of 3,520, of whom 34 were members of the E.T.C. Staff, and 43 were sailors of the ships in port.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population of 1,439. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer in Jamestown ranging in summer between 68° and 84°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall in 1912 was 44 inches in the country. The island is very healthy, the average death-rate for the three years ended 1906 having been only 13½ per 1,000, including seamen landed in the island seriously ill. The death-rate for 1911 was 10·9 per 1,000 inhabitants; 1912, 12·5 per 1,000 inhabitants.

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1502. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. The Dutch held it from 1645 to 1650, when they abandoned it. It was taken possession of by the East India Company in 1651, and a charter for its administration was granted in 1661. In 1665 it was seized by the Dutch, who were, however, expelled the same year. Again, in January, 1673, they seized it, to be driven out finally in May, by Captain Munden, of the English Navy. A new charter was issued by Charles II. to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.

The Government maintain 3 schools, having 315 scholars. There are also 6 endowed and private day schools, two of which are aided by Government, having 349 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 11 of 1903, and fees of 1d. a week per child are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1912 were 837l. and 796l.

Industry.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of
the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818 a law was passed that all future children born in the Island should be free.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre (phormium). The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost the yield was only about three tons of fibre, though, under present conditions of working, ten tons of phormium leaves give one ton of fibre and a quarter ton of tow. The industry has now been re-started with the help of a grant from the Home Exchequer, and it is hoped that this will do something to relieve the lack of employment and consequent distress resulting from the recent withdrawal of the Imperial Garrison. The Government Mill opened in 1907, but was closed down in May, 1910, on exhaustion of millable leaf. It was reopened on the visit of H.R.H. Duke of Connaught for a few weeks. It was again re-opened on 13th November, 1911 and still continues to run. The amount of green leaf milled in 1912 was 1,202 tons, producing 114½ tons Fibre and 35 tons of Tow valued at £3,400.

There is said to be a field for capital in the preparation of the fibre from the *Furcraea gigantea*, an aloe which grows wild all over the island. Forty tons of aloe leaves yield one ton of fibre.

A lace-making industry was established in August, 1907, with the help of a grant from Imperial funds. It is now controlled by the Colonial Government.

Trade depends upon the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress, and has greatly diminished in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal. The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war was, in 1910, 51; 1911, 64; 1912, 60. It is a port of registry.

The chief industries are phormium fibre and lace-making, fishing and agriculture, the main arable crop being potatoes.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1912—£12,238), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at from ½ to 1 per cent.

**Means of Communication.**

Steamers arrive from England at regular intervals of 4 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal; steamers arrive from thence at the same interval, and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 6 days. The rate of postage to the U.K., India, and certain Colonies is 1d. per oz.; to other parts of the world 2½d. per oz. There is no internal post, but there are 40 miles (about) of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 400l. The new cable from the Cape (which is being worked by the Eastern Telegraph Company with a staff of 30, including a Superintendent) reached St. Helena at the end of 1899, and was carried forward to Ascension by February, 1900. It is completed to St. Vincent.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of His Majesty in Council.
