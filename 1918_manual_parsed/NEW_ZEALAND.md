NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

By a Proclamation of His Majesty the King, published in the London Gazette, the Colony of New Zealand is to be styled "the Dominion of New Zealand" on and from the 26th September, 1901.

The Dominion of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the South, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Dominion: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 536 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43°45' S. lat., 176°17' W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island and adjacent islets is 44,130 square miles, of the South Island 58,120 square miles, of Stewart Island 662 square miles, of Chatham Islands 372 square miles, and other islands, including the Cook Islands, 577 square miles, a total area of 103,861 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 & 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. long., and 33° and 53° S. lat., were annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, was annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macauay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands was administered through the Governor of New Zealand until 1900; in October of that year the group was annexed to Her Majesty's Dominions, and resolutions were passed by the New Zealand Parliament for the extension of the boundary of the Dominion to include the group as well as Savage (Niue) Island and other small islands. By proclamation finally fixing the date from which the boundaries of New Zealand are deemed to be extended, from the 11th June, 1901, the following islands are included:—Rarotonga, Mangaiia, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mitiaro, Mauke, Hervey (Manuae), Palmerston (Avarau), Savage (Niue), Pukapuka (Danger), Rakaanga, Manahiki, Penrhyn (Tongareva), and Suwarrow. An account of the Cook Islands is given below.

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the average death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (56°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (51°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington is 50°, from 82° in summer to 32° in winter. The rainfall varies from a mean for the year of 25 inches on the east coast, to 116 inches on the west coast of the
South Island, and from 37 inches on the east coast, to 59 inches on the west coast of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the 10 years 1907-1916 was 26·42 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 9·52. The birth rate in 1916 was 25·94 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 9·64.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840 the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1916, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 49,776, almost all of whom dwelt in the North Island.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1850.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 & 16 Vict., cap. 72. By that Act New Zealand was divided into six provinces, afterwards increased to ten, but subsequently reduced to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vict., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers were now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished, provision was made for the division of the Dominion into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1862, consisting of the Governor (now Governor-General), a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor-General is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Dominion for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor-General, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments were made tenable for seven years only. Provision has now been made for an elective Legislative Council to consist of 40 European members and not more than 3 Maori members, the latter to be appointed by the Governor-General. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every male elector is qualified to become a member. The House of Representatives now consists of 80, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to October.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 200l. a year, payable monthly.

Members of the House of Representatives receive 25l. a month, amounting to 300l. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races) the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Dominion and one month in an electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act, 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a property or residential one. Women can vote as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the New Zealand Government. In 1865 the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Dominion is divided into 115 municipalities and 125 counties; the latter being subdivided into 126 road districts and 64 town districts, besides River, Drainage and Water Supply Boards. For the year ended 31st March, 1916, the total receipts of the above local authorities amounted to 6,014,194l., and their expenditure to 5,365,308l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to 14,146,387l. For the year ended 31st December, 1915, the receipts, expenditure and debt of Harbour Boards amounted to 1,386,201l., 1,246,790l., and 7,135,895l. respectively, and of the Christchurch Drainage Board, for the year ended 31st March, 1916, to 33,452l., 36,527l., and 359,500l. respectively. The Dunedin Drainage and Sewer...
Education.

A Government system of primary education was established in 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of Education Boards, and of School Committees with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of primary schools (called "public schools"), 2,355; scholars on roll, 185,884. Primary education is free, secular, and compulsory. In addition for native (Maori) education there are 118 village schools maintained by the Government and under the control of the Minister, and ten denominational boarding schools. Scholars on roll of village schools, 5,132 (including 572 Europeans); on the roll of mission schools, 120; and on roll of boarding schools, 457, of whom 101 hold free places. Net cost of native school education in 1916-17 was £41,792. In the outlying Chatham Islands four schools are maintained by the Government, and three schools, under the control of the Cook Islands Administration, have been opened in the Cook Islands. 197 private primary schools with a roll number of over 17,000 were registered under the Education Act. A school journal providing suitable reading matter is provided by the Department and issued free to all children in Government schools. A comprehensive system of physical education and a scheme of medical inspection are in operation in the primary schools. Four training colleges make provision for the training of over 400 teachers annually. There is also provision for training classes at smaller centres. Cost of training teachers, £50,027. The total expenditure by the Government under the head of primary education was for 1916-17, £1,318,000. There is a system of superannuation for teachers giving an annuity of one-sixtieth of the average of the final three years' salary for each year of service.

Secondary education is provided at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools, the numbers of schools under each heading in 1916 being 33, 60, and 8 respectively, and the roll numbers being—secondary schools, 7,052; district high schools (secondary departments), 2,386; technical high schools, 2,106. In addition seventeen private secondary schools were registered under the Education Act, the roll number being 1,004. In scholarships and free places at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools about 10,132 pupils received free secondary education. Provision is made for manual instruction in both primary and secondary schools, cookery, dress-making, woodwork, elementary agriculture, dairywork, and the various branches of elementary science being included in the subjects taken. Instruction of a technical or vocational character is provided at a large number of technical schools and classes, the courses of instruction followed being commercial and general, industrial, domestic, and art. The total number of students attending such classes in 1916 was 17,586, of whom 5,917 took group courses occupying not less than 80 hours a year, and also of whom 4,060 received free education. In addition there were 2,106 pupils at technical high schools, where the instruction is of secondary grade with a vocational bias.

For higher education there are four endowed colleges affiliated to the University of New Zealand, and each specializes in one or more directions. At Dunedin the special subjects are mining, medicine, dental and veterinary science, and domestic science; at Christchurch, engineering and technical science; at Wellington, law and science; at Auckland, commerce and mining. There is an agricultural college possessing a large endowment and an experimental farm of a very complete character. The number of students on the books of the University Colleges was, in 1916, 1,985, of which number 857 were receiving free education. The total expenditure by the Government on university education was £54,453.

The care of neglected and delinquent children is managed by the Education Department, which adopts the boarding-out system, combined with various residential institutions serving for the classification of those that have to be kept under discipline. Of the 3,284 children on the Department's books 1,009 were in residence in Government or private industrial schools or reformatories, and 1,082 were boarded out with foster parents. The rest were at service, with friends, etc., under licence. On the grounds of moral degeneracy or unfitness in the public interest to be free from oversight detention beyond the age of 21 may be extended by a magistrate from time to time, thus securing life-long control where necessary. Expenditure for 1916-17, £41,409.

Maintained or subsidized by the Government are special schools for the blind, the deaf, and the feeble-minded. Blind: Government subsidy, £2,087; for 33 pupils; deaf: 98 pupils cost the Government £4,277; feeble-minded: 69 pupils cost £6,255, and £7,492 was expended on buildings for further accommodation and on opening a new institution for girls. The education of blind, deaf, feeble-minded and epileptic children is compulsory from six to twenty-one years of age, subject to exemption by the Minister. The feeble-minded can be kept permanently under restraint, each case being judicially reviewed at intervals of not more than four years.

The infant life protection system which provides for the supervision of infants under six years who are maintained apart from their parents for monetary consideration is also administered by the Education Department. There are 1,250 infants under supervision in 1,054 licensed homes. The death rate is under 1 per cent.

The statistics given above relate mainly to the year 1916. The total cost to the Government for the financial year 1915-16 under the head of education was £1,689,707.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 15th October, 1916, was found by the census to be 1,099,449 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 49,776, and Cook and other Pacific Islands (12,797). The estimated population of New Zealand (excluding Maoris and residents of Cook and other Pacific Islands), on 30th June, 1917, was 1,096,240.

The population of the chief towns on the 28th March, 1886; 5th April, 1891; 12th April, 1896; 31st March, 1901; 29th April, 1906; 2nd April, 1911; and 15th October, 1916, was as follows:—
Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Dominion up to 31st December, 1916, was valued at £85,847,673. The wool exported in 1916 amounted to 185,506,850 lbs., valued at £12,386,074. In 1856 it amounted to 2,559,618 lbs., valued at £146,070. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at £19,339, had developed an export for 1889 of 656,822 cwt., valued at £783,374; in 1893 to 903,836 cwt., valued at £1,085,167; and in 1898, 1,551,773 cwt., valued at £1,698,700; in 1903, 2,378,050 cwt., valued at £3,197,043; in 1908, 2,120,303 cwt., valued at £3,188,515; in 1910, 2,654,196 cwt., valued at £3,850,777; in 1911, 2,250,565 cwt., valued at £3,053,406; in 1912, 2,573,238 cwt., valued at £3,909,569; in 1913, 2,578,693 cwt., valued at £4,449,932; in 1914, 3,229,973 cwt., valued at £5,963,062; in 1915, 3,591,260 cwt., valued at £7,794,395; and in 1916, 3,326,045 cwt., valued at £7,271,319. The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1917,* was: horses, 367,167, against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 2,502,700, against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 25,270,386, against 11,704,853 in 1874. The total area of occupied holdings in 1917 (preliminary figures) was 42,709,337 acres; 219,121 acres were in wheat (for threshing only), having a total yield of 5,055,457 bushels. The area under oats for all purposes was 553,513 acres, of which 178,397 acres were threshed, giving a total yield of 5,470,405 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton, Napier, Nelson, Wellington and Timaru are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1916, 580 vessels registered, of 92,295 (net) tons in the aggregate.

* Figures subject to revision.

† In each case the Metropolitan Areas include a greater area than the former "City and Suburbs." These figures are therefore to that extent incomparable with those for previous censuses.

Many of the larger vessels formerly on the register were transferred to the London register to take advantage of the Imperial War rates.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware and machinery, sugar, tea, alcohol, books, and stationery; and they are obtained almost entirely from England, Australia, the United States, Canada, Ceylon, Japan and China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches in the Dominion.—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, Bank of Australasia, and Commercial Bank of Australia (Limited). The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand for the year 1916 (average of four quarters), was £37,757,917, and of their note circulation £4,049,527. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Dominion, having now 786 branches; the amount deposited therein on 31st December, 1916, was £25,603,209. The private savings banks number five, and the total amount to credit of depositors at March 31st, 1917, was £2,412,465.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Government Insurance Department.

Life Branch.

This department commenced to transact business in March, 1870. By an Act of 1886 an official board to control and manage the investment of a portion of the department's funds in mortgages on land was constituted. This board consists of the Minister of Finance, the Solicitor-General, the Surveyor-General, the Superintendent N.Z. State Advances Office, the Public Trustee, and the Government Insurance Commissioner. Loans on mortgage not exceeding £10,000, to any one person or company are empowered. All policies are guaranteed by the State.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the premium rates are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first-class lives to the amount of £5,000, and in the case of the Accident Branch to the amount of £1,000. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves.

Accident Branch.

The Accident Branch of the Government Insurance Department was opened in 1901, for the purpose of transacting Personal Accident Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance. General accident business is undertaken, but the branch was opened more especially with a view to relieve employers of labour of the liability imposed upon them by "The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900." This Act greatly extended the liability of employers, and gave to a workman the right of compensation for all injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, not attributable to his own serious and wilful misconduct.

This liability has been more or less extended by subsequent Acts, and under "The Workers' Compensation Act, 1908," which came into operation on the 1st January, 1909, and its amendments, the scale of compensation is as follows:

(a.) Where death results from the injury and the workman leaves dependants wholly dependent upon his earnings, the compensation is one hundred and fifty-six times his average weekly earnings, but not to be less than £200, nor to exceed £600.
(b.) If the dependants are only partially dependent upon the workman's earnings, the compensation is to be such sum as is reasonable and proportionate to the injury to such dependants, but not exceeding the amount payable under paragraph (a).

(c) In either of the above cases the employer is also liable for medical and burial expenses not exceeding 50l., and an amount not exceeding this sum can be claimed where there are no dependants.

(d) Where a workman is totally incapacitated for work, he is entitled to a weekly payment of one-half his average weekly earnings, but the weekly compensation is not to be less than 1l. in cases where the worker's earnings at the time of the accident are not less than 30s. per week. Persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour, whose earnings exceed 5l. per week, are excluded from the benefits of the Act and the maximum weekly payment is limited to 2l. 10s.

(e) Where the workman is partially incapacitated only, the compensation is one-half the loss of wages.

(f) In addition to the compensation for incapacity medical or surgical expenses are allowed, not exceeding 1l.

Weekly payments are not to extend over a longer period than six years, and the aggregate amount is not to exceed 500l.

The Department's policies cover the full liability of an employer to his workmen under the Workers' Compensation Act, and the liability under common law to the extent of 500l. per man.

The premiums are assessed on the wages, and vary from 4s. and 6s. per 100l. of wages for the lightest occupations to 20s. per cent. for building trades, 60s. per cent. for coal mines to cover accidents only, and 100s. per cent. for bush felling.

Policies protecting mortgages from loss through the charge of an injured workman taking precedence of a mortgage are issued at premiums varying from 1s. per cent. of the mortgage for small mortgages to 6d. per cent. for large mortgages.

Personal accident policies are also issued securing amounts for accidental death and permanent total or partial disablement, and weekly allowances during temporary disablement.

The premium income and claims of the Accident Branch since the commencement of business have been as follows:

| Year                  | Premium Income | Claims |

State Fire Insurance.

In the year 1903 was passed an Act "to establish a State Fire Insurance Office and to make other provisions for the insurance and protection of insurable property in New Zealand against loss or damage by fire."

The statute provided for the establishment of an office to be administered by a General Manager appointed by the Governor-General, and for the necessary staff—not subject to the laws regulating the Civil Service.

Provision is made for the constitution of a Board, to consist of the General Manager, the Minister of Finance, the Government Insurance Commissioner, and two other persons (not being in the Civil Service) appointed by the Governor-General. The latter hold office for two years, with eligibility for re-appointment.

The Department opened for business with branches and agencies throughout the Dominion in January, 1905. The opening of the office resulted in a reduction in the rates then current of 3¾ per cent. on dwellings and the less hazardous risks, and of 10 per cent. on all others. The profit made to the end of December, 1916, was 121,915l., and the net income and net losses for each of the twelve years to that date have been as follows:

| Year | Net Income, less Re-insurances | Net Losses |
|------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1905 | 13,135                        | 2,417      |

Public Works.

All the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony. In the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement, but in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made, and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under road boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1917, there were 2,970 miles of Government and 29 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand, and 243 miles of Government under construction. The construction of new lines and the extension of existing ones has proceeded steadily in recent years but has necessarily been held up during the last year or so on account of the war.
The expenditure on the 2,970 miles of Government railways has been £35,378,664., or an average of £11,912. a mile. This includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1916-1917 was £4,800,810., and the working expenses £2,026,864. The balance of £1,873,946. is equal to a return of 54. 5s. 1½d.* per cent. on the capital invested. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraph and inter-urban telephone circuits there are 13,896 miles of line and 50,320 miles of wire. There are 337 Morse telegraph offices, 2,072 telephone offices, and 259 telephone exchanges, the latter having 62,523 connections with 3,897 miles of line and 142,469 miles of wire. 237 coin-in-the-slot telephones are in use.

The duct underground system of telephone cable distribution, and the automatic telephone switching system is being extended to the principal exchanges. There are seven submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand; two, Wellington-Sydney, one Auckland-Sydney, and one Auckland-Brisbane, via Norfolk Island, connecting the Dominion with Australia.

The Pacific cable, which was opened for traffic to Australia and Fiji in April, 1902, was completed to Bamfield, Vancouver Island, on the 31st October following, and opened for international traffic on the 8th December, 1902.

On the opening of the Pacific cable for through traffic the ordinary rate to Great Britain was 3s. a word, Government messages 1s. 6½d., and Press 1s. a word. This rate has now been reduced by 4d. per word for ordinary messages, and 2½d. per word for deferred and Government messages. The charge for press messages has since been reduced to 7½d. per word and a deferred rate for press instituted at 4½d. per word.

An ordinary deferred telegram system has been instituted with a maximum delay of 24 hours at half the charge for ordinary cable messages, also a system of "Week-end letter" cable messages at the following rates:—To the United Kingdom, 3½d. per word, with a minimum charge of 13s. 4½d.; to Canada, 6½d. per word, with a minimum of 10s.

The average number of messages transmitted to and from New Zealand prior to the opening of the Pacific cable was about 425 per day. The present average is about 1,200 a day by both routes.

In the year ending 31st March, 1917, excluding the value of Government messages, the revenue was £844,524. (including telephone exchange and other telegraph receipts); number of messages 10,875,120 (of which number 10,734,168 were private or press messages). The minimum rate on ordinary telegrams is 8½d. for 12 words; additional words ½d. each.

There are five New Zealand coast stations, two of which are medium power, for the transmission of telegrams by radio-telegraphy. These provide for the needs of shipping around the coasts. The Awanaui station communicates with Samoa.

In addition there are twenty-three wireless ship-stations registered in New Zealand.

Tramways have been established in all the principal towns in New Zealand, and Dunedin has, in addition, three cable lines leading to high-lying suburbs, and Wellington an incline line.

The ordinary tramways are in some few cases worked by steam motors, but electric power is more generally employed.

Auckland, Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, New Plymouth, Invercargill, Napier and Wanganui have electric tramway systems on the overhead principle, while a system in Gisborne is worked with storage battery cars.

The total expenditure by the General Government on the construction of roads and bridges from the inauguration of the Public Works policy in 1870, till the end of March, 1917, amounted to £11,261,098.

The Government has also expended £631,602. on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels, also £214,412. in aiding works on mineral lands, etc.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations.

All the principal towns in the Dominion have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas.

In Wellington the streets are illuminated by the electric light, as also are the parliamentary buildings and many private houses and business establishments.

The Government has designed and carried out an important scheme for the development of electrical energy from water power at Lake Coleridge in Canterbury. The powerhouse is designed to generate 12,000 kilowatt, the present plant capacity being 6,000 kilowatt, and the present output about 5,000 kilowatt, which is rapidly increasing. The bulk of the current is carried at high voltage over two separate transmission lines to Christchurch, seventy miles distant, where it is utilised to operate the tramways, and for public and private lighting, manufacturing and general industrial purposes. Future developments will probably include the operation of suitable sections of the Government railways, the manufacture of fertilisers, and possibly of munitions of war. The scheme is under the direct control of the Government, and has been in successful operation since February, 1915. There are many other natural sources of power available in different parts of the Dominion, and the development of one or other of the most promising in the North Island is in contemplation. The Lake Coleridge scheme has cost up to the present £366,984. and is within easy measurable distance of a point where the revenue will more than cover interest on expenditure, cost of operation and maintenance.

Dunedin is lighted by electricity generated by water power from the Waipori stream, under the control of the City Corporation, which also supplies electrical energy from the same sources for industrial and manufacturing purposes.

Other towns with electrical installations for street and private lighting are Auckland, Whangarei, Rotorua, Napier, Hastings, New Plymouth, Stratford, Inglewood, Hawera, Patea, Reefton, Ross, Christchurch, Timaru, Gore, Mataura, Frankton, Te Aroha, Waitara, Eketahuna, Feilding, Tauranga, Gisborne, Winton, Ashburton and Bluff.

The coasts of the Dominion are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Lyttelton, Greymouth, Westport, New...
Plymouth, and Napier. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.

Road and railway formation works are carried out under small contracts and by the co-operative system, under which the Government provides all materials and lets the work of construction to parties of labourers and artisans at rates fixed by Government officers on the ground. These rates are calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 9s. to 12s. per day for artisans, and from 9s. to 10s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day. Buildings and large bridges are built by contract, let after inviting tenders through the press.

Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England and Europe and with Australian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States and Canada.

Postage Rates.

Up to 23rd September, 1915, the postage on letters inland was 1d. for the first 4 ounces, or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each succeeding 2 ounces or fraction thereof, and to such places as accept matter at the reduced rate, 1d. for each ounce or fraction thereof. The reduction (to 1d. per ounce) applies in any case to British possessions, and to a number of foreign countries. The letter postage to other places beyond New Zealand is 2½d. for the first ounce, and 1½d. for each succeeding ounce, or fraction thereof. The minimum rate for newspapers printed and published in New Zealand, for the United Kingdom, is 1d. for each newspaper, irrespective of weight, but subject to certain conditions as to despatch. The ordinary rate for Australia and New Guinea (except Dutch New Guinea) and certain other British possessions is 1½d. for each newspaper. The rate for newspapers for other places, and for newspapers not printed and published in New Zealand addressed to the United Kingdom, is for each newspaper—1½d. for the first 4 ounces, and ½d. for each additional 2 ounces or fraction thereof. The inland rate for newspapers remains at ½d. each. The inland parcel post rates are:—4½d. for the first lb. and 2½d. for each additional lb. up to 6 lbs., and 1½d. for each additional lb. up to 28 lbs. A special fee of 6½d. is also charged on all inland parcels which the senders desire forwarded to destination in hampers.

From the 23rd September, 1915, an additional ½d. has been imposed on all postal packets (except newspapers) posted in the Dominion. The additional ½d. however is not charged on articles to places beyond New Zealand to which the maximum Postal Union rates previously applied.

DEPENDENCIES OF NEW ZEALAND.*

COOK ISLANDS.

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and the Hervey Islands, Manuae, Te Au-o-Tu and Takutea by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

Until 1901 British authority was represented by a Resident who was paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reported direct to the Governor of that Dominion. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moss, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continued to enjoy self-government in such purely local affairs as it could properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government was composed of the Ariki, or Kings and Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, was the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court was established, and a law was passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts were subject to the approval of the Resident, who was also a Deputy and Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and Chief Justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands.

The Islands became part of the Dominion of New Zealand from the 11th June, 1901. The administration and laws were continued in force subject to the provisions of the Cook Islands Government Act, passed in that year.

In 1915 an Act was passed by the New Zealand Parliament consolidating the laws relating to the Cook Islands and Niue Island, and providing for the appointment of a member of the Executive Council of New Zealand as the Minister for the Cook Islands, who is charged with the administration of the government of the Islands.

The Act also makes provision for the constitution of Island Councils; for the establishment of public schools, Courts of Justice, Native Land Court, etc.

Minister for the Cook Islands. Hon. Dr. M. Pomare.

Secretary of Cook Islands, G. C. B. Jordan.

Resident Commissioner at Rarotonga, F. W. Platts.

RAROTONGA.

Distant from Auckland, 1,638 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 2,100 ft.; area, 26 square miles; population, 3,064, census, 1916. Rarotonga is the most fertile and valuable of the Cook group, and it has the largest population. The island has been exceptionally favoured by nature, not only with delightful scenic attractions, but also with a remarkably rich and productive soil. The aborigines are very closely akin to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The seat and centre of the government of the Cook Islands—the double township of Avarua and Avatiu—is situated on the north or lee side of the island of Rarotonga, opposite two small openings in the coral reef. The former has the advantage of a boat harbour, where small craft can be moored in safety when the wind is not blowing in from the sea. The residence of the Commissioner is situated here.

The dwellings of the natives are built of coral concrete, as are also the Government offices.

Goods received from the Cook and other annexed islands are now treated as New Zealand produce, and not as imports. The total value of exports from the Cook islands for 1916 was £68,146l., of which £38,647l. represented trade with New Zealand. The principal items were: fresh fruit, £35,612l.; copra, £28,328l.; coffee, £1,280l.; coconuts, £1,280l.

*A full account of these Dependencies will be found in the "New Zealand Official Year Book," 1913, to which the Editors desire to express their acknowledgments.
Revenue and expenditure of the Cook and Northern Islands for the year 1916-17: Revenue, 9,710l.; expenditure, 8,585l.

MANGAIA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 110 miles; circumference, 30 miles; height, 656 ft.; area, 30 square miles; population, 1,245.

Physical Features.

Mangaia is the most southerly island of the Cook group, and is second in importance to Rarotonga.

Coconuts, bananas, oranges, limes, citrons and other fruits grow plentifully.

Resident Agent, J. C. Cameron.

ATIU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 374 ft.; area, 22 square miles; population, 759.

Resident Agent, J. Dyer.

The Island.

Atiu resembles Mangaia in formation, being a raised mass of coral with high jagged cliffs facing the sea.

On the highest point of the central ridge coconuts, bananas, oranges, and coffee grow with the utmost luxuriance; and the kumera, one of the most valuable of South Sea vegetables, yields large crops. The coconut-palm grows well everywhere, but especially so on the coral rock formation.

MAUKE.

Distant from Rarotonga, 151 miles; circumference, 10 miles; height, about 60 ft.; area, 5½ square miles; population, 490.

Mauke is a low circular island about two miles across, lying to the north-east of Rarotonga. Like Mangaia and Atiu, it is surrounded by an unbroken fringing reef. It is marvellously fertile, and produce of considerable value and quantity is exported.

Resident Agent, W. S. Cooper.

MITIABO.

Distant from Rarotonga, 142 miles; circumference, 5 miles; height, about 50 ft.; area, 6 square miles; population, 237.

This island is a good instance of an elevated coral reef, thinly coated with sand and gravel of the same material. The surface is not more than six feet above high-water mark.

Resident Agent, Tou Ariki.

TAKUTEA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area, ½ square mile.

This island was presented to the Crown by the Ariki of Atiu to whom it belonged. It is a coral island, moderately fertile, and will be utilised as a Government plantation.

AITUTAKI.

Distance from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 14½ miles; height, 450 ft.; area, 7 square miles; population, 1,302.

The name includes the island anciently known as "Ara-ura," and some seven or eight smaller islands on the vast barrier reef. Some of these are volcanic, and would seem to have been small peaks on the lip of an extinct volcano, now submerged.

The island itself is pear-shaped, about four miles by two; its highest part being 450 feet high.

Copra is the chief production, and some of the best oranges and pineapples on the market are grown here.

The Aitutakians are naturally a hardy race, and industrious when away from their own homes. They are said to be the best sailors in the Cook group, and their services are much in demand for working the cargo on vessels at Tahiti. They make fans and mats, and are expert at plaiting various fibres for hatmaking.

Resident Agent, T. Duncan, J.P.

MANUAU AND TE AU-O-TU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area of Manuae, 2½ square miles; population 29.

These two small islands are better known as the Hervey Group. They are situated about midway between Atiu and Aitutaki, and are owned by the people of the latter place.

The islands have been leased to Messrs. Bates and Gruning.

NIUE.

Distant from Rarotonga, 590 miles; circumference, 40 miles; height, 200 ft.; area, 100 square miles; population, 3,880, not including 414 natives absent; census, 1916.

Niue, or Savage Island, was placed under a separate administration by an Amending Act of 1903. Is a long, low island, fringed with a misty cloud of fine spray. The shores being too deep and steep to support a barrier reef, the coastline is deprived of its protection. It is fertile, but fresh water is very scarce.

Much of the land is encumbered with a dense scrub of guava bush.

The orange, the coconut, the banana, and other tropical products grow well, and the lemon flourishes on the rocky shores. Recent experiments in cotton growing have been most successful and the product highly reported upon by the British Cotton Growing Association.

The natives of Niue are somewhat different in character from other Polynesians. They are very industrious, and the men are often engaged at Tonga and elsewhere as labourers. The girls and women plait hats, which are exported to New Zealand and Australia. They are keen traders, but are much averse to strangers obtaining a foothold in the island itself.

The exports for 1916 amounted to 3,379l., and the imports to 9,512l. The revenue for 1916-17 was 2,067l., and the expenditure 1,747l. The principal exports were copra, 1,196l., fungus, 1,297l.; and hats, 600l.

Resident Commissioner (vacant).

PALMERSTON ATOLL.

Distant from Rarotonga, 277 miles; area, 1 square mile; population, 90; census, 1916.

The Palmerstons are situated upon an irregular ring of coral reef, measuring outside about four miles and a half by two miles and a half, just awash with the tide. The narrow ring is about half a mile in width, and it supports eight little islets, nearly all covered with coconut palms. The largest of these is little more than half a mile in length and about a quarter of a mile wide.

Copra is the only article of export.

Resident Agent, J. Marsters.

PENRHYN.

Distant 740 miles from Rarotonga; area, 3 square miles; population 326.
This atoll is known to the Polynesians as Tongareva or Ma-ngaro-ngaro and is valuable only by reason of the existence of pearlshell beds in the extensive lagoon. The lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling pearlshell diving have been made.

The coconut crop is considerable. Fresh water is very scarce, and large concrete tanks have been built by the Administration in the various villages for storage of rain water.

Resident Agent, W. Wilson.

Suwarroo.

Distant from Rarotonga, 525 miles; area, ½ square mile.

Suwarroo is an atoll with a splendid lagoon, which produces a very good class of pearlshell. Leased to Capt. Harries, of Rarotonga.

At the time of the census, in October, 1916, there were six native and half-caste labourers employed on the island in addition to one person of British descent.

Manihiki and Rakahanga.

Distant from Rarotonga, 650 and 670 miles respectively; area, each 2 square miles; population, Manihiki, 498; Rakahanga, 296.

Manihiki, or Humphrey, is nearly circular. Bêche-de-mer is obtained from the lagoon. The island occasionally suffers from drought and similar tanks to those at Penrhyn have been erected.

Rakahanga, or Rierson, is also an atoll.

The former has until lately produced a limited amount of pearlshell, but about the end of 1900 it was found that the beds were exhausted by over-fishing. The Manihiki lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling diving made as in the case at Penrhyn.

The only industry is now that of copra-making.

Resident Agent, H. Williams.

Pukapuka, or Danger Island.

Pukapuka is a small solitary atoll about three miles in diameter, which produces pearlshell. It is 720 miles from Rarotonga, and has an area of two square miles. The population is 474 persons.

Education.

The control of education in the Cook Islands has, by the Cook Islands Act, 1915, been placed under the Minister for the Cook Islands. Two schools have been established in Rarotonga, and a third will be opened at the beginning of 1918. A school has also been established at Aitutaki and another at Palmerston. The instruction given is similar to that of the New Zealand State Schools. Technical instruction is being made a special feature.

At Nine Island there is a large school conducted on the same lines.

Trade of Cook Islands.

Oranges and bananas have heretofore been the chief exports, and the latter are being extensively planted. The fruit trade is developing satisfactorily, but it is on the export of copra that dependence must chiefly be placed. Tomatoes are being grown with success and being sent to New Zealand in Winter and Spring.
