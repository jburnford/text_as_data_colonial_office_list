PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the States of Syria and the Lebanon, which are under French Mandate, on the west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian province of Sinai (the boundary running from a point west of Rafa on the Mediterranean to a point two miles to the west of where the thalweg of the Wadi Araba joins the Gulf of Aqaba) and on the east by Trans-Jordan, which included in the area of the Palestine Mandate.

The boundary on the north was determined by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920, (Comd. 1195) and in pursuance of that Convention was delimited between the Mediterranean and El Hammé in 1922. The Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government giving effect to the delimitation is published as Cmd. 1910 (Treaty Series No. 13 (1923)).

The frontier runs from the Mediterranean at Ras al Nakura eastwards to Yarun, thence N.E. to the village of Qadis, thence N.N.E. to Metullah and across the Jordan Valley to Tel Al Qadi (in Palestine) and Banias (in Syria), thence S.S.W. to Jar Banat Yakub, thence southwards along the Jordan to the Lake of Tiberias, thence along the eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias to a point almost due east of the town of Tiberias, thence S.S.E. to El Hammé Station on the Hejaz railway.
The frontier with Trans-Jordan is defined as a line drawn from a point two miles west of Aqaba on the Gulf of Aqaba up the centre of the Wadi Araba, the Dead Sea and the River Jordan to the junction of the latter with the River Yarmuk, thence up the centre of the River Yarmuk to the Syrian frontier.

The Natural Divisions of Palestine.

Palestine comprises four zones of country:

(a) The hill country of Galilee and Judaea,
(b) The five plains, including that lying in the rift of the Jordan Valley, which, from the north of Lake Tiberias to the Dead Sea, is actually below the level of the Mediterranean,
(c) the Beersheba area, different in character and population from the rest of the country,
(d) the desert area.

The five plains are:—The Acre Plain, the Plain of Esdraelon, the Huleh Plain, the Coastal Plain and the Plain of the Jordan.

Geology.

The Hill Country is composed principally of limestone which provides excellent building stone of various colours. Calcareous sandstone abounds along the coast and was used by the Crusaders for their maritime forts and castles (Atlit and Acre); the new Haifa breakwater has been constructed of a similar stone from Atlit. Of metallic minerals, copper ores and important deposits of manganese occur in the southern part of Palestine near the Gulf of Akaba. Petroleum and bitumen exudations are found around the southern part of the Dead Sea. This region and the area westward as far as the Mediterranean Sea is now being explored by Oil Companies. Of non-metallic ore, rock phosphate and bituminous limestone occur in large deposits on the slopes of the Judaean Wilderness. Rock salt occurs in unlimited quantity in the salt dome of Jebel Usdum and has been used for the supply of the Jerusalem market. A sulphur deposit of commercial importance has been located south of Gaza. A good quality of gypsum is found at Menahemiya near Tiberias and impure varieties are found on the slopes of the Judaean Wilderness. Palestine Potash Limited produces potassium chloride and bromine under the Dead Sea Concession, the former being exported to the eastern market and the latter to England.

There are hot springs of medicinal value at Tiberias and El Hamme where modern baths have been established.

Climate.

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude: the coastal region is sub-tropical and humid; the elevated, hilly zone is drier and more temperate, while the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight. The summer months are almost rainless. January and February are, in general, the wettest months and the main rainfall occurs between November and April. The rainfall varies largely, from a minimum of 2½ inches in the south to a maximum of 31 inches in the north.

Water for domestic use is obtained in the larger towns from piped supplies; in the smaller towns and rural districts, from rock cisterns in which rain water is collected or from small springs or wells.

Jerusalem has a piped water supply, pumped partly from a spring about 15 miles south of the town by an installation made by the Military Authorities soon after the occupation, partly from Solomon's Pools, near Bethlehem, by an installation made by the Civil Administration, and partly from the springs of Ain Fara, Ain Fawar and Wadi el Qilt by works constructed by the Municipality in 1926, 1931 and 1932.

In 1933 owing to the very poor rainfall in the previous winter, the springs of Arrub, Solomon's Pools and Ain Fawar totally failed.

The water supply is now obtained actually from Ain Fara and Wadi Qilt and approximately 450,000 gallons per day are pumped to Jerusalem from these sources.

In 1932-33 a new Town Service Reservoir was built, with a capacity of 2,200,000 gallons.

Considerable progress has been made towards the eradication of malaria, formerly so prevalent, by Government distribution of quinine in villages, oiling of wells and cisterns, provision of pumps, and drainage of swamps.

The country is relatively free from epidemic disease.

Government.

Under Turkish rule, part of Palestine was in the Vilayet (Province) of Beirut and part in the Sandjak (District) of Jerusalem. After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British forces, the country remained under British Military Administration until July, 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a Civil Administration set up.

By the Treaty of Peace, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey renounced all rights over Palestine. The Principal Allied Powers had selected His Britannic Majesty as Mandatory at the Conference at San Remo, on 26th April, 1920. The terms of the Mandate were approved by the Council of the League of Nations on the 24th July, 1922, and the Mandate came into force on September 29th, 1923. The Mandatory is responsible, inter alia, for carrying into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd, 1917, viz.:—"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

On the 1st September, 1922, a Constitution was promulgated.

Under this Constitution Palestine is governed by a High Commissioner, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, assisted by an Executive Council consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Treasurer; and by an Advisory Council consisting of heads of certain Departments.

An attempt was made in 1923 to create the Legislative Council provided for in the Constitution, but owing to the refusal of the Arabs to take part in the elections, it was replaced by the Advisory Council in order to secure the enactment of legislation until such time as a Legislative Council is created.

English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

In 1921, a Supreme Moslem Council was constituted in order to control and manage Moslem Awqaf and Sharia Courts in Palestine. It consists of a President known also as Rais-Al-Ulema, and four members elected by secondary electors, who again are elected by all male Palestinian Moslems over 20 years of age. The Council nominates for approval by Government the officers of the Sharia Courts and appoints the Awqaf officers.

The Council has established a Moslem Orphanage in Jerusalem, and has carried out important repairs of sacred buildings and extensive tree planting on Waqf land and in Moslem cemeteries.
Regulations were made under the Religious Communities Ordinance, 1926, by the High Commissioner in 1927 for the organisation of the Jewish Community in Palestine. The Jewish community, like the Moslem and the various Christian communities enjoys autonomy in the administration of its internal affairs, religious cultural and communal; it has also power to levy rates on its members. The organs of the community are a Chief Rabbiinate and local Rabbinical officers, an Elected Assembly, a General Council which is elected by the Assembly, and represents the community in its dealings with the Government, and local communities.

Complete freedom in their communal affairs is allowed to those Jewish congregations who have exercised the option to remain outside the recognised community.

The Jewish Agency is recognized as the representative body of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish National Home; it is represented in Palestine by an Executive whose headquarters are at Jerusalem.

The Palestine Government has maintained in force the status and privileges accorded to the different Christian Communities under the Ottoman regime.

The affairs of the larger towns are administered by Municipal Councils presided over by Mayors. In smaller towns and large villages Local Councils have been set up.

A Central Town Planning Commission supervises the activities of local town planning commissions with the object of securing the proper development of urban areas.

Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into three districts—the Jerusalem, Northern and Southern Districts—each administered by a District Commissioner.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is nearly 10,000 square miles in extent.

The population of this territory taken by Census on November 18th, 1931, was 1,035,821, of which number 387,525 were living in 23 towns and large villages and 66,553 were nomad bedouins. An estimate of the settled population at 30.6.33 based on natural increase and excess of immigration is 1,038,331 of whom 723,427 are Moslems, 209,207 Jews, 95,168 Christians and 10,532 persons of other denominations or of no religious confession. To this must be added the nomad bedouin population (Moslem) about whom no figures are available except those given in the Census of 1931 (66,553). The chief town, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1517, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917. Its population in 1931 was 90,503. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large numbers of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The site of Solomon's Temple is occupied by the Dome of the Rock, which contains a relic of Muhammad and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham. Bethlehem, the scene of Christ's Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity, at the east end of the present village, is said to be the oldest Christian church in existence.

The population figures of the other principal towns at the date of the Census (18.11.31) were:

- Jaffa, 51,866; Tel-Aviv, 46,101; Haifa, 50,403; Gaza, 17,046; Nazareth, 8,758; Nablus, 17,189; Safad, 9,441; Tiberias, 8,601; Hebron, 17,531; Ramle, 10,347; Bethlehem, 6,814; Lydda, 11,250; Acre, 7,897.

An approximate estimate of the present population of the largest towns is as follows:

- Jerusalem, 95,000; Jaffa, 58,000; Tel-Aviv, 60,000; Haifa, 60,000; Nablus, 18,000; Gaza, 18,000; Hebron, 18,000.

Jewish Colonisation.

The total Jewish population of Palestine is estimated to be 210,000. Jewish agricultural settlements number 125 and have a population of over 60,000. Sixty-one of them are built on the land of the Jewish National Fund, established by the Zionist Organisation for the purpose of acquiring land to remain the property of the Jewish people. (The total possessions of the Jewish National Fund now amount to 320,000 metric dunams.) These settlements have been equipped and financed by the Keren Hayesod, the Colonisation Fund of the Jewish Agency.

Extensive colonisation work has been performed by the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association, which took over colonies established by Baron Edmond de Rothschild and established new settlements, the total being about 30.

A number of settlements have been founded on the land acquired by the American Zion Commonwealth and on tracts purchased by private individuals. The total area in Jewish possession is now over 1,200,000 metric dunams, of which 125,000 are planted with oranges.

The Jewish urban population is approximately 160,000, its main centres being:—Jerusalem and suburbs 57,000, Tel-Aviv (a purely Jewish city) 60,000, Haifa 23,000, and Jaffa 8,000. There are about 3,100 Jewish factories and workshops employing 17,000 workers and representing a total capital investment of £P.4,500,000, with a total annual output of £P.3,600,000.

The local affairs of the smaller Jewish settlements are controlled by Vaads or Councils elected by the male and female residents who own registered holdings or pay taxes.

Education.

The approximate number of children in Palestine between the ages of 3 and 18 years was in 1931 307,000, of whom 231,000 were Moslems, 49,000 Jews and 27,000 Christians. The number of children who attended school in 1931–32 was 85,672, including 33,100 Moslems, 35,228 Jews, 16,760 Christians and 584 Druzes and Bahais.

The Arab Public System of Education, maintained by Government, embraced in that school year 305 schools with 24,837 pupils, the great majority of whom were Moslems. These schools included 2 Teachers' Training Colleges with 78 men and 63 women students, and 10 schools with 20 secondary classes containing 248 secondary pupils. The Kadoorie Agricultural School at Tulkarm had 40 boarders. This school also provides agricultural training for teachers in rural schools. Technical education is provided in most of the larger schools. The Law School in Jerusalem had 99 students.

The Jewish and Christian Communities provide, the former almost entirely and the latter to a very large extent, for the education of their own children.

The Hebrew Public System, controlled by the Jewish Agency, embraced 256 schools with 22,436 pupils. These included 4 Teachers' Training Colleges, with 133 men and 240 women students, and 6 schools with 26 secondary classes containing 863 secondary pupils. There were also 111 private Jewish schools with 11,970 pupils, including 10 secondary schools with 584 pupils.

There were 5 agricultural schools with 610 pupils, 2 junior technical schools with 80 students and a
Technical Institute at Haifa with 130 students. The Hebrew University at Jerusalem had 150 students and 64 auditors.

The Christian schools, maintained by various foreign and religious bodies, numbered 151, with 17,183 pupils. 31 of these schools had secondary classes, with 995 pupils; the 3 agricultural schools had 82 pupils. There were about 50 schools from which Attendance Returns were not received; the number of pupils in these schools was estimated at 2,500.

There were 38 private Moslem schools maintained by local communities and associations, with 4,302 boys and 910 girls. There were also 119 kuttabes, 28 in towns and 91 in villages. These provided for 3,984 children, of whom 260 were girls.

In 1932-33, the Arab Public System embraced 306 schools with 24,837 pupils and the Hebrew Public System, which was transferred in that year to the Jewish Community of Palestine (Knesseth Israel), embraced 267 schools with 24,400 pupils. The complete statistical returns for 1932-33 have not yet been completed.

Some non-Government schools receive a capitulation grant-in-aid from the Department of Education, conditional on the acceptance of a certain measure of Government supervision and inspection. A block grant of £P.20,000 a year is made to the Jewish Community (Knesseth Israel) for its schools.

The Palestine Board of Higher Studies was established in 1924. The Government and many educational institutions are represented on it. It conducts the Palestine Matriculation Examination and the Palestine Diploma Examinations, both of which are public examinations recognised by Government. The Palestine Matriculation Examination is recognised by many British Universities.

Justice.

The Courts in Palestine are either civil or religious courts. The former have jurisdiction over local subjects in all matters save those of personal status and Waqfs (charitable endowments), and over foreign subjects in all matters, subject to the provisions mentioned below.

There is a Magistrate's Court in every sub-district, and, in the larger towns, such as Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, two or more such courts. The Magistrates are for the most part Palestinian and have jurisdiction in first instance in minor criminal cases for which the punishment is not more than one year's imprisonment or a fine of a hundred pounds or both, and in civil cases where the value of the subject-matter does not exceed £P.100. They also have jurisdiction in actions for the recovery of the possession of land.

There are four District Courts, each composed of a British President and two Palestinian judges. They serve respectively the sub-districts of Jerusalem, Hebron and Beersheba, Jaffa and Gaza, Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarm and Nazareth, and Haifa, Acre, Tiberias and Safad. They go on circuit within the area of their jurisdiction. A District Court has jurisdiction in first instance over all crimes except those punishable with death and in all civil cases outside the jurisdiction of a Magistrate. It also hears appeals from the decisions of Magistrates both in civil and in criminal cases, except in cases for the recovery of the possession of land. Crimes punishable with death are tried by a Court of Criminal Assize composed of the Chief Justice or Senior Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court sitting with the District Court.

In each district, in addition to the District Court, there is a Land Court, composed of the President of the District Court and a Palestinian judge of that court, which hears all cases in which the ownership of land is in issue.

The highest court in Palestine is the Supreme Court which is composed of a British Chief Justice and one other British judge and four Palestinian judges. The court sits in two capacities:

(1) As a Court of Appeal, in which capacity it has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters decided in first instance by the District Courts, the Land Courts and the Court of Criminal Assize;

(2) As a High Court of Justice, in which capacity it hears applications of the nature of habeas corpus and mandamus proceedings.

Each division of the Court of Appeal is composed normally of three judges, while the High Court may sit with two judges. In either case a British judge presides. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court in civil cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council where the value of the suit exceeds £500.

The Chief Justice of Palestine is ex officio President of the Full Court of Appeal of Egypt.

Special arrangements exist in the Beersheba sub-district, where minor cases are disposed of according to tribal custom by the Court of Sheikhs. The District Court of Jerusalem visits Beersheba every month to hear appeals from the local courts and to try more serious criminal cases.

All matters of personal status affecting Moslems are within the jurisdiction of the Sharia Courts. A Sharia Court consists of a Kadi, and appeals from his decision lie to the Moslem Court of Appeal, which is composed of a President and two members.

Jewish Religious Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters of personal status of Jews, and jurisdiction by consent in other matters. An appeal from the decision of the Jewish Religious Courts lies to the Rabbincal Council.

The different Christian communities (such as the Latin and Orthodox) have similar jurisdiction to that of the Jewish Courts.

Special provisions exist with regard to the trial of foreigners. The general effect of these rules is that where a foreign subject is charged with an offence other than a petty offence, he may claim to be tried by a British magistrate or by a court containing a majority of British judges. In the Court of Appeal he can claim a majority of British judges and in matters of personal status that the action be heard by the British President.

Security.

The Police establishment in December, 1932, was 146 Officers (including 57 British Officers) and 2,464 other ranks (including 650 British N.C.O.'s and Constables). 1,495 serious offences against property were reported in 1932, and six death sentences were carried out.

There are Central Prisons in Jerusalem and Acre for long-term prisoners, and a Female Prison in Bethlehem. There are also two Jail Labour Companies of approximately 350 each, the prisoners of which are employed on public works.

The garrison in Palestine and Trans-Jordan in 1933 consisted of the following units:

Air Headquarters Palestine and Trans-Jordan (Jerusalem), which administers the following Army, Royal Air Force and Trans-Jordan Frontier Force units:

Army:
Two Battalions of Infantry, one stationed at Jerusalem and one at Haifa.
One W/T Company, Royal Corps of Signals.
One Company, R.A.S.C.
R.A.S.C. Supply Depot (Sarafand).
Detachment R.A.S.C.
The yields of the main crops in 1931 to 1933 were:

| Crop          | 1931 Metric tons | 1932 Metric tons | 1933 Metric tons |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Wheat         | 79,650           | 53,100           | 44,447           |

| Lentils       | 3,758            | 2,500            | 1,547            |
| Olives        | 33,906           | 5,100            | 2,612            |
| Citrus Fruits (cases) | 2,468,937 | 3,734,566 | 4,226,665 |
| (Exports)     |                  |                  |                  |

In 1932 there were in Palestine:

- Horses: 14,100
- Mules: 5,599
- Donkeys: 74,177
- Camels: 32,317
- Cattle: 167,501
- Sheep: 247,689
- Goats: 380,608
- Poultry: 1,172,047

Thirteen Government forests nurseries were maintained during 1932 and produced approximately 1 million forest plants. Planting, begun in 1930, is being considerably extended. By the end of 1932 Government had planted 4,000 acres. Special attention is being given to the reclamation of sand dunes.

Nearly 172,000 acres of state forests have been reserved.

Government Agricultural and Horticultural Experiment Stations have been organised at Acre, Beisan, Nablus, Jerusalem, Jericho, Sarafand, Farradiheh (near Safad) and Majdal (near Gaza). The Acre Station also includes a Stud Farm.

Customs.

The Customs Tariff, which is non-differential, is fixed partly on a specific and partly on an ad valorem basis: 60% of imports pay specific charges, principally petrol, kerosene, sugar, rice, coffee, wheat, flour, leaf tobacco, cigarettes, wood and timber for building, rubber tyres and tubes, boots and shoes. Ad valorem duties are levied on silk (20%), and woollen (12%) goods and motor-cars (25%).

The revenue from import duties in 1932 was £1,169,924.

19-98% of imports came from the United Kingdom, 2-80% from other parts of the British Empire, 16% from Egypt, 10-47% from Syria, 9-98% from Germany and 6-88% from Roumania.

Exports to the United Kingdom constituted 56-36% of the total in 1932, to other parts of the British Empire 3-36%, to Germany 13-97%, to Syria 9-65% and to Egypt 5-41%.

Shipping and Communications.

The chief ports of Palestine are Haifa and Jaffa. The new harbour at Haifa, started in 1929, was completed in 1933, and adequate facilities for ordinary passenger and cargo vessels, both at moorings and alongside the new quays with transit sheds, road, railway and other services, have been provided.

Acre and Jaffa are also ports of entry, but their trade is small and is carried mainly by sailing vessels.

The following are the principal shipping lines which call at Haifa and Jaffa:

- Lloyd Triestino, Servizi Maritimi, Messageries Maritimes, Fabre Prince, Moss, American Export, Deutsche Levante. Tourist steamers of various lines call at Haifa during February, March and April.
In 1932, 974 steamers, totalling 2,003,111 tons, and 1,969 sailing vessels, totalling 55,194 tons, called at Palestine ports.

Palestine possesses no shipping of its own, other than small sailing vessels and power launches.

Postal despatches are exchanged daily (in some cases thrice daily) between all principal towns. There is also a daily exchange of despatches with Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan. Direct mails for Great Britain are despatched thrice weekly by ordinary mail and thrice weekly by air mail.

There is a bi-weekly overland desert mail service with Iraq and Persia, via Amman.

Imperial Airways have an aerodrome at Gaza which is used in connection with the air mail services to and from Great Britain, Iraq and India.

All the principal towns are connected by telegraph and telephone. There is direct telegraphic communication with Cyprus, Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan, and a trunk telephone service with Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan. The trunk service with Egypt affords radio-telephonic facilities with Great Britain, certain other countries in Europe, Australia, America, India and South Africa.

In 1932 there were conveyed 12,389,400 letters, 918,700 postcards, 6,446,700 printed communications and samples, 135,491 parcels, 262,600 telegrams were transmitted. Total length of main telegraph and telephone lines, 13,656 kilometres; local lines, 16,881 kilometres. Number of telephone subscribers 3,300; telephone instruments in use, 5,248.

The total length of the Palestine Railways, including branch lines and sidings, is approximately 714½ miles, as follows:

| Standard Gauge (4' 8½") |
|-------------------------|
| Kantara-Rafa            | 139 |
| Rafa-Haifa              | 183½ |
| Jaffa-Jerusalem         | 60 |
| Es Safriya-Sarafand     | 34 |
| Kafr Jinis-Beit Nabala Quarry Siding | 3½ |
| Ras El Ein-Petah Tiqva Line | 5½ |

105 c/m. Gauge—Hejaz Railway.

| Haifa-Samakh           | 72 |
| Nassib-Ma'an           | 207 |
| Haifa (Kilo. 2) to Acre | 14 |
| Nablus-Tulkarm         | 25½ |

714½

The Kantara-Rafa Section is operated by the Palestine Railways on behalf of His Majesty's Government.

There is through communication with Egypt, and trains connect at Kantara West daily with Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Suez and other parts of Egypt. Goods vehicles are sent across the canal by means of a truck transporter.

Sentinel-Cammell Steam Rail Cars are in use on the Haifa-Lydda-Khan Yunis, Haifa-Acre and Haifa-Samakh Sections.

East of Haifa the Palestine Railways Administration extends to Ma'an in Trans-Jordan, but with a break between Samakh and Nassib which is operated by the Chemins de fer de Hijaz authorities.

There are 590 miles of metalled roads in Palestine open for traffic throughout the year which are extensively used by motor transport, and in addition, many hundreds of miles of tracks passable for wheeled traffic of all kinds during dry weather.

Banking, Co-operatives and Currency.

The most important bank in Palestine is Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Nazareth, Nablus and an agency at Acre. The Anglo-Palestine Bank has its head office in Jerusalem with branches at Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad, Petah Tikvah and an agency at Rehovoth. In addition there are branches in Jerusalem of the Ottoman Bank (also in Haifa, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Nablus and Amman), and the Banco di Roma (also in Jaffa, Haifa and Tel-Aviv). There is a Workers' Bank at Tel-Aviv and Banks have been established for granting building loans to Co-operative Societies.

The Co-operative movement is extensively established among the Jewish population, both urban and rural. There is a Registrar of Co-operative Societies whose duties include the encouragement of the growth of a similar movement among the Arab farmers.

A Currency Board was appointed in London in 1926 in order to introduce and control a Palestine currency based on the pound sterling; and the new currency was issued on the 1st November, 1927, under the authority of an Order of His Majesty in Council dated the 7th of February, 1927.

The standard of currency is the Palestine pound divided into 1,000 mils. The Palestine Currency Order provides for a gold coin of one Palestine pound containing 123.27447 grains of standard gold (the equivalent of the English sovereign). It is not intended at present to introduce gold coins. The Currency Board has issued silver coins of 100 and 50 mils, nickel bronze coins of 20, 10 and 5 mils, bronze coins of 2 and 1 mils, and currency notes of £P.100, £P.50, £P.10, £P.5, £P.1 and 500 mils. The currency notes are legal tender for the amounts expressed therein. Silver coins are legal tender for the payment of £P.2; nickel bronze coins of 20 and 10 mils are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 200 mils, and coins of lower denomination are legal tender for an amount not exceeding 100 mils. The amount of Palestine currency in circulation at the 31st August, 1933, was:—Coins, £P.369,800; notes, £P.2,896,864.

The metric system is followed by the Government and local authorities, but the use of local weights and measures is still permitted for the general public.

Antiquities.

The Administration of the Antiquities Service in Palestine is controlled by the Department of Antiquities, working under the Antiquities Ordinance (1929) and Regulations (1930-32). During 1932, twenty licences to excavate or make soundings were issued. The results of the Department's research work, together with summaries of the results of licensed excavations conducted by non-Government bodies, are published in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. (Published by Mr. Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, London, E.C.4.)

The Palestine Archaeological Museum, built with funds made available by Mr. John D. Rockefeller Junior, is in course of construction.

For further information on all the above subjects see the "Handbook of Palestine" (Luke, H. C. and Keith-Rowe, E.), published in 1930 by Macmillan and Co., and issued under the authority of the Government of Palestine, the Annual Blue Books of the Palestine Government, obtainable from the Superintendent of Printing and Stationery, Jerusalem, and the Annual Reports on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, published by His Majesty's Stationery Office.
