**TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.**

**Situation and Area.**

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. The area is about 168 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 64 miles long and 1 mile broad. According to the census of 1921 Grand Turk contains 1,568 inhabitants, being one third of the total population which in 1921 was 5,612. The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

**History.**

These Islands were discovered in 1512 by Ponce de Leon, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas. In 1873 they were annexed to Jamaica and still remain one of its dependencies.

Two hurricanes passed over these Islands in 1926 on July 24th and September 16th respectively and did great damage. The second one was the most disastrous, as regards damage to property, in the history of the Dependency.

Another hurricane passed over these Islands on September 14th, 1928, which did considerable damage and caused the loss of 17 lives.

**Industries, Trade and Customs.**

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the average quantity annually gathered being about 1,600,000 bushels, equal to 56,000 tons. 577,494 bushels were exported in 1926.

*For Grand Cayman only. Records for the other Islands are not available.*
valued at 10,137l. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1932, 23,261 lbs., was valued at 2,417l. 744,100 dried conchs (shell fish), valued at 744l. 343 lbs. turtle shell valued at 341l. 43 tons lignum vitae valued at 64l. 3445 lbs. shark skins valued at 64l.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st Dec., 1932, 55 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,217 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

The bulk of the imports (10,518l. in 1932 out of a total of 21,942l.) are from the U.S. of America. The exports are chiefly to Canada and the United States.

An ad valorem customs duty of 15% is levied on most imports and specific duties on alcoholic liquors, tobacco, flour and a few other articles.

The British preferential tariff is 10%.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 78°, the extreme range being from 60° to 93°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1932 amounted to 51.69 inches, the average rainfall during the five years 1928-1932 was 36.11 inches.

Means of Communication.

There is a mail, passenger, and freight service between New York and Grand Turk about twice a month by steamers of the Royal Netherlands West India Mail, and also between Jamaica and Turks Islands once a month by sailing vessel.

The Elders and Fyffes Line make occasional calls on their way to Jamaica when passengers offer and on such occasions take mails to Jamaica.

The rate of letter postage is 2d. per ounce to all British Possessions; 2½d. to the U.S.A., and to all other countries 3d. per ounce.

There are no railways in these Islands.

Internal mails are carried between the several islands by small sailing-craft engaged in local trade.

Mails to and from England and other parts of the world are dispatched and received via New York.

Grand Turk is an important cable junction, there being cables to Jamaica, to Barbados and to Bermuda.

The Government radio-telegraph system provides service between Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour, and Salt Cay, and with ships at sea within short range.

There is a public telephone service at Grand Turk.

Education.

There are eleven elementary schools supported by Government, with 843 pupils enrolled in 1932 and an average attendance of 551. The schools are entirely unsectarian and free.

There is a Government Secondary School at Grand Turk.

Cambridge Local Examinations are held annually at Grand Turk.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahamas Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of five shillings, ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1932, 859 depositors, with 13,285l. deposits.

Constitution.

By Jamaica Law No. 6 of 1926 which came into operation on the 1st day of August 1926, the Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner, who by virtue of his office is President, and seven other persons, three of whom are holders of offices under the Crown, appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.

KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the East African coastline from Umba River to Dick's Head, and territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a Commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew in 1893.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays a rent of 10,000l. per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the latter has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 224,960 square miles.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into nine Provinces.

1. The Nyanza Province comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho, and Kisumu-Londiani.
2. The Nzoia Province comprising the districts of Nandi, Usain Gishu, Elgeyo, Marakwet, and Trans Nzoia.
3. The Turkana Province comprising the districts of North and South Turkana and West Suk.
4. The Rift Valley Province comprising the district of Nakuru, Ravine, Baringo, Naivasha, and Laikipia.
5. The Masai Province comprising the district of Narok and Kajiado.
