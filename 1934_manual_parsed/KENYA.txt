KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the East African coast line from the River to Dick's Head, and territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention. The eastern boundary was defined along the north-east by an agreement with Italy (1) and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a Commission was appointed to define the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. The west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1899, March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew in 1893.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., extending 10 miles inland along the coast, the Tanganyika mandated Territory from Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays £10,000 per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief, who was transferred in 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The boundaries were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the boundary has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Court Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were reclassified as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 224,960 square miles.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into five Provinces.

1. The Nyanza Province comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho, and Kisumu-Londiani.
2. The Nzoia Province comprising the districts of Nandi, Usain Gishu, Elgeyo, Marakwet, and Trans-Nzoia.
3. The Turkana Province comprising the districts of North and South Turkana and West Suk.
4. The Rift Valley Province comprising the districts of Nakuru, Ravine, Baringo, Naivasha, and Laikipia.
5. The Masai Province comprising the district of Narok and Kajiado.
6. The Kikuyu Province comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kyambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, North Nyeri, Embu, and Meru.

7. The Uhamba Province comprising the districts of Machakos, Kitui, and Taifa.

8. The Coast Province comprising the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, and Lamu.

9. The Northern Frontier Province comprising the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir, and Telemugger.

The Capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is also the largest centre in the Colony. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1932 | 90,727     |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 64,894, of whom about 1,023 are Europeans. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours, Mombasa harbour on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the port. A Municipality was established at Mombasa in 1928.

**Population.**

The total population is estimated at 3,076,343. A census of the non-native population taken in March, 1931, showed a population as follows:

| Group          | Population |
|----------------|------------|
| Europeans      | 16,812     |
| Indians        | 39,644     |
| Arabs          | 12,166     |
| Goans          | 3,979      |
| Other non-natives | 1,346    |
| Africans (estimated) | 2,966,993 |
| **Total**      | **3,040,940** |

On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Lumbwa, the Suk, the Turkana, the Massai, the Somalis, and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made some progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

**Constitution.**

Under the Royal Instructions dated the 11th September, 1920, as amended by Additional Instructions dated the 7th July, 1928, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner, Commissioner for Local Government, Lands and Settlement, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, the Director of Agriculture, and Director of Education (ex officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, eleven ex officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, and one nominated unofficial member to represent the interests of the African community. Under royal instructions dated the 28th March, 1927, it was provided that if at any time the number of Indian elected members is less than five the vacancy or vacancies so arising might be filled by the appointment of nominated Indian unofficial members. The ex officio members are to be the ex officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate forms one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

**East Africa Governors' Conference.**

In pursuance of a recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission which visited E. Africa in 1924, a first Conference of Governors of the British East African Dependencies was held in Nairobi in January and February, 1928, for the discussion of matters of mutual concern. It was then decided that a permanent Secretariat for the Conference should be established at Nairobi and conferences held as and when necessary. Subsequently the Joint Select Committee on Closer Union in East Africa recommended that the machinery of the Governors' Conference should be increasingly utilised for the purpose of ensuring continuous and effective cooperation and co-ordination in all matters of common interest to East Africa. As a result of this, it was decided that the Conference should be deemed to be in permanent session with a view to its being convened at any time when necessary, and that there should in any case be an annual meeting of the Governors of Kenya, Tanganyika Territory and Uganda, attended, if desired, by the Governors of Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and the British Resident, Zanzibar. The cost of the Secretariat is

*Includes part of Kyambu and Fort Hall.*
contributed in varying proportions by the East African Governments and by the Kenya and Uganda Railway Administration. The Secretary of the Conference is Colonel C. W. G. Walker, C.M.G., D.S.O., who is also Secretary to the High Commissioner for Transport, Kenya and Uganda. Salary £1,500.

Climate.

For purposes of rainfall Kenya may be divided into three parts:

1. Northern Desert area where there is usually less than 20 inches a year.
2. The coastal strip and the Nyanza and Kikuyu Provinces where there may be from 40 to 80 inches a year, and
3. The remainder of Kenya where rainfall is from 20 to 40 inches a year. On the Coast there is usually a single rainy season from April to November, but up-country there are generally "long" rains from April to June, and "short" rains from October to December. The Coastal regions have a tropical climate though nights are cool except during the hottest months from December to April. In the Highlands the climate is invigorating with cool breezes; at Nairobi the mean maximum shade temperature in 1931 was 73.1°F., and the mean minimum 64.9°F. The rainfall at Nairobi was 45.69 inches.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at 1s. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw from circulation the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a rupee) have been withdrawn from circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a shilling) have been introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Treasurer.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26, Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret, and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe, and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Kitale in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) with which is amalgamated The National Bank of South Africa Ltd., has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kitale and Eldoret, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Land and Products.

As the pursuit of agriculture is possible from sea level to altitudes of over 9,000 feet, climatic conditions are extremely varied and tropical, sub-tropical and temperate crops are grown.

Considerable quantities of hides are exported from all parts of the Colony, but the principal producing areas developed at present are at elevations of 4,000 feet and over.

In the highlands coffee, maize, wattle, tea, wheat and potatoes are the principal crops and in the lower parts of the Colony, including the Coast, sisal, maize, coconuts, cotton, sugar cane and miscellaneous grains and oil seeds are grown.

Exports of agricultural commodities in 1932 were valued at £1,967,730.

Whereas considerable quantities of foodstuffs for the non-native population were imported in former years most of these have now been replaced by home-grown supplies.

Extensive pasture grounds exist throughout the highlands and maintain considerable herds of grade and native stock. The dairy industry under European supervision is in a thriving condition. Butter and cheese are prepared, and increased supplies of the former are being exported.

Fishing industries are established on the Coast and Lake Victoria and provide valuable supplies for local consumption.

The forest products of the Coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony, and gum copal. The highland forests contain large quantities of pencil Cedar and several other good timbers such as podocarpus, Olive, and East African Camphor, also large areas of bamboo suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.

A geological survey was inaugurated during the year and the following minerals were located:

Gold has been found throughout the Nyanza Province and in the southern part of the Masai Reserve.

Silver is commonly associated with the gold discoveries.

Copper occurs in the north-eastern part of the Ukambani Reserve.

Lead and Zinc are found in the Coastal Province.

Asbestos is being exploited near Sultan Hamud and a local industry developed.

Arsenic occurs in the form of arsenical pyrites in the Nyanza Province.

Barite is found in the Coastal Province.

Diatomite is found near Gilgil and in many other parts where lacustrine beds occur.

Gypsum has been discovered near Simba.

Iron Magnetite-quartzites occur in the Basement Complex and form a possible ore for the future.

Ilmenite (Titanium). The sand is abundantly concentrated in the rivers of the Nyanza Province.

Limestone. Abundant supplies are found near Voi, Kajiado, Loldaika and in the Suk country.

Mica. "Kunkar" is worked south of the Kavirondo Gulf, Suk and Ukambani Reserve.

Olivine is concentrated in the rivers draining the Aberdares.

Potash and Soda. These salts are being exploited at Lake Magadi.

Tin. Cassiterite has been discovered in the Trans-Nzoia.

Zircon is an abundant constituent in the river beds of Nyanza but is particularly plentiful in the streams draining the Coastal ranges.

The total area of land alienated as at December 31st, 1932, was 6,772,490 acres. In addition, there are 387,120 acres of Township and Government Reserves. Sale of leases of land by public auction has been resumed.
Trade, Customs and Excise.

Under the terms of the Congo Basin Treaties' equality of treatment in respect of imported goods irrespective of origin is ensured, and the grant of Imperial Preference is therefore inadmissible. Goods declared as in transit are allowed to be imported and forwarded under Customs control on payment of expenses of administration (6d. per package).

For purposes of Customs, Kenya and Uganda form a single unit and by agreement with the Tanganyika Territory Government a common Tariff has been accepted by the three territories, the free and unrestricted movement within the territories of both imported goods and local products being thus secured. The Common Tariff, however, includes a small number of "suspended duties" which are of a protective nature and may be imposed by Proclamation either in part or in full in any or all of the territories.

The general duty rating under the Common Tariff is 20 per cent. ad valorem based on the landed value at the port of entry, building materials, artisans' tools, and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on such articles as readily lend themselves to this form of assessment and in certain cases alternative specific or ad valorem charges are levied. Exemption from duty is allowed on drugs and medicines, packing materials, disinfectants, germicides and vermin killers, machinery, and many articles necessary for road construction, sanitation, irrigation and drainage purposes, and for the agricultural, industrial, and educational development of the territories.

Amendments to the Customs Tariff in 1932 were of a minor character, being confined to a reduction in the duty on currants from 20% ad valorem to Shs. 1.75 per 100 lbs. and to the insertion of authority to the Commissioner of Customs to compute for purposes of assessment of duty, the freight on goods conveyed by air at a figure not less than one-fourth of the sum actually charged.

Excise duties are imposed on locally manufactured sugar (£1 per ton), tea (10 cents per lb.), cigarettes and cigars (75 cents per lb.), tobacco (50 cents per lb.), and beer (£2 per standard barrel), the revenue derived from these duties being allocated to the consuming territory as is the case with Customs collections.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of Trade Imports (excluding imports on Government Account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya Ports were as follows:

| Year | Trade Imports | Total Customs Receipts | Tonnage entered, Net |

Communications.

The Union Castle Line and the British India Steam Navigation Co. maintain a monthly service of passenger steamers from and to London. The Union Castle vessels run either via the Cape or Suez.

The Messageries Maritimes from Marseilles to Madagascar call fortnightly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards.

The Tirrenia have two lines calling monthly; one steamer running as far as Zanzibar, and back to Genoa, and the other as far as Durban, and also back to Genoa, calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland.

The Navigazione Libera Triestina Line also maintains a north and south service with Italian ports.

The Clan Ellerman Harrison Line maintains a three-weekly service of fast cargo steamers from Liverpool; also a service from the U.S.A. and Canada.
The Holland Afrika Line maintains a fortnightly service from London and continental ports to South and East Africa calling at this Port.

The Deutsche Ost Afrika Line maintains a three-weekly passenger and cargo service between Mombasa, Continental ports and Southampton.

The Osaka Shosen Kaisha Line connect monthly with Japan.

A fortnightly Mail Service to Bombay and Durban is maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company's passenger and cargo steamers. The North bound ships connect at Bombay with the P. & O. mail steamers to England.

A monthly passenger service is maintained with Batavia via southern ports by the Royal Packet Company of Holland.

Communication between the coastal ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co. & Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw Bros.

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by an Inter-Colonial Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Territory (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On the 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda. It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the Governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway. The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory's representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

The length of the line, which is metre gauge, including branches open to traffic at the end of 1932, is 1,627 miles, excluding loops and industrial sidings.

The Railway Marine consists of the Lake Victoria, Lake Kioga, Lake Albert, and River Nile flotillas. Their respective strengths are as follows:

- **Lake Victoria**, 5 Steamers, total displacement 5346 tons.
  - 4 Tugs and 1 Launch.
  - 1 motor vessel (Kagera River Service).
  - 35 Lighters, total capacity 8830 tons.

- **Lake Kioga**, 3 Sternwheel Steamers.
  - 1 Launch.
  - 19 Lighters, total capacity 1900 tons.

- **Lake Albert** and River Nile 4 Steamers and 3 Lighters.

The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda:

Total Expenditure on Capital Account at the end of 1932: 22,219,141.

Revenue for 1932—

| Railways | 1,838,661 |
| Harbours | 282,354 |

Ordinary Working Expenditure excluding Loan and Redemption Charges, for 1932—

| Railways | 1,044,161 |
| Harbours | 125,224 |

No. of Passengers carried: 558,492.

Goods carried (Revenue earning) Tons: 726,154.

Total Steamer Mileages (all three services): 149,506.

In 1927 the title of the Kenya and Uganda Railway was changed to that of Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and the Administration assumed control of the working of the Port of Mombasa and coastal ports.

The old harbour at Mombasa is now entirely used by dhows. Kilindini Harbour has been the scene of intensive development during the last eight years, and some £1 million pounds sterling have been expended there. There is now, in addition to the former lightercraft quay, a deep-water quay having a length of approximately 3,000 feet. This quay can accommodate six ships alongside of the normal type using the port. The quay is served by 25 electric level-luffing cranes and there are five transit sheds, three of which are double storey. The total number of quay, shed and stacking ground cranes are 82 up to date. A jetty at which bulk oil ships discharge to tanks ashore has just been brought into use. A Harbour Advisory Board advises the High Commissioner for Transport on Port Matters.

Kilindini Harbour, at the Port of Mombasa is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana, which is navigable for about 400 miles by small shallow draft steamers. The bar at Kipini is an obstacle to navigation from the sea.

The Port of Kilifi consists of a land-locked Harbour, 30 miles North-East of Mombasa. It offers good anchorage for small vessels, and opens out into the Bandari Ya Walli, a bay about one-and-half miles wide, with shallow anchorage.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Kilifi.

The Port of Malindi is an open Harbour, 60 miles North East of Mombasa. Ships of any size can anchor off Malindi, but the anchorage is very exposed to the Monsoons. Cotton, Sim sim, and Copra are exported.

A District Officer resides at Malindi.

About three miles North of Malindi is the mouth of the Sabaki River. This river, which has recently been bridged about a mile from its mouth, passes through a country of great fertility, but is shallow and only navigable by canoes.

The Port of Lamu lies between Lamu and Manda Islands, 140 miles North-East of Mombasa. The town of Lamu, the most important Coast town North of Mombasa, is situated on Lamu Island. There is a good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, but the bar carries only 15 feet at low water. The exports are cocoa-nuts, copra, rope, mat bags, and some cattle.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Lamu.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The Post Office of the Colony (exclusive of Uganda, which is worked by the Kenya Post Office) received and despatched during 1932, 13,881,200 letters, packets, etc., and 388,643 telegrams.
