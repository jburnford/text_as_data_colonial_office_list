MALTA.

Situation and Area.

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 94,870 square miles; that of Gozo, 25,899 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filfa and Cominotto are mere islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

History.

The Maltese Islands were inhabited as early as the beginning of the Mousterian cultural period, about 40,000 B.C., by Neanderthal man, of whom remains were discovered in a cave to the southeast of Malta. Traces of paleolithic civilization are not wanting in the islands, and evidence of a neolithic civilization, in the shape of cave dwellings, stone circles, menhirs and dolmens, is found all over the islands. The Phoenicians probably
took possession of Malta as soon as they made themselves masters of the Mediterranean Sea. Phoenician remains are few, but there are numerous rock-cut graves of Phoenician type.

At the beginning of the Punic wars the islands were held by Carthage. In the course of the first Punic war they changed hands more than once, but at its conclusion they were still in the possession of the Carthaginians. In 218 B.C., they passed finally to Rome. Under the Romans Malta appears to have enjoyed great prosperity. Diodorus Siculus speaks of the excellence of its harbours, the wealth of its inhabitants, and its many skilful artificers, and refers to its fertility, and Cicero, in the Verrine orations, speaks of it as abounding in riches and famous for its textile manufactures. Inscriptions show that it enjoyed municipal rights in the time of Hadrian, and an interesting fact in its recorded history is that it was the scene of St. Paul's shipwreck (Acts xxviii.). On the final division of the Empire in 395 A.D., Malta fell to the share of the Byzantine Emperor, and for the next four centuries its history is almost a blank. In the 9th century it was three times invaded by the Arabs, who finally conquered it in 870, the Byzantine garrison being massacred in an insurrection of the inhabitants.

In 1090, Count Roger the Norman, with a handful of men, subjected the islands to Sicily. The Sicilian domination lasted for four hundred years, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and Castilian ruling in turn. During this time, Malta had Sicilian governors and laws, but there is no record of any extensive Sicilian immigration, and the persistence of the old Semitic names in the parish registers, instituted at this period, stands as further evidence that no great ethnographic changes occurred.

The connexion with Sicily was broken in 1530, when the Emperor Charles V gave Malta to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who had been driven from Rhodes by the Turks, and who held Malta until 1798. The loyalty of the Maltese to their new sovereigns, who for the first time were resident in the island, was put to a severe test on several occasions, the most notable being the great siege of 1565, when the Order of St. John, under Grand Master Jean de la Valette, resisted the attacks of the land and sea forces of Solyman the Magnificent. It was after this great feat of arms that the city of Valletta was built, strong enough to defy the Turkish attacks threatened yearly by the Sultan.

Napoleon Bonaparte invested the island on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda, and, on the 12th July, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed.

The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the re-commencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Climate.

The climate of Malta is equable and very healthy in winter. In July the heat at the sea level approaches that experienced in sub-tropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the scirocco wind. The mean maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 65° 5° Fahr., and the mean minimum 44° 6°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the mean maximum is 89° 6° Fahr., and the mean minimum 65° 5°. The mean temperature is 64° 5°, and the mean annual rainfall is 21 6 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous sandstone beds and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

Industry.

The island is highly cultivated. Besides products for home consumption, early potatoes, onions, cumin seed and oranges are exported. A large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepot and port of call. It is a port of registry, having, on 1st April, 1932, 34 vessels, 4,746 gross tonnage.

Chief Towns.

The chief town and capital is Valletta, having, with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's, a population which, in April, 1931, when a census was last taken, was 51,898. The "Three Cities" (Senglea, Cospicua, and Vittoriosa) have a population of 27,149. Citta Vecchia, the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, had a population of 10,632. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), with a population of about 5,361.

Inhabitants and Language.

The Maltese language, which is universally spoken, is of Semitic origin, and is akin to Arabic. The educated and commercial classes also speak English, and some Italian. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found in Algeria, Gibraltar, the Regency of Tunis, Egypt, Canada, Australia, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is, under Order in Council of September 24th, 1886, and Ordinance I of 1929, exclusively British. There are two local banks (Banco di Malta and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and branches of Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), the Banco di Roma, and the Crédit Foncier d'Algérie et de Tunisie. There is also Scicluna's Bank which is a private bank. The amount of British Treasury currency notes and Bank of England notes in circulation on 31st March, 1933, was roughly estimated at £50,000. The Government savings bank was established in 1833. On 31st March, 1933, the deposits amounted to £1,189,312. with 12,135 depositors.

Means of Communication.

Motor char-a-banc services run between all the towns and villages. The telephone service is now under Government control with an exchange at No. 3 Strada Fornie, Valletta, and with 896 miles of wires. Malta is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables

to Alexandria (3), Gibraltar (3), Bone (2), Messina
(1), Tripoli (1), Sicily (1), and Zante (1).

Malta is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is an important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling at any hour, day and night. There is direct mail communication with several Mediterranean ports and with England. The rates of postage are as follows:

Public Works.
The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and greatly improved their sanitary condition. New drainage works were commenced in 1899, and Cottmona, Sliema, St. Julian's, Misida, Pieta, Calcaria, Zabbar, Hamrun, Curmi, Rabat, Tarxien, Zalva, Luqa, Zeitun, Gharibgana, Balzan and Attard, part of Casa Lja and other places have been drained. The intercepting sewers to C. Axiak, Musta and Zebbug have also been started. The drainage of Gozo has also been commenced and Victoria, Sda Fontana and Ghaisnielem have been drained. Considerable progress has been made in improving the roads and streets in accordance with the exigencies of modern traffic. The main roads are being asphalted. So far 4·7 miles have been surfaced with sheet asphalt and 44·71 miles with full grouting, semi-grouting and surface asphalt dressing.

The water supply has now been extended to all the villages in Malta and Gozo, and works of considerable importance have been carried out to augment and improve it.

Electric current for lighting and power has been extended to all the towns in Malta, and to all the villages, with the exception of a few of the smaller ones situated at a distance from the supply area. This year extensions are being laid to the villages of St. Paul’s Bay, Zurrieq, Krendi, Mkabba and Dingli. In Gozo current is available only in the chief town, Victoria, which has its own generating station.

Constitution.
A Council of Government, partly elected, was constituted by Letters Patent in 1849, and reconstituted in 1887, the Letters Patent being amended in 1898 and again in 1903.

By Letters Patent dated April 14th, 1921, responsible government was established in Malta. The Letters Patent were proclaimed by the Governor at Valletta on 30th April, 1921, and became effective when elections for the Senate and Legislative Assembly having been held, the newly constituted Legislature was formally, on 1st November, 1921, declared open in His Majesty’s name by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales.

The previously existing Council of Government gave place to a Legislature composed of two Houses—the Senate and Legislative Assembly.

The Legislature.—The Senate is to consist of seventeen members, eight of whom form a quorum: ten of the seventeen to be called “Special Members,” and represent the Clergy, Nobility, the Graduates, the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union Council. The two members of the Clergy to be nominated by the Archbishop of Malta, and the other eight to be elected, in pairs, by the four special classes of electors whom they represent. The remaining seven Senators to be called “General Members,” and for their election Malta and Gozo to be divided into two constituencies, one of which (Valletta and its environs) is to return four senators, and the other (the remoter portions of Malta and Gozo), three. The voters for the special classes must be male British subjects over 21 years of age, and must have special qualifications, which are laid down in the Constitution Letters Patent. The voters for the General Members must be male British subjects over 21, able to read and write, and either paying £20 a year in rent or in possession of £20 a year from real property in Malta or other capital. Any person entitled to vote as a special elector may stand for election by his special class. A person qualified to vote for the general senators may be elected to the Senate upon fulfilling certain conditions, of which the most important are that he be an ecclesiastic of the higher orders, or hold a degree of the University, or be worth £100 a year, or pay rent to that amount.

It is provided that the Senate should continue in being for six years after election, unless sooner dissolved by the Governor.

The Legislative Assembly is to consist of 32 members, returned in groups of four by each of the eight electoral districts constituted by the Letters Patent (now repealed) of 3rd June, 1903; Malta being divided into seven districts, whilst Gozo forms one. Any male British subject who is over 21 years of age, and who either can read or write, or is worth £5 a year, or pays £5 a year in rent may vote in a constituency, and any person entitled to vote may be elected for any division. No person on full pay in the Navy, Army, or Air Force maintained by Imperial funds may, unless he has a legal domicile in Malta, be registered or vote.

For both Houses elections are to be held upon the principle of proportional representation.

It is provided that the Legislative Assembly should continue in being for three years after election unless sooner dissolved by the Governor.

A person cannot be a member of both Houses, and a person elected to both Houses must elect in which he will sit.

The Maltese Legislature may not pass laws touching the public safety and defence of the Empire, or the general interest of British subjects outside Malta. In addition to this general reservation certain subjects are, by specific provision, withheld from its legislative competence. The principal subjects so reserved are matters dealing with the defence of the island, and naval, military or aerial matters generally, external trade, immigration, aliens, and coinage. Measures passed affecting a local Government matter (highways, buildings, territorial waters, etc.) which apply to Imperial property must be reserved by the Governor for the Royal Assent, and do not become operative unless that Assent is given within a year.

The Legislature (provided that two-thirds of each House are in favour) may pass a law to repeal any of the provisions of the Constitution, except those relating to reserved matters or relating to Religious Toleration, Language, or the Reserved Civil List.

Elaborate provisions are made for the contingency of a difference of opinion between the two Houses as to a legislative measure. These provide for joint sittings, a dissolution and other arrangements intended to give time for reflection and compromise.
and, ultimately to give effect to the considered opinion of a two-third's majority of the two Houses sitting together.

Power is reserved to His Majesty to disallow any law passed by the Legislature and assented to by the Governor within one year of the giving of that assent, and the Governor may reserve any Bill for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure thereon.

H.M. in Council or the Governor, subject to H.M.'s approval, may make laws dealing with the "reserved matters" described in the Constitution Letters Patent.

The Ministry.—There is provision for seven Ministries in the Government, to which Ministers may be appointed by the Governor in His Majesty's name, and these include the headships of twelve departments—Justice, Treasury, Public Instruction, Public Health, etc. Ministers must sit in one House, and do not vacate their seats on appointment. They may sit and speak, but not vote, in either House.

Responsible government was temporarily suspended in 1930, but, following the report of the Malta Royal Commission 1931 (Cmd. 3093), it was decided to restore it, and a General Election took place in 1932. Responsible government was again suspended on the 2nd November, 1933*, and the Senate and Legislative Assembly were dissolved from the same date.

There is a Chief Justice and five judges, whose salaries and tenure are secured by amendments inserted in the Constitution since its publication.

The Roman Catholic religion is by law the religion of the country; but full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship are guaranteed, and persons of any faith may hold any office.

Language.—English, and Italian as the language of the Maltese Courts, are the official languages of Malta. All administration is carried on in English, but in notices and documents an Italian translation may accompany the English text so far as desirable and convenient. No legislative or administrative act may be done which will diminish or detract from the position of the English language, or tend to restrict its use in education or the public service. The English and Italian languages are recognised as equal languages of culture in Malta at the University and the Secondary Schools as subjects of study.

Italian remains the official language of the Courts, but English-speaking persons and Maltese-speaking persons charged with a criminal offence have the right to apply for the proceedings to be held in English or Maltese.

English and the Maltese language, which is the language of general intercourse among all classes in the Islands, are the languages of instruction and study in the Elementary Schools. Maltese is one of the languages recognised in the Courts.

Finance.—The revenue from all sources is paid into a Consolidated Fund, out of which the Public Service is supplied. Under responsible government the Legislature provides for audit and (subject to an obligation to pay the Reserved Civil List) controls expenditure. Money bills must originate in the Lower House and may not be altered by the Senate, but the Senate may return a money bill with their suggestions, which the Lower House must consider. The Senate may, finally, reject a money bill, but may not alter it. The Legislature can only appropriate money out of the Consolidated Fund or alter or impose taxation upon a recommendation of the Governor (advised by his Ministers), and money may only be paid out of the Treasury upon a Governor's Warrant to the Treasurer. The Consolidated Fund has to defray the expenses of the Maltese Imperial Government, and to pay any other sum which the Governor declares to the Lower House to be necessary either to pay the expenses of the Nominated Council, the Privy Council (see infra) or the Joint Committee of the Privy Council, or to meet other expenses entailed in dealing with questions as to reserved matters.

Appointments to Public Offices in Malta (except those of Ministers) are made by the Governor in Council. The Crown reserves power at any time to revoke or amend all or any of the provisions relating to reserved matters, language in debates, religious toleration, language generally, and the Reserved Civil List.

The Reserved Civil List covers the charges for the Maltese Imperial Government (that is for the Governor's salary and establishment, and the salaries and establishments of the Lieutenant-Governor and Legal Adviser), and also the Judges' salaries.

Education and Religion.

Elementary education is carried on principally in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are two secondary schools with 240 scholars, 4 central schools and 90 elementary schools and 62 night schools with an average enrolment of 29,799 pupils, and an average attendance of 25,500. There is a public Lyceum with 673 day scholars, and 280 who attend evening classes, and a university (founded in 1769) with an average attendance of about 120 students. At these two latter institutions the fees are comparatively low, ranging from 80s. to 120s. per annum in the Lyceum and not exceeding 6l., exclusive of laboratory and other fees, per annum for all lectures in the University. There are numerous private, elementary and secondary schools. The total number of these schools is about 43, with an approximate attendance of 3,624 pupils. Education is not compulsory, but attendance is obligatory for all pupils on the registers of a Government Elementary School.

The Roman Catholic Religion is by law the religion of the country, but full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship are guaranteed, and persons of any faith may hold any office.

Customs Tariff.

Up to January, 1917, only specific duties were levied, the main headings being Grain, Wine, Beer, Spirits, Cattle, Petroleum, Sugar and Tobacco.

In January, 1917, ad valorem duties, varying from 5 per cent. to 20 per cent. were introduced, embracing all commodities not already affected by specific duties, and not included in a list of exempted articles which:

(a) Under Food and Drink shows Butter, Cheese, Coffee, Milk (fresh or preserved), Eggs in the shell, Tea and Cocoa, and certain other articles;
(b) under Raw Materials and Articles mainly unmanufactured shows Coal, Coke, Patent Fuel and Fuel Oil, Sponges, Vegetables and Flower Seeds and certain other articles;
(c) under Manufactured Articles, includes Agricultural Machines, Books, Cinema Films, Scientific and Surgical Instruments, Machinery and Plant operated by mechanic power imported for industrial purposes, wrapping and printing paper, Laundry Soap, Yarns for lace-making and weaving, Twines for industrial purposes, certain materials used for cap-making, shoemaking, and bag-making, and certain articles used for divine worship;
(d) under Miscellaneous and Unclassified Articles—includes articles imported by Government Departments—Bran not containing more than 5 per cent. Flour—Bullion and Specie, and Engravings, Drawings and Paintings representing Maltese views and subjects of local interest.

* See Proclamations of the 2nd Nov., 1933.
The amount of duty collected in 1932-33 from specific duties was £76,584, and from ad valorem duties was £17,988.

With a few exceptions, 10 per cent. ad valorem is at present the rate of ad valorem duty.

The Customs Tariff does not include provisions for Empire Preference.

The value of imports in 1932 from the United Kingdom was £94,564, from other parts of the British Empire £23,441, and from foreign countries £2,122,707; the respective percentages of imports being:—United Kingdom 28-6 per cent., other parts of the British Empire 6-9 per cent., and Foreign Countries 64-6 per cent.

The value of domestic exports in 1932 to the United Kingdom was £20,489, to other parts of the British Empire £9,662, to Foreign Countries £14,207, and as Ships' Stores £7,892. The respective percentages were United Kingdom 11-2 per cent., to other parts of the British Empire 5-3 per cent., to Foreign Countries 7-9 per cent., Ships' Stores 4-3 per cent.

The value of re-exports in 1932 to the United Kingdom was £9,979, to other parts of the British Empire £309, to Foreign Countries £6,079, as Ships' Stores £30,006, and as Bunkers £7,672.

The respective percentages for re-exports were: United Kingdom 5-7 per cent., other parts of the British Empire 0-2 per cent., Foreign Countries 36-2 per cent., Ships' Stores 16-4 per cent. and as Bunkers 41-5 per cent.

All the foregoing figures are exclusive of Bullion and Specie.

The total percentages of trade compared with the whole import and export trade of the Island (Imports, Domestic Exports and Re-exports), for the respective destinations are as follows:

| Destination                  | Percentage |
|------------------------------|------------|
| United Kingdom               | 26-7%      |
| Other parts of the British Empire | 6-5%       |
| Foreign Countries             | 63-9%      |
| Ships' Stores                | 1-0%       |
| Bunker Coaling               | 1-9%       |

Revenue.

The most important sources of revenue are the Customs duties, licences, stamp duties, succession and donation duties, fees of office and reimbursements, post office, water and electricity receipts, land revenue, interest, and Public Lotto profit.

Public Debt.

There is, strictly speaking, no public debt in Malta, but interest at 2¼% is paid by the Government on £79,081 outstanding balance on 31st March, 1933, of the debt known as "Massa Frumentaria," incurred by the Municipality of Valletta under the Government of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, in connection with the monopoly of the trade of wheat. The funds of the "Massa Frumentaria" were, in 1798, appropriated by the French Government, then in occupation of the Island.
