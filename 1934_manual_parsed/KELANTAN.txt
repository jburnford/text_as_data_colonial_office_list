KELANTAN.

His Highness the Sultan Ismail ibni Almarhum Sultan Mohamed IV, K.C.M.G.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 4° 36' and 6° 15' North, and between longitudes 101° 22' and 102° 37' East. It is bounded on the North by the China Sea; on the East by Trengganu and the China Sea; on the South by Pahang; and on the West by Perak and Siamese Territory. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,720 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the State according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the South. Gunong Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and the Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Tabel, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1931 census was 362,517, including 330,774 Malays, 17,612 Chinese, 6,752 Indians, 124 Europeans, 32 Eurasians, and 7,223 others.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 14,843 people. It is a clean, well-laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has 65 schools attended by some 4,235 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Pahang has been completed. Kota Bharu is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Puteh, Kuala Krai, Pasir Mas, Bachok and Pleklang. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 3,431), Bachok (population 776), on the coast, Pasir Puteh (population 1,308), and Kuala Krai, the headquarters of the southern district of the State. The trunk road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai is open for traffic.

Pasir Puteh is connected with Kota Bharu by a road which is practicable in all weathers. The East Coast Railway, connecting Kelantan with Singapore, has been completed. There is also a daily train service between Tumpat and Penang via the Royal Siamese Railway.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the last harvest of which amounted to 73,948 tons. Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown in the coastal plain. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, Para rubber has been largely planted in recent years; in addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. The area under rubber is about 92,889 acres, of which rather more than one half comprises Asiatic holdings. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, though it is necessary periodically to restrict the export in order to maintain sufficient cattle for agricultural purposes. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Some 3,068 acres are held on mining titles. Though both tin and gold are found in Kelantan, yet very little mining is being done for either metal. Much prospecting for gold is being done in the Ulu Kelantan district, but is not yet sufficiently advanced to enable any forecast to be made as to its ultimate results. No tin-ore was exported in 1932.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, rubber, cattle, betelnuts, fish and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are rice, tobacco, cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, sugar, timber, salt, and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plain the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90°F., or goes below 69°F., except in January and February, when 64°F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoons keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 121-71 inches a year.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.

Regular steamship communication is maintained between Singapore and Kelantan.

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the North-east monsoon from November to February. The annual average is about 100 inches. The temperature ranges between 76° and 96° F., the greatest range recorded in 24 hours being 25°. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee, and pepper. During part of the N.E. monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable.

British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909. The suzerainty of Siam, transferred on that date to Great Britain, was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the bunga mas (golden leaves and flowers) to Bangkok. An agreement between His Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainul'abidin was made on 22nd April, 1910, and a further Agreement was made on 24th May, 1919. Under these Agreements His Majesty's Government guarantees protection of the State from foreign aggression, and the Trengganu Government accepts a British Adviser whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues; the cost of this Adviser and his establishment to be determined by the High Commissioner and to be charged on the revenues of the State.

The ruling of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainul'abidin through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

The Public debt at the end of 1932 amounted to $3,986,495. It consists of loans by the Government of the Straits Settlements for the purpose of resumption of Ruling House Land Concessions, Surveys, road construction and other development works.
