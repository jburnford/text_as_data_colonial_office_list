PERLIS.

His Highness, Syed Alwi, C.M.G., C.B.E., Raja.
Perlis is a small State on the West coast of the Malay Peninsula, North of Kedah. Its area is 310 square miles.
Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.
The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano.
The Federated Malay States Railway runs through the State and connects with the Siamese railway system at Padang Besar. H.H. the Raja resides at Arun which is on the railway. The main Government Offices are at Kangar, about six miles from Arun. There is a Post and Telegraph Office at Kangar and a telephone system exists between the police stations in the State. There are 36½ miles of metalled roads and 20½ miles of gravelled roads and paths kept up by Government.
The population is 48,970 (mid. 1932), of whom 40,128 are Malays. Public revenue and expenditure:—

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1350 (A.D. 1932) | $407,145 | $421,764 |

The State, by loans made in 1906 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. Repayment of these loans was completed in 1929, and the State is now free from debt. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.
The relations between Perlis and Great Britain are defined in a Treaty signed at Arun on 28th April, 1930.
The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are four other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

Members of the State Council.
President, His Highness The Raja, Syed Alwi, C.M.G C.B.E.
Vice-President, Syed Hamzah.
