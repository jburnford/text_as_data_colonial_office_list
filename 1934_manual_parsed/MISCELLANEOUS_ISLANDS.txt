MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS.

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants, but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection, or for coconut planting. The rents are paid into the Exchequer.

Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island and Cate Island (in the Norfolk Island Group), Baine Island, and Bell Cay (near British New Guinea), Caroline Island, Flint Island and Vostoc Island, (Pacific Ocean, 9° 56' S. lat., 150° 6' W. long., and 11° 26' S. lat., and 151° 48' W. long.), Malden Island (4° 1' S. lat., 155° 57' W. long.), leased to Messrs. Grice, Sumner, and Co., and Starback Island; also Gough, Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands (in the S. Atlantic), and there are many others.

The Kuria-Muria Islands, five in number, off the south-east coast of Arabia, were ceded by the Imam of Muskat for the purpose of landing the Red Sea telegraph cable.
