CAYMAN ISLANDS.

Description.
The Cayman Islands, which form a dependency of Jamaica, consist of three islands—Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac—lying between 79° 83' and 81° 30' W. longitude and 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. latitude, and having a total area of about 104 square miles. They were discovered by Columbus on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession soon after the conquest of Jamaica in the middle of the seventeenth century and the islands were mainly colonised from Jamaica, though many English and Scottish mariners, shipwrecked on the coast of Cuba, settled on the islands.
The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is considerably larger than in other parts of the West Indies.

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, with a varying breadth from 4 to 7 miles, and has an area of 85 square miles. The total population of the islands is about 6,200, of which some 4,600 live in Grand Cayman, where Georgetown, the capital town, with a population of 1,800, is situated.

The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized deep-water harbours.

**Industries, Trade and Customs.**

The chief industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle—or "turtling," as it is called. These turtles are brought to the island and placed in "crawls" to recover and fatten before export. The demand for turtle has, however, declined and at present attention is being given more to "sharking," as there is a ready market for sharkskins in America.

The people are first-class shipbuilders and many fine schooners are built in these islands for local use and sale abroad.

Georgetown is a Port of Registry and 53 sailing vessels and 11 motor vessels, with an aggregate net tonnage of 4,556, are on the registry of shipping there.

The islands are in some parts fruitful and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable acreage is traversed by honeycombed limestone and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found. Agricultural pursuits are fostered and encouraged by an Agricultural Society.

Many of the islanders find employment on the mainland of America and in foreign vessels, supporting their families in Cayman by remittances from abroad.

An ad valorem customs duty of 12½% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. The revenue derived from these duties amounted to 3,704l. in 1932.

**Climate.**

The climate from November to March is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, but during the summer months, it is hot, with southerly winds. Mosquitoes abound in the summer. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1931 was 102 inches which was abnormally high, the average annual rainfall being about 55 inches.

The more recent hurricane at the islands occurred in September, 1917, August, 1909, and August, 1903—previous to this there was a severe hurricane in October, 1876.

**Communications.**

Two regular motor-schooner services are maintained from Georgetown—one with Kingston, Jamaica, and the other with Isle of Pines, Cuba, and Tampa, Florida. There is also communication by sailing vessels with the ports of Central America.

**Education.**

Education is in charge of a Board of Education which receives an annual grant of 1,425l. from the public revenue. Twelve public elementary schools are maintained, with a roll of 916 pupils and an average attendance of 736.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 26) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica and these, with 27 elected members, known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly under the presidency of the Commissioner. Elections are held biennially.

The present constitution of this Assembly of Justices and Vestry is 100 years old and the centenary has recently been commemorated by a special issue of postage stamps.

There is no Public Debt.

**Civil Establishment.**

Commissioner and Judge, A. W. Cardinal, furnished house, 500l. to 600l. and fees.
