JOHORE.

His Highness Sir Ibrahim, G.C.M.G., K.B.E., etc., etc., Sultan and Sovereign Ruler of the State and Territories of Johore.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the North by Pahang, on the North-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the West by the Straits of Malacca, on the South by the Strait North of Singapore, and on the East by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,320 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the North-west running through the district on the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the North, which, during part of its course forms the boundary with Pahang and Johore; and the Johore river which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bahru, the capital, situated on the Straits, opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Penggaram in Batu Pahat.

The climate approximates to that of Singapore and the Federated Malay States, the highest maximum and the lowest minimum temperature in 1932 being 98°c and 63° respectively.

The population estimated at mid 1932 was 489,749, of whom the malay inhabitants comprised 338,961 or 49 per cent. The population of Johore Bahru town was estimated as 20,636.

In area, Johore approximates to Wales; in population to Cyprus.

History.

Of Johore history little is known prior to the advent of the Portuguese. A number of semi-wild "proto-Malay" tribes exist chiefly along the coasts; while the civilised occupants of the country are the descendants of the Malays who brought their civilisation from Palembang in Sumatra.

As the Buddhist State of Palembang grew in power, colonies of Malays commenced to settle on the Peninsula. Singapore, founded under the name of Tamasek about this time, was ruled by its own kings. A Siamese law of 1390 includes Ujong Tanah (or Johore), Malaka, and Malayu among tributary states.

About 1365 A.D. Javanese from Majapahit conquered the country and destroyed Singapore. Malacca then grew to be the first trading centre of the East, and after its conquest by the Portuguese in 1511, a son of the conquered King settled at Johore Lama and founded the historic Sultanate of Johore.

The history of the next 300 years, however, is an almost uninterrupted record of wars. Persistent hostilities with the Portuguese continued nearly
until the arrival of the Dutch in 1602. The State bears no small part in Dutch Colonial history; relations were friendly, despite a diplomatic struggle for commercial privileges. But, after violent attacks by the Achinese, Johore had become by 1637 practically an appanage of the Achinese Kingdom. In return for assistance rendered at the successful attack on Malacca in 1641, the Dutch tried to restore Johore to its former position as the premier Malay State. A port with a customs officer existed at Singapore. But the capital was plundered and burnt by Jambi in 1673, in 1699 the Sultan was assassinated, and in 1717 the throne was seized by a Sumatran adventurer, Raja Kechil. Then the Bugis ships appeared. The subsequent process, partly conquest, partly assimilation, while disturbing to Johore, resulted in a wide extension of its sovereignty, which now spread to Pahang, Siak, Riau, Linggi and part of Selangor.

After 60 years of continuous intrigues between the Malay and Bugis chiefs the Dutch in 1784 recognised the Malay Sultan as ruler of Johore, drove the Bugis from Riau and stationed there a Resident with a garrison; after some further fighting the Malay Sultan and the Bugis viceroy accepted the position of dependent princes, but the old empire of Johore (Linggi and Klang had been ceded to the Dutch in 1757) was in a state of dissolution, the Bendahara and Temenggong being virtually territorial chiefs in Pahang and Johore respectively. This was the position when the English, by virtue of treaties made in 1819 and 1824, obtained a complete cession of the island of Singapore.

Contemporary visitors emphasize the deserted character of the country; in 1847 the capital consisted merely of 26 huts. (In 1855 the capital was moved to its present situation at Johore Bahru.) But the extension of the Pax Britannica and the assistance rendered by the Governor of the Straits Settlements "helped Johore to grow populous again," moreover, the country has been governed since 1862 by two enlightened and progressive rulers, Sultan Abubakar, who died in 1895, and Sultan Ibrahim the present ruler.

In 1895 the Sultan undertook to receive a British Agent having the functions of a Consular Officer; in 1910, the Sultan having had an unofficial adviser for some years, reorganised his Government with the assistance of the Governor of the Straits Settlements; in 1914 a General Adviser with enlarged powers was appointed. The recent history of the State has been a record of continued prosperity. Telephonic communication was established between Johore and Singapore in 1883; a postal service was inaugurated in 1884, letters being transported by coach till the opening of the railway across Singapore Island in 1903; in 1909 the Johore State railway, linking up with the Federated Malay States Railway system, was completed; finally, in 1924, the completion of the causeway across the Straits permits uninterrupted railway connection between Singapore and Bangkok.

**Constitution.**

In 1895 the Sultan promulgated a written constitution, to which supplements have been added. His Highness has a Council of Ministers, consisting entirely of high Malay Officers of State, together with an Executive Council consisting of certain Malay and British officers.

The Legislature consists of a Council of State, to which Asiatic and European official and unofficial members are appointed.

The Judicial system resembles that of the Federated Malay States, minor cases being decided by Magistrates with appeal to the Supreme Court, and major cases by the Supreme Court, with appeal to the Court of Appeal, and thence in special cases to the Privy Council.

Cases involving matters regulated by Muhamadan law are decided in the Court of Kathi, with appeal to the Sultan in Executive Council.

Judges of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements and of the Federated Malay States are ex-officio Judges of the State of Johore, and vice versa.

There is no Public Debt.

A branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is established at Johore Bahru and at Muar, and a Chinese bank at Batu Pahat.

Manufacturing industries are in their infancy, being confined to 7 pineapple factories, 17 tapioca factories, and a few saw-mills, brickworks, and similar undertakings.

Electric power stations have been erected at Johore Bahru, Muar, and Segamat.

**Communications.**

About 1,200 motor vehicles a day cross the causeway connecting the main land with Singapore Island.

Posts, Telegraphs, Telephones.—In addition to the General Post Office at Johore Bahru, 26 branch offices are established.

41 telephone exchanges are in operation, and the number will be increased. Communication is established between Johore Bahru and Singapore, and between Muar and the Malacca and Federated Malay States systems.

Accommodation.—The Johore Station Hotel at Johore Bahru provides the usual accommodation for travellers. The Government also maintains Rest Houses at Muar, Batu Pahat, Kota Tinggi, Segamat, Batu Anam, Mersing, and Kluang.

General.

Education.—The Government has established six English Schools and 115 Vernacular Schools. Grants-in-aid are made to estate Tamil Schools.

Military Forces.—The total strength of the Johore Military Forces in 1932 amounted to 646. There are English and Malay Volunteer contingents.
