Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 91 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of near 2,600 feet above the sea level. Its length about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area about 32 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Lyeeun Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (2½ square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1860 with the Government of China, and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutters Green, Aplichau, Middle, Round, and other islets.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with the Chinese Government for the extension of Hong Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwang-tung, including Mira Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be let for 99 years; a stipulation was included within the walled city of Kowloon (which outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defense of Hong Kong, but that within the remainder of newly-leased territory Great Britain should have sole jurisdiction. In 1899 the Chinese officials ceased to exercise jurisdiction within Kowloon, which thereafter, by Her late Majesty's Order-in-Council, was incorporated in the leased territory and became subject to British rule. The area of the mainland and islands leased is about 10 square miles. A careful survey of the territory was completed in 1904. This New Territory divided into two main districts—the Northern and the Southern—and is in charge of District Officers, who perform the duties of local officers and magistrates, and are authorised to hold small debts courts. The District Officer of the Northern district has his headquarters at Tai Po on an arm of Mira Bay; the headquarters of the Southern district are in Victoria.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'oeil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with classic beauty of Italy. The city of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the world, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well grown and handsome trees. Some large and handsome buildings stand on the Praya Reclamation, which was completed in 1903.

Other important reclamation schemes completed in recent years are the Praya East (2,249,000 sq. ft.), Tai Kok Tsui (1,868,500 sq. ft.),
Shamshuipo (2,842,000 sq. ft.), and Kowloon Bay (9,589,000 sq. ft.). On the reclaimed area at the northern end of Kowloon Bay an aerodrome has been constructed at Kaitak.

Climate.

Though situated within the tropics Hong Kong enjoys a cool winter, the mean temperature falling from 32° in August to 59° in February. Temperatures of less than 40° and of greater than 90° occur occasionally.

The mean annual rainfall is 85 inches, of which 67 inches occurs from May to September.

The relative humidity is very high in the spring, frequently reaching 98%. In the winter it occasionally falls as low as 20%.

The prevalent wind is from E.N.E. in the winter with a mean velocity of 15 m.p.h. in March, when the north-east monsoon is at its height. During the summer months the wind is very variable, both in direction and velocity. In some years a south-west monsoon is fairly persistent, in others intermittent and short-lived.

Typhoons occur occasionally from June to October. Very occasionally they occur before or after this period.

The climate of Victoria is similar in its broad features to that of Kowloon and the New Territories, but at the higher levels, from 1,400 to 1,800 feet above sea level, the temperature is on the average about 3° lower than at the Observatory, Kowloon, in the winter, and 8° lower in the summer. The humidity is usually greater than in Kowloon and approaches saturation for several days at a time during March and April when mist is very prevalent. In summer the city of Victoria, and the rising terraces behind it, derive little or no benefit from the south-west monsoon, being sheltered by steep hills from south-east to south-west. In winter it is exposed to the north-east monsoon, which occasionally blows along the harbour through Lyuemun Pass with considerable violence. On the other hand the south-west side of the Island is protected from the north-east monsoon in winter and enjoys the benefit of the south-west monsoon in summer.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843. The additions subsequently obtained on the mainland have been noted above.

Hong Kong did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851 and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1932 being: emigrants, 55,639; immigrants, 232,396, excluding to and from China ports.

Population.

| Year | Non-Chinese | Chinese | Total (Civil) |

Industry, Trade, and Customs.

Hong Kong is a free port except for an Import Tariff on all intoxicating liquors, on spirituous liquors containing more than two per cent. of pure alcohol by weight, on tobacco, and on light oils (including motor spirit) and on motor vehicles. There is no Export Tariff.

The position of the island has made it a distributing centre for trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal commodities handled are coal, cotton, and cotton goods, hides, iron and steel, matches, nuts, oils, rice, sugar, silk, sandalwood, tea, tin, wolframite, etc.

Ship-building is a large and growing industry, and there are also factories of very considerable importance engaged in the manufacture of cigars and cigarettes, rope, cement, rubber shoes, and the refining of sugar.

Native industries such as the manufacture of vermilion, sauces, bamboo-ware, building of native craft, etc., are of large and increasing dimensions.

The natural products of Hong Kong are few and unimportant. There is little land suitable for tillage, and nothing is grown but a little rice and some vegetables near the outlying villages. There are large granite quarries both on the island and in Kowloon. A dairy farm supplies fresh meat, poultry, eggs, and milk. The fishing in the waters of the Colony is good and is a source of livelihood to a vast number of Chinese.

The New Territories have extensive cultivable land, on which are grown sugar, rice, vegetables, lychees, pineapples, etc. The cultivation is entirely in the hands of the Chinese villagers and it is doubtful whether European enterprise would be successful.

Shipping.

The total tonnage entering and clearing during the year 1932 amounted to 43,824,906 tons, a decrease of 325,115 tons compared with 1931. There were 26,019 arrivals of 20,899,459 tons and 26,340 departures of 20,894,546 tons.

Of British ocean-going tonnage 6,109,649 tons entered, and 6,092,041 tons cleared.

Of British river steamers 4,105,025 tons entered, and 4,111,503 tons cleared.

Of foreign ocean-going tonnage 8,544,831 tons entered, and 8,522,552 tons cleared.

Of foreign river steamers 548,273 tons entered, and 548,014 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons trading to ports outside the Colony, 98,620 tons entered, and 99,137 tons cleared.

Of junks in foreign trade 1,493,061 tons entered, and 1,521,299 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons plying within the waters of the Colony 382,976 tons entered, and 383,204 tons cleared.

Of junks in local trade 629,154 tons entered, and 635,567 tons cleared.

Docks.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company has three dry docks, the larger one being re-constructed, and two slips at their Kowloon establishment, one dry dock at Mong Kok Tsui on the western side of the Kowloon Peninsula, and two at Aberdeen on the south side of the island. The Tai Kok Dockyard and Engineering Company has one large dock and three slipways situated at Quarry Bay, just inside the Lyuemun Pass.
The Admiralty has built a large dock in the Naval Dockyard in the middle of the City of Victoria. Besides these, there are several building slips and repairing shops owned by Europeans and Chinese in various parts of the Colony.

**Wharves.**

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf & Godown Co., situated on the mainland, has five wharves and can accommodate vessels of 550 ft. in length. No. 1 and No. 5 Wharves are capable of accommodating vessels up to 660 feet.

Alf. Holt & Co. have two wharves at the East Point of the Kowloon Peninsula and have accommodation for large vessels.

At North Point on the Hong Kong side of the Harbour, the Ching Shong Land Investment Co. has built about 1,700 feet of quay walling providing a depth of 30 feet of water alongside at L.W.E.S.T.

In addition, there are many wharves privately owned by shipping firms, situated in the Central district.

**Government Harbour Moorings.**

There are at present laid down in the Harbour for the use of vessels frequenting the Port fifty-six (56) complete sets of Government Harbour Moorings, classed as follows:—

- **A Class.** Moorings for vessels of 450 feet to 600 feet in length O.A. ... 19
- **B Class.** Moorings for vessels of 300 feet to 450 feet in length O.A. ... 29
- **C Class.** Moorings for vessels of less than 300 feet in length O.A. ... 8

Total ... ... ... ... ... 56

**Currency and Banking.**

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 2nd Feb., 1896):—

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. British dollar.
3. The Hong Kong dollar, half-dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
4. Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
5. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint 2,108,054 dollars and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of $402,671. There were obtained from England, and there were in circulation on 31st Dec., 1932, subsidiary coins (which now include half dollars) to the nominal value of $18,054,370.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now.

The principal Banks are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd., the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Mercantile Bank of India, the P. & O. Banking Corporation, Ltd., the National City Bank of New York, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Netherlands-India Commercial Bank, the Netherlands Trading Society, the Banque de l'Indo-Chine, the Crédit-Foncier d'Extrême Orient. The first named bank conducts a Savings Bank. There are also a large number of Chinese banks.

The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Mercantile Bank of India are authorised to issue notes in the Colony, the total circulation amounting to $153,611,606 at the close of 1932.

Local weights and measures are the following:

- tsell = 1½ oz.; 1 picul = 133½ lbs. (avoirdupois);
- catties = 1 imperial gallon.

**Revenue.**

Revenue is derived from duties on intoxicating liquor, which in 1932 were expected to realize $1,900,000, tobacco $2,600,000 stamp revenue $2,136,000. A considerable sum is also derived from the Opium monopoly, municipal rates for police, lighting, water, etc. (the rates according to the districts varying from 15 to 17 per cent on the annual value of property), land revenue, stamp duties, and other fees. It was expected that land sales would realise $2,400,000.

The total revenue for 1933 is estimated at $33,027,000.

**Means of Communication.**

Hong Kong is extremely well situated as regards telegraphic communication in all directions with all parts of the world. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company (British) by means of three cables to Singapore, one direct and one each via Labuan and Cape St. James respectively, provide good connections with Europe via India, with Australasia, and with the other British Colonies and possessions. By their cable to Manila connection is made with the direct American cable, thence to San Francisco. Two cables to Shanghai, belonging respectively to the Eastern Extension and to the Great Northern (Danish) Companies, via Foochow and Amoy respectively, give a good connection with Shanghai, North China, Japan, and Russia; and the system of the Great Northern Telegraph Company gives a good service to Europe, via Asiatic Russia.

Commercial wireless telegraph services are maintained with ships at sea, Canton, Swatow, Shanghai, and North China via Shanghai, points in Kwangtung and Kwangsi Provinces, Yunnanfu, Macau, French Indo-China (direct to Saigon and Hanoi), Kwongchowau, North Borneo, Siam, Dutch East Indies, and via Dutch East Indies to Europe and American Continents, Manila to Europe and American Continents. All services are operated and controlled from the Government Radio Office situated in the central district of Victoria. The transmitters
are grouped at Cape D'Aguilar Station, position lat. 22° 12'38"61" N.; long. 114° 15'18"94" E.

Call signals:- V P S for ship services, Z B W for broadcasting, and the series Z O E to Z C K for commercial services. The main receiving station is situated at Victoria Peak, from which station received signals are passed by tone lines to the Radio Office.

In addition, meteorological and time signal services are carried on, the Police Department has its own communication system, and the Waglan and Gap Rock Lighthouses have installations for emergency communication.

A broadcasting service for the transmission of news items, speeches, music, etc., is maintained by a transmitter installed at Kowloon which is controlled from an up-to-date studio and control room situated on the second floor of the Gloucester Building. The broadcast wave length is 350 metres and the call signal Z B W.

Hong Kong possesses unrivalled steam communication. The P. & O. S. N. Co., M. M. Cie, Holt's Line, City Line, and N.Y.K. maintain a regular service with the United Kingdom and Europe. The Holt's line, O.S.K., N.Y.K., and Dollar Line maintain a regular service between Hong Kong and the United States of America. The Canadian Pacific S.S. Limited maintain a regular service with Vancouver, B.C.

The E. & A., Australian Oriental Line, and N.Y.K. and O.S.K. keep up a frequent service to Australian ports. In addition to these main lines of steamers, there are other lines which call at Hong Kong from various ports, such as the Shire, Glen, and Bank lines, and Lloyd Trestino.

Regular steam communication between Java and Hong Kong has been established by the Java-China-Japan Line. Between the ports on the east coast of China, Formosa, and Hong Kong the steamers of the Douglas S. S. Co. ply regularly twice a week, and those of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha weekly, and there is constant steam communication with Hoihow, Manila, Saigon, Haiphong, Tourane, Bangkok, Borneo, etc. With Shanghai, Tientsin, and the ports of Japan there is frequent communication by steamers of the Indo-China S. N. Co., China Navigation, and other lines, in addition to the English, French and American mail steamers. With Calcutta there are services by the Indo-China S. N. Co., O.S.K., N.Y.K., and the British India Line, about once a fortnight by each line. Between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton there is a daily steam service, and numerous steamers as far as Wuchow on the West River.

A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels. An electric tramway from Shaukiwan to Kennedy Town, along the whole extent of the city, was completed and opened in July, 1904. The island possesses roads available for vehicular traffic both in the town and outside from which unrivalled views can be obtained, especially from the wind-swept roads in the hill districts. There is also a fine motor road round the island.

There are excellent motor roads in Kowloon and the New Territory—the road to Fanling via Castle Peak and back via Tai po being a panorama of views over a route of several miles.

The usual means of transport is by motor, ricksha, chair, or boat. A railway was completed in 1910 from Kowloon to the Chinese frontier, where it joins the line from Canton. Telephonic communication is available to all parts of the Colony and to Canton.

Education.

Since 1913 the schools in the Colony, with few exceptions, have been placed by Ordinance under the supervision and control of the Education Department. The total number of pupils is about 71,200, of whom, roughly speaking, one-third are in schools in which English is the medium of instruction, and two-thirds are in Vernacular Schools. There are four schools exclusively for children of British parentage, with an average attendance of 429. Queen's and King's Colleges are the principal schools for Chinese, with an average attendance of 544 and 892 respectively. Including the above, the average attendance at Government schools is 4,119. Most of the non-Government English schools are assisted by grants, which amounted in 1932 to $183,935. Many of the vernacular schools are assisted by subsidies and grants, amounting in 1932 to $127,697.

A technical institute supplies instruction in commercial and technical subjects. The enrolment in 1932 was 632.

The University of Hong Kong, incorporated under the local University Ordinance, 1911, and opened in 1912, is a residential University, the object of which is declared by that Ordinance to be "the promotion of Arts, Science and Learning, the provision of higher education, the conferring of degrees, the development and formation of the character of students of all races, nationalities and creeds, and the maintenance of good understanding with the neighbouring country of China."

Instruction is provided in the three Faculties of Medicine, Engineering, and Arts and the following Degrees are awarded: Medicine, M.B.B.S., M.D., M.S.; Engineering, B.Sc. (Eng.), M.Sc. (Eng.); Arts: B.A., M.A. The standard aimed at is that of University degrees in Great Britain, and the Medical degrees of the University are recognized by the General Medical Council for registration in Great Britain.

The buildings, including class-rooms and residential accommodation for 400 students, together with playing fields occupy an area of about 36½ acres.

The endowment funds exceed $9,000,000, of which $750,000 represents a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation for the establishment of full-time chairs in Surgery, Medicine, and Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The Colonial
Government has contributed land to the approximate value of $175,000, together with capital sums amounting to $1,700,000, and provides an annual grant of $350,000.

The course is one of 4 years in Engineering and Arts, and of 6 years in Medicine. The annual entry is now about 60. Students are of all nationalities, but the great majority are Chinese drawn from all parts of China and the Far East.

The University is open to students of both sexes. There are at present 40 women students out of a total of 360 students on the rolls.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six official and three unofficial members, besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of nine official and six unofficial members, eight of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (three being Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils, appointed after receipt of the Additional Instructions passed under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet and dated 10th January, 1922, vacate their seats after five and four years respectively from date of appointment. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances, of which a revised edition to 1923 has been issued. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901.
