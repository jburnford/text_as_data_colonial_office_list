NORTHERN RHODESIA.

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the Territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyassaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 287,960 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine Provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Livingstone, situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls. Other important settlements are at Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Lusaka, Mazabuka, Ndola near which the copper mines of Bwana Mkuwa, Nchanga, Nkana, Roan Antelope, and Mufulingu are situated, Abencorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery, Kasempa, and Mongu-Lealui in Barotseland. A new Administrative Headquarters is in course of construction at Lusaka.

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer, with whose advent the authentic history of Northern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at the Zambesi near the place where the town bearing his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interceptioned on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa, and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey ordered a general advance into German East Africa of the troops under his command, and by July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy. Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbecke doubled southwards, and on the 1st November made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier station, Fife. From there they proceeded southwest to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies for the forces operating on the border. The bulk of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the first news of the enemy's advance. After burning most of the buildings and their remaining contents, Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu motor-road, and early on the 13th November his advanced parties opened fire on the British South Africa Company's rubber factory on the Chambeshi River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice was received by the District Commissioner and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted the position and suspended hostilities.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He relinquished office on the 26th September, 1923, and was succeeded by Mr. (now Sir Richard) Godda, C.M.G., C.B.E., as Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika Province of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 26th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924 the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative

Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and seven unofficial elected members. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, G.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

For the East African Governor's Conference, see under Kenya, page 330.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen, who function as Native Authorities and Courts. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District Officers. The Barotse Province is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied.

District Officers in their capacities as Native Commissioners and Magistrates have a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from Native Commissioners' Courts to Provincial Commissioners as Magistrates, and from Magistrates Courts to the High Court.

Education.

European.—For the education of European children there were in 1931 controlled Schools at Livingstone, Choma, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Broken Hill, Bwana Mkubwa, Ndola, Luanshya and Nkana offering primary Education up to Standard VII, with the additional subjects Latin, French, Algebra in Standards VI and VII and Geometry in Standard VII. There were Schools at Tara, Silver Rest, Chilongo and Fort Jameson, offering primary education up to Standard V. All these schools were under Government Management. The Convent School, Broken Hill, offering education up to the standard of the Southern Rhodesian Junior Certificate Examination and Chiposa School offering primary education up to Standard V, were controlled schools but under private management.

Boarding accommodation was available for girls at the Beit School, Choma, for boys at the Codrington School, Mazabuka, and for boys and girls at Lusaka School, all under Government management, and at the Convent School, Broken Hill, and Chiposa School, Fort Jameson, both under private management. There was also open during the year a number of uncontrolled schools with small enrolments and uncertain lives.

Native.—The Department of Native Education supervises the educational work of the Missionary Societies working in the Territory, and apportions the grants in aid of the Mission Schools which conform to the Government syllabus and requirements. There is an Advisory Board on Native Education upon which Missions, Settlers and Government Departments are represented. A Government School for the training of "Jeans" Teachers and Agricultural Demonstrators was opened at Mazabuka in 1930, connected with the Central Research Station. The Barotse National School at Mongu is also a Government Institution. In 1931, Government Elementary Schools were opened at Mazabuka and Ndola, and a Middle School at Mazabuka. In the following year a Normal Training School was opened at Mazabuka, and an Elementary and Middle School at Kasama.

Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° to 90° with a maximum of 103° and a minimum of 56°. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 55° to 75° with a maximum of 86° and a minimum of 40°. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of 120°, whilst minima round about 30° are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period May to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70% to 90% of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again. The average rainfall so far as present investigations shew is 34.18 inches per annum.

Agriculture.

The cattle and ranching industries are gradually attaining a more satisfactory position owing to increased fencing and better cattle-management amongst European-owned stock and to the dipping which has been commenced amongst Native-owned stock in the Reserves.

Owing to the temporary closing down of certain mines, the demand for food-stuffs has diminished considerably, and crops and stocks of cattle in the country are now sufficient to meet all demands made upon them.

The cattle of the Territory are singularly free from major diseases and the mortality is not high upon those farms or ranches where good cattle-mastership is practised.

The dairy industry has not developed to the extent which the local markets require. Arrangements have
now been made for the erection of a creamery at Lusaka at which very large supplies of cream can be handled.

The greater portion of the Territory is undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in its food supply, practically the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little or no general trade in food commodities. The staple native cereals are finger-millet (Eleusine coracana), Kaffir-corn (Sorghum), and Maize. The former is produced over extensive tracts of the Territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby one grain crop is grown in rotation with forest re-growths, and the gardens revert to bush after each grain crop. Other native crops are bulrush millet (Pennisetum typhoideum), ground-nuts, cassava, sweet-potatoes, and a variety of pumpkins, gourds, and beans. Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but on a small scale for private consumption and a small localized trade only. Considerable numbers of cattle are owned by natives in the Territory, but these are mainly confined to certain tribes, notably the Marosi, Balia, Matolza, and, to a less extent, the Angoni in North-eastern Rhodesia.

Many parts of the Territory are impassable to animal transport owing to the presence of the tse-tse fly.

In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management.

Maize is the chief crop. During the season 1930-31, 42,974 acres were planted and yielded 193,656 bags. The increasing use of tractors in certain districts is having an important bearing on the total yield and where these up-to-date methods, combined with adequate green manuring, are practised the results are most encouraging. Competition from the south, by grain offered at very low prices caused the matter to be taken up with the Government of the Union of South Africa. As a result, maize was removed from the list of free imports in the Customs Agreement, and a duty of approximately 4/- per bag is now charged on grain entering either territory from the other. For the time being, the importation of grain from Southern Rhodesia is prohibited on account of the restrictions imposed as a result of the outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in that Territory.

The cultivation of cotton is still confined to experimental work at the Central Research Station and on selected farms. Jasid resistant varieties have been obtained but attacks by other insects such as Stainer and Bollworm make it impossible, as yet, to state whether this crop is likely to occupy any position amongst the export crops of the Territory. Its value, however, as a rotation crop for maize makes it essential that every avenue should be explored to obtain a variety suitable to local conditions.

The position as regards tobacco is still one of some difficulty. The leaf which can be produced in the Territory has been proved to be of good quality and acceptable to the limited market in the United Kingdom. Every effort is being made to consolidate the position of Northern Rhodesia leaf on the markets by exporting only that leaf which is of good quality.

Most of the wheat produced in the Territory is handled by the Co-operative Society at Lusaka. A trade has sprung up for good boer meal and an increasing amount of white flour is being sold.

The Central Research Station, which is situated about three miles from Mazabuka on the railway line in the centre of the farming areas, was opened on the 2nd November, 1929. This station, which is a joint Agricultural and Veterinary one, is staffed and equipped to deal with general agricultural investigations of local economic importance on the one hand, and on the other, with specific researches designed to lead to the control of animal diseases of economic importance in the Territory.

Two agricultural sub-stations have now been completed, one at Fort Jameson and the other at Abercorn. These sub-stations are under the supervision of the District Agricultural Officers now stationed at these points, and in addition to the conduct of investigations of purely local significance in their respective districts, are undertaking the testing out of local application of results obtained in the more detailed investigations carried out at the Central Station and constitute centres for the dissemination of agricultural information and instruction in the areas which they serve.

Forestry.

More than 60 per cent. of the entire area of Northern Rhodesia is estimated to be more or less covered with trees and shrubs, but the forest growth, chiefly of the Savannah Woodland type, is undergoing considerable modification in composition and area as a result of native shifting cultivation and annual fires. A Forestry Branch has been instituted in recent years and three forestry officers are now carrying out investigations in various parts of the Territory. Reafforestation and protective measures have already been commenced in one forest. It is proposed to maintain certain areas as protection forests for the prevention of soil erosion and the preservation of water supplies in springs and rivers. Further areas are to be dedicated to the production of timber of the more useful indigenous species. The aerial survey at present being carried out over part of the Territory will greatly accelerate the demarcation of Forest Reserves in that region. Experimental plantations of fast growing exotic tree species are being established and private enterprise in this direction has already commenced in the mining areas.

The only commercial timber industry in the Territory at present is that of the Zambesi Saw Mills Ltd., whose operations extend from Livingstone to the Machili River under concessions granted by the Government. This Company is chiefly concerned with the extraction, by light railway, of timbers of the Kalahari sand belt type, including Mukwa, Baikiaea plurijuga; Mukwa, Pterocarpus angolensis; Mwanguira, Pterocarpus stevensoni; Mupumuna, Entandrophragma sp.; Mkamba, Afzelia quanzensis; Mugongo Ricinodendron roumensis; and Mushache, Burkea africana. The Company has contracts for supplying sleepers to the South African and Rhodesian Railways.

Land Settlement.

An Agricultural Survey Commission has reported upon the unalienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European settlement, and this Commission has advised as to the class of farming or ranching for which the land is suitable. The Government is not embarking on any extensive programme of land settlement. Crown Land and privately owned land, however, suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 2s. and 1½s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least 2,000/- capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.
Department of Mines.

The Mines Department administers the Mining Law, the Mining Titles Registration Ordinance subsidiary thereto and the mining and explosives regulations. The staff consists of the Secretary for Mines, two Inspectors of Mines, two European clerks and a native Interpreter.

The Registry of Claims and the Registry of Mining Titles are kept; stamp duty is assessed and the necessary searches are made. During 1931, this Department assisted in bringing out entirely revised mining regulations and explosives regulations, carried out general and special inspection of the mines, held enquiries, and attended at inquests.

On the Broken Hill Mine, zinc production ceased when the price reached a very low figure, but vanadium output was much increased; it has been discovered that the amount of low grade vanadium reserves of this mine is very great.

Apart from Broken Hill, the mining activities of the Territory centre chiefly on copper. The Roan Antelope Mine was in active commission from the middle of the year; its commencement of production was made without a hitch, and costs proved to be very low.

All preparations were ready at the Nkana Mine for production at the end of the year and satisfactory progress has been maintained.

The Mufulira Mine was on the point of production when the output restriction of the producers' agreement and the uncertainty of the whole position caused it to be closed down, whilst the Nchanga West Mine has also ceased its preparations pending the return of more normal times.

Geological and topographical survey has been actively carried out by the Rhokana Corporation in their Concessions, Loangwa Concessions and Rhodesia Minerals Concessions. Some gold has been produced, notably by Luiri Gold Areas Limited and the New Jessie Gold Mining (Prop.) Company Limited.

During 1931, the mineral production figures were as follows:

| Mineral          | Quantity       | Value (£) |
|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Gold             | 9,864.10 ozs. | 39,776    |
| Silver           | 548.49 ozs.   | 32        |
| Copper           | 8,927.27 tons.| 346,277   |
| Mica             | 3,098 lbs.    | 774       |
| Zinc             | 6,927.37 tons.| 81,786    |
| Vanadium         | 335,971 lbs.  | 225,661   |
| Manganese Ore    | 1,467.19 tons.| 2,200     |
| Iron Ore         | 759.00 tons.  | 379       |
| Copper Concentrates | 24,110-28 tons.| 459,194   |
| Vanadium Concentrates | 703.32 tons.| 94,424    |
| Copper, Other    | 3,215.10 tons.| 8,182     |

The labour figures at the end of 1931 were as follows:

| Category       | Europeans | Natives |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Mines          | 1,884     | 12,643  |
| Concessions    | 57        | 618     |

Means of Communication.

The Railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a single span bridge, 660 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have now been constructed from Ndola to Luanshya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nchanga via Nkana, a distance of 84 miles. Another line runs from Mokambo, in the Belgian Congo, to Mufulira, nine miles distant.

Road communications are being opened up, and dry season motor tracks are now in use from Victoria Falls (via Livingstone, Lusaka and Broken Hill) to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge (790 miles approx.); Broken Hill to Abercorn (574 miles), and thence via Mwenzo, on the border of Northern Rhodesia, to Tanganyika and Kenya Colony; this portion forming part of the Cape to Cairo Route. Lusaka and Fort Jameson are also connected by road, a distance of 406 miles, and a road, leaving the Great North Road about 46 miles north of Broken Hill, runs through the Mining Areas via Ndola, Nchanga, Solwezi, Kasempa, and Mumbwa to rejoin the Great North Road at Chisamba.

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambeshi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aerodromes, suitable for large aircraft have been established at Isoka, Broken Hill, Ndola, Mtuga, Kanona, Mpika, Chinsali, Livingstone and Leopard's Hill, and emergency landing grounds have been constructed between Mtuga and Kanona, Kanona and Mpika, at Shiwa Ngandu and between Isoka and Mbeya on the Imperial Airways route.

In addition, emergency landing grounds are situated at Fort Jameson, Mazabuka, Kalomo, Mongu, Kansanshi, Nkana and Luanshya.

The aerodromes at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Ndola and Mpika are equipped with re-fuelling masts, and are connected by telephone to the nearest Administrative officer.

Broken Hill aerodrome is equipped with a hanger capable of accommodating three Imperial Airways machines, and a ground staff is in residence both at Broken Hill and Mpika.

Air mails are received from and despatched to all countries on the England-South Africa route, the service being once weekly in each direction. Mails to and from England are despatched and received once weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails for Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyasaland.

There are 44 post offices, 18 of which are Money Order offices. The main telegraph and telephone route lies alongside the railway line from Victoria Falls to the Congo Border, with branches from Ndola to Luanshya, Ndola to Nchanga and from Nkana to Mufulira. Wireless stations at Broken Hill, Mpika, Fort Jameson, Livingstone and Mongu-Lealui are equipped for point to point communication on short wave and maintain a public service. A licensed station at Kansanshi Mine is open for restricted public service. Broken Hill and Mpika Stations also provide radio-electrical services in connection with the African International Air Route, and are equipped for communication with aircraft in flight, on a wavelength of 900 metres.

Customs Duties.

The Tariff provides for British Preference in the case of the following classes of goods, which are mainly liable to ad valorem rates of duty; clothing, blankets and rugs, cotton piece goods and all articles mainly imported for household and native use, the duty on British being 9% and the duty on Foreign varying from 15 to 25%; agricultural, electrical, mining and other industrial machinery, pipes and piping, metals and metal manufactures imported for industrial purposes, if British are free of duty and if Foreign are subject to an ad valorem duty of 5%.
Specific rates of duty apply to practically all imported foodstuffs, spirituous liquors, wines, beers and tobacco. Upon most of the foodstuffs, varying percentages of British preference from 9% to 30% are allowed; upon the liquors and tobaccos, no preference is granted except under the Customs Agreements with the neighbouring Territories in the South.
