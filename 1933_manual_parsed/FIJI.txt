FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,700 miles, from Auckland 1,100 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,053 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,130 square miles, Tavuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,063 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of from 4,000 to 4,300 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Copper ore is found in many places, but does not appear to be of sufficiently high grade to justify working. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), tin, antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Dreketi river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofua and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1921 to number 2,402, of whom two-thirds are Methodists, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra.

The natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity. A resident European commissioner is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are two native stipendiary magistrates, who have

divorce of natives, succession to proper jurisdiction and powers of native courts, magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters havin...
jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the Governor, rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotuman Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner and any number of natives, not exceeding ten). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the Colony, as ascertained at the census of 1921 is shown in the following table:

|                | Males | Females | Total |
|----------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Europeans      | 2,297 | 1,581   | 3,878 |
| Half-Castes    | 1,464 | 1,327   | 2,781 |
| Indians        | 37,015| 23,619  | 60,634|
| Polynesians    | 1,271 | 293     | 1,564 |
| Fijians        | 44,022| 40,453  | 84,475|
| Rotumans       | 1,129 | 1,106   | 2,235 |
| Chinese        | 845   | 65      | 910   |
| Others         | 431   | 358     | 789   |

| **Net increase during the preceding decade** | **8,456** | **9,269** | **17,725** |

The births among the native population in 1931 totalled 3,301, and the deaths 2,076. The birth rate was 35·34, and the death rate 22·22 per mil.

The Methodist and Roman Catholic missions gave the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1931:

- Methodist: 83,105
- Roman Catholic: 14,272

**Total**: 97,377

History.

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the Bounty, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1836, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These Commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the Chief of Bau, Maafu, who was Chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taviuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate Colony, and providing for their government.

Levuoka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva numbered 1,434 at the census of 1921.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from syphilitic and endemic diseases. Malarial fevers have never been met with.

The highest temperature at Suva in 1931 was 91 degrees on December 30th and 31st, and the lowest 62 degrees on August 29th. The total rainfall was 102·92 inches. The average annual rainfall is 117·41 inches. There is a great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to October is usually the driest period. Between November and April, the wet season, hurricanes and cyclonic storms occasionally occur, December to March being the months of greatest frequency.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 9th February, 1929. The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, the Secretary for Indian Affairs, and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and not more than thirteen nominated members, six European elected members, three native members, and three Indian elected members. The natives retain a large share of self-government. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by a triennial meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. There is a Native Regulation Board, constituted under "The Native Affairs Ordinance, 1876," which has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage and divorce of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having
reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council.

Shipping.

Suva and Levuka are ports of Registry under the Merchant Shipping Act. On the 31st December, 1931, there were on the Register 6 steam vessels of a tonnage of 5,730 tons, and 12 motor vessels of a tonnage of 788 tons.

The number of local vessels trading within the Colony and holding Sea-going Certificates from the Marine Board during 1931 was:

| Owned by | No. | Tons |
|----------|-----|------|
| Europeans | 40  | 1,569|
| Natives   | 25  | 349  |
| Others    | 17  | 207  |

Total... ... 82 2,125

The number of merchant vessels entered from overseas at the three ports of entry in the Colony during the year 1931 was 169, the total registered tonnage being 629,517; of these vessels 107 were British, tonnage 446,099; 50 American, 155,856 tons; 2 French, 6,155 tons; 1 Norwegian, 2,453 tons; 6 Swedish, 16,828 tons; 3 Panamanian, 3,126 tons.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1877 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva, on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by the Municipal Institutions Ordinance, 1909. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property.

The revenue and expenditure in 1931 were:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| £       | £           |
| Suva municipal council... ... | 48,082 | 42,762 |
| Levuka municipal council... ... | 4,470 | 4,305 |
| Total... ... | £55,552 | £47,067 |

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance of 1890, was superseded by the Education Ordinance of 1916, which was slightly amended in 1926. The present Education Ordinance of 1929 with its amendment in 1932 now annuls the previous Ordinance.

The chief features of the present Ordinance are the transference of the Rating Sections to the draft of a separate proposed rating ordinance; the more complete and effective registration of schools and teachers; the better definition of conditions of grants in aid; the revision of the powers of the Board of Education as newly constituted in 1926, and the general outline of certain desired features of the elementary school curriculum and the management of schools.

Under the Ordinance the only School Districts at present constituted are those of Suva and Levuka for Europeans.

The are two Grammar Schools for Europeans in Suva, one for boys and one for girls, with hostels attached, and a public school in Levuka, all under Government control. The average roll number during 1931 at the Boy Grammar School, Suva, was 144; at the Girls Grammar School, Suva (where boys under 8 are taken), 210. The average roll in 1931 for the Levuka Public School was 108 (boys and girls).

The Queen Victoria Memorial School at Nasinu, near Suva, is intended to provide for the higher education of natives, and is maintained from public revenue. The number of boys on the roll during 1931 was 81.

Schools for the primary education of Fijians may be conducted by the Methodist, Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Seventh Day Adventist Missions, by the Provincial Councils, by any other properly constituted authority or by the Government. Six Provincial schools have been established by the Government at Lau, Taveuni, Lodon, Kadavu, Nadi, and Sawani, in charge of European Headmasters.

At the end of 1931 there were 178 Government and assisted schools, 116 for Fijians, 43 for Indians, 6 receiving both Fijians and Indians, 11 for Europeans and half-castes, 1 for Chinese and 1 for Melanesians. They have 13,630 pupils, of whom 8,452 were Fijians, including 37 Melanesians, 3,908 were Indians, 1,088 were Europeans and half-castes, and 32 Chinese.

There were in addition 93 recognised schools for Fijians, 18 for Indians, 2 for Europeans. In these schools, 4,820 Fijians, 623 Indians, and 141 Europeans were enrolled.

333 teachers were registered and 567 recognised at the end of 1931.

The estimated expenditure on Education for 1932 is 43,484£.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. Under Ordinance I., of 1907, a Government Savings Bank was opened in 1908. At the end of 1931, there were 10,858 depositors and 173,709£ in deposits. Arrangements were made in 1914 for the issue of Government Currency Notes. At the end of 1931, the circulation of Government Currency Notes was 406,383£.

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva, Levuka, and Lautoka, and the Bank of New Zealand at the two former places.

Industries, Trade, and Customs.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. The cotton industry is again receiving attention and 78,532 lbs. of cotton were exported in 1931. Owing to the Commonwealth Government having imposed a prohibitive duty in 1921 on imported bananas, the entire fruit trade of Fiji has been diverted to the New Zealand market.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas, pineapples and citrus fruits. Exports, the produce of the Colony, fell in value from 1,378,371£ in 1930 to 932,026£ in 1931.
In 1931, exports of sugar, copra, and fruit were:—Sugar, 67,937 tons, value £24,310; Copra, 18,917 tons, value £77,786; Bananas, 194,875 bunches, value £7,368; Fresh Pines, 5,607 cases, value £1,510.

The other principal exports in 1931 consisted of:—Beche-de-mer, 2,864 cwt., value £16,045; Biscuits, 149,630 lbs., value £3,325; Butter, 1,612 cwt., value £7,519; Coconuts, 300,860 nuts, value £906; Canned Fins, 297,301 lbs., value £5,961; Hides, 4,208 hides, value £2,283; Molasses, 9,019 tons, value £9,019; Shell Trocas, 183 tons, value £7,371; Soap, plain, fresh, 9,926 cwt., value £3,465; and Vegetables, fresh, 9,926 cwt., value £4,982.

Considerable quantities of rice are grown and a Government rice mill has been established.

Dairying is an established industry.

Many parts of the Colony seem admirably adapted for cattle and sheep raising.

A biscuit factory and an oil mill have been established in Suva.

The Customs Tariff is mainly on an ad valorem duty basis, with the exception of a few articles including spirits, tobacco, machinery, timber, meats, wines, petroleum products on which there is a specific rate of duty.

Goods the produce or manufacture of the British Empire are admitted at British Preferential rates of duty.

The total trade of the Colony in 1931 was £1,929,701.

The total trade was divided as follows:

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| United Kingdom | 27.7% | 12.1% |
| Other British Possessions | 57.9% | 73.6% |
| Foreign Countries | 11.6% | 13.2% |
| Parcels Post | — | 2.7% |
| Ships Stores | — | 3.1% |

The following figures show the trade of the Colony during the last five years:

| Year | Imports | Exports | Total Trade |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1927 | 1,223,303L | 1,997,374L | 3,220,677L |
| 1928 | 1,483,169L | 2,701,251L | 4,184,420L |
| 1929 | 1,468,609L | 1,775,998L | 3,244,607L |
| 1930 | 1,219,184L | 1,484,526L | 2,703,710L |
| 1931 | 929,514L | 1,000,187L | 1,929,701L |

The fall in the value of produce which began to make itself felt in 1929 was intensified during 1931 and the markets registered prices which have never been so low. In addition, two hurricanes were experienced during the 1930-31 season.

The value of imports from the principal countries during the last five years was as follows:

| Country | 1927 | 1928 | 1929 | 1930 | 1931 |

Means of Communication.

There is a direct quarterly cargo service with the United Kingdom by the New Zealand Shipping Company's Line of steamers.

There is regular steam communication with Australia and New Zealand, a monthly service with Canada, and a monthly service with U.S.A. Inter-island communication is maintained by regular steamer or cutter services.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

The Imperial Postal Order system has been adopted by this Colony.

Letters from England sent via San Francisco or Vancouver, reach Fiji in about 28 days.

There is a Government telephone line from Nanukuloua to Tavua, a distance of 40 miles. There is a telegraph line between Suva and Levuka, a distance of 54 miles. A system of wireless telegraphy has been established in the Colony, and there are now stations at Suva and Lautoka in the island of Viti Levu, at Labasa and Savusavu in the island of Vanua Levu, at Waiyevo, Taviuni. Telephone Exchanges have been established at Suva, Levuka, Nausori, Davulevu, Navua, Taviuni and Savu Savu.

There is no railway in the Colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. own various tram lines connecting their estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands, and more are in process of construction. Suva is connected by cable with Southport (Queensland) and Auckland, via Norfolk Island, and with Vancouver, via Fanning Island.
