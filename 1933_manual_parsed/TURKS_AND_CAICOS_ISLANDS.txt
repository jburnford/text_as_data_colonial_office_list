TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is about 166 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 6½ miles long and 1½ miles broad. According to the census of 1921 Grand Turk contains 1,668 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population which in 1921 was 5,612. The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

These Islands were discovered in 1512 by Ponce de Leon, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas. In 1873 they were annexed to Jamaica and still remain one of its dependencies.

Two hurricanes passed over these Islands in 1926, on July 24th and September 16th respectively, and did great damage. The second one was the most disastrous, as regards damage to property, in the history of the Dependency.

Another hurricane passed over these Islands on September 14th, 1928, which did considerable damage and caused the loss of 17 lives.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the average quantity annually gathered being about 1,600,000 bushels, equal to 56,000 tons. 764,019 bushels were exported in 1931 valued at £12,895l. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1931, 26,749 lbs., was valued at £2,016l. 1,121,800 dried conchs (shell fish), valued at £1,122l. 257 lbs. turtle shell valued at £257l. 8,492 lbs. sial valued at £47.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st Dec., 1931, 50 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,040 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

The bulk of the imports (£18,304l. in 1931 out of total of £24,291l.) are from the U.S. of America. The exports are chiefly to Canada and the United States.

An ad valorem customs duty of 15% is levied on most imports and specific duties on alcoholic liquors, tobacco, flour and a few other articles.

The British preferential tariff is 10%.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 78°, the extreme range being from 60° to 93°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1931 amounted to 45½ inches, the average rainfall during the five years 1927-1931 was 30½ inches.

Means of Communication.

There is a mail, passenger, and freight service between New York and Grand Turk about twice a month by steamers of the Royal Netherlands West India Mail, and also between Jamaica and Turks Islands once a month by sailing vessel.

The Elders and Fyffes Line make occasional calls on their way to Jamaica when passengers offer and on such occasions take mails to Jamaica.

The rate of letter postage is 2½d. per ounce to all British Possessions; 2½d. to the U.S.A., and to all other countries 3½d. per ounce.

There are no railways in these Islands.

Internal mails are carried between the several islands by small sailing-craft engaged in local trade.

Mails to and from England and other parts of the world are dispatched and received via New York.

Grand Turk is an important cable junction, there being cables to Jamaica, to Barbados and to Bermuda.

The Government radio-telegraph system provides service between Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour, and Salt Cay, and with ships at sea within short range.

There is a public telephone service at Grand Turk.

Education.

There are ten elementary schools supported by Government, with 867 pupils enrolled in 1931 and an average attendance of 614. The schools are entirely unsectarian and free.

There is a Government Secondary School at Grand Turk.

Cambridge Local Examinations are held annually at Grand Turk.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1890, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of five shillings, ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1931, 860 depositors, with 13,613l. deposits.

Constitution.

By Jamaica Law No. 6 of 1926 which came into operation on the 1st day of August 1926, the
Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner, who by virtue of his office is President, and seven other persons, three of whom are holders of offices under the Crown, appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.

Kenya may be divided into three main zones where there is usually rainfall.

The Nyanza and Kikuyu districts have rainfall from 40 to 80 inches annually.

On the Coast there is rainfall from April to November, generally "long" rains except from October to December. These regions have a tropical climate except during the cool season from October to April. In the highlands, the climate is invigorating with cool nights and a mean maximum shade temperature of 31°F., and the mean rainfall at Nairobi was 27 inches.

Banks.

The currency of Kenya consisted of the Indian rupee with smaller local coins and notes, all expressed in rupees. The British sovereign was also used, but its exchange value of the rupee had been fixed for many years by the Colonial Office. It began to rise in 1917 and continued to do so. It was then decided to issue a new currency for the East Africa Protectorate, the Colony of Kenya, and Tanganyika Territory. The new currency was to consist of notes, but subsequently it was decided that the coinage should be expressed in shillings instead of rupees, the 50 cent coin being called a shilling. Some of the old coins were retained but no rupee coins. The new currency was introduced in 1921, and arrangements were made for the exchange of the Indian rupee, which was still legal tender until July 1, 1921. The nickel-brass coins (5, 10, 25 cents) of a rupee have been introduced, and new copper-bronze coins (5, 10, 25 cents) have been introduced.

The Currency Commissioners are responsible for the currency of the Colony and Tanganyika Territory in the hands of the East African Bank Limited, London, represented by the following branches:

- East African Bank Limited, Head Office: 12, Lombard Street, London, E.C.4.
- East African Bank Limited, Branches: Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Kitale, and Kampala.

The National Bank of Commerce Limited, Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kampala, and the Colonial and Overseas Bank Limited, Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kampala, are also represented.
Land and Products.

As the pursuit of agriculture is possible from sea level to altitudes of over 9,000 feet, climatic conditions are extremely varied and tropical, sub-tropical and temperate crops are grown.

Considerable quantities of hides are exported from all parts of the Colony, but the principal producing areas developed at present are at elevations of 4,000 feet and over.

In the highlands coffee, maize, wattle and tea are the principal crops and in the lower parts of the Colony, including the Coast, sisal, maize, coconuts, cotton, sugar cane and miscellaneous grains and oil seeds are grown.

The output of sugar, potatoes, beans, groundnuts, simsim, cotton and other crops and fruits of minor importance is being steadily increased. Exports of agricultural commodities are increasing steadily and in 1930 were valued at £23,167,457.

Whereas considerable quantities of foodstuffs for the non-native population were imported in former years many of these are now being replaced by home grown supplies.

Extensive pasture grounds exist throughout the highlands and maintain considerable herds of grade and native stock. The dairy industry under European supervision is in a thriving condition and butter and cheese is prepared, and increased supplies of the former are being exported.

Fishing industries are established on the Coast and Lake Victoria and provide valuable supplies for local consumption.

The forest products of the Coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony, and gum copal. The highland forests contain large quantities of pencil Cedar and several other good timbers such as Podocarpus, Olive, and East African Camphor, also large areas of bamboo suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.

The mineral resources of the Colony are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; good quality mica has been discovered in the Suk district; mica diatomite and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kajiado, Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba and a gypsum deposit has been discovered near Simba; gold prospecting activities exist south of Kisii. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

The total area of land alienated as at December 31st, 1930, was 6,894,080 acres, of which 6,377,899 acres were leasehold. In addition, there are 364,180 acres of Township and Government Reserves. Sale of leases of land by public auction has been resumed.

Trade and Customs.

Since 1917, Kenya and Uganda have been one administrative unit for purposes of Customs.

In 1923, a uniform Tariff for Kenya and Uganda, operating also in Tanganyika Territory, was adopted, and free trade between Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika Territory in goods, the growth produce or manufacture of each of the territories was established. In August, 1927, unrestricted trading was extended to imported goods passing between the territories, single payment of duty only being chargeable, and the Customs Revenue involved being credited to the consuming territory by inter-departmental entry.

In April, 1930, a uniform modernised Tariff was enacted in the three territories simultaneously.

Certain specially protected commodities (wheat flour, sugar, timber, etc.) are subject to a "suspended duty"; i.e., each Government has the right to vary the rate charged in its own territory up to the amount specified in the Tariff. At the same time each Government has undertaken not to remove any of the "suspended duties" without prior consultation with the other Governments concerned.

On 16th June, 1931, the Consumption Tax previously leviable on Wines and Spirits cleared for consumption in Kenya was incorporated in the common Tariff and certain increases in the rates of duty chargeable on vehicles and parts (including tyres and tubes) were imposed in the three territories.

On Dec. 4th, 1931, the tariff was amended to remove minor anomalies and to increase the duty chargeable on various commodities including tea, ale and beer, certain types of sugar, lubricating oils and greases, and spirits requisites: provision also being made for the application of a suspended duty of the 2/2 per 100 lbs on rice, sh 1/50 per 100 lbs on wheat in the grain and an additional sh 1/50 per 100 lbs on wheat flour.

The import tariff as it now stands admits free of duty goods essential to the agricultural, industrial, educational, and scientific development of the territories, and has been designed as far as possible to protect imports essential to the opening up and development of the country and to foster local production of agricultural and other commodities in which Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika Territory, taken as an economic unit, are, or can be made self-supporting.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of Trade Imports (excluding Imports on Government Account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya Ports, were as follows:

| Years | Trade Imports | Total Customs Receipts | Tonnage entered |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------|
