STRAITS SETTLEMENTS

Malaya comprises the Colony of the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, and the Unfederated States of Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Perlis. Malaya is also regarded as including the State of Brunei, in the island of Borneo, of which the Governor of the Straits Settlements is High Commissioner and which like the Malay States in the Peninsula is in treaty relationship with Great Britain.

The Straits Settlements comprise Singapore, Penang, Malacca, and Labuan. The first three were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115). Labuan, a separate Colony since 1848, was incorporated with the Straits Settlements as part of the Settlement of Singapore in 1907, and became a separate Settlement in 1912.

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 220 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, to which it is joined by a causeway across the Straits of Johore, which are about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the Settlement, which now comprises also Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang comprises the island of Penang, Province Wellesley, and the territory of the Dindings. Penang island is about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 110 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait about 2 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the Settlement averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 46 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian river (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 280 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long., on Penang island.

The Dindings, area about 180 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and coasting steamers call regularly.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 miles from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 640 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Cocos or Keelung Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Covion, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers (1931), 1,142.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 60 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides; its greatest length being about 12 miles, and its greatest breadth about 9 miles. The inhabitants, who number (1931) 1,069, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employees of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance. (See also under History).

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,631 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907, and in 1912 the island became a separate Settlement. An account of Labuan will be found below, page 365.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time. A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1908 to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements. An account of Brunei will be found below, page 388.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17 March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the
commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became a place of reduced commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. At first unimportant, that trade has now assumed enormous proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula. The trade of Malacca as an entrepôt port for central Malaya has recently revived.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 280 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1806 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end about 1377, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819 by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

**Constitution, Law and Justice.**

The Government consists of a Governor aided by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council consists of 6 official members, excluding the Governor who presides, such other official members as the Governor may nominate, at present 3 in number, and 3 unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of 13 official members and 13 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local Ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the Colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, and a Criminal Procedure Code based on that in India.

There is a Supreme Court which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months and quarterly at Malacca; and civil sittings monthly at Singapore and Penang and once a quarter at Malacca. Ordinance 5/1931 provides for the institution of a Court of Criminal Appeal.

**Climate.**

The climate shows little variation during the year. The mean temperature ([Maximum + Minimum]) during 1931 was:—Singapore (Mount Faber) 81-6° F.; Penang (Hospital) 82-7° F.; Province Wellesley (Meteorological Station, Butterworth) 81-6° F.; Malacca (Bukit China) 80-1° F.

The mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures varied as follows:

| Mean monthly maximum | Mean monthly minimum |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Highest ° F.         | Lowest ° F.          |
| Singapore            | 90-4 Feb.            |
| Penang               | 93-7 Mar.            |

The extremes of temperature (Highest maximum and Lowest minimum) recorded were:

| Highest ° F. | Lowest ° F. |
|--------------|-------------|
| Singapore    | 94 on several days in March, April and May. |
| Penang       | 97 on three days in February and March. |

There are no well marked dry and wet seasons, rain falling throughout the year. Records for 52 years at Kandang Kerbau, Singapore, show that the average rainfall was 95-07 inches, February being the driest month with an average of 6-62 inches and December the wettest with 10-55 inches. The average number of wet days in 22 years was 183.

Rainfall has been recorded at Kandang Kerbau since 1876, the wettest year being 1913 with 135-92 inches and the driest 1888 with 63-21 inches.

In Penang the average annual rainfall for 7 years was 105-12 inches, October being the wettest month with an average of 22-38 inches and February the driest with 2-66 inches. The average number of wet days was 195.

The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz.—S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But at the coastal stations the diurnal land and sea breezes are often stronger than the prevailing monsoons.

The rainfall recorded in 1931 was:

| Location                  | Total No. of inches | No. of wet days |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Singapore (Mount Faber)   | 100-67              | 201             |
| Penang (Hospital)         | 103-98              | 198             |
| Malacca (Bukit China)     | 107-19              | 207             |
| Butterworth (Province Wellesley) | 79-87 | 186 |
| Labuan (Hospital)         | 138-74              | 172             |

Commerce.

The foreign trade of the Colony of the Straits Settlements is not separately distinguished, having since 1922 been merged in that of the Malayan Registration area which includes the Colony, the Federated Malay States, and the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu. This trade passes principally through the ports of Singapore and Penang in the Colony, and Port Swettenham in the F.M.S.

The principal agricultural products are rubber, coconuts, pineapples, palm oil, and rice.

The principal imports comprise foodstuffs, petroleum products, tin ore, rubber, clothing, and machinery; the chief exports, raw materials, particularly rubber, smelted tin, copra, and palm oil, with a few manufactured articles. There is an important transit trade in the ports of Singapore and Penang.

The ports of the Straits Settlements are free ports and are subject to no import or export duties. There are excise duties on liquor, tobacco, petroleum and motor vehicles.

The following show the total imports and exports for the six years up to 1931 and the values of some of the principal articles in 1931.

Shipping.

Singapore and George Town (Penang) are ports of registry: Singapore had on the 31st December, 1931, 860 steam, motor, and sailing vessels registered, of a total gross tonnage of 144,424 tons.

The ports of Singapore and Penang are administered under Ordinance No. 126 (Merchant Shipping) by the Marine Department, and by Harbour Boards under Ordinance No. 130 (Ports) in each Settlement (Singapore and Penang) for the management of the wharves. Malacca is also a port at which ocean-steamer call. The number of merchant steamers of over 75 tons net register with cargo and in ballast, and the aggregate tonnage entering the ports in 1931 were:

| Port   | Nos. | Tons. |
|--------|------|-------|
| Singapore | 7,065 | 14,631,765 |
| Penang  | 2,701 | 6,364,404 |
| Malacca | 715   | 885,866 |

The following table shows the comparison between British tonnage and the total tonnage of merchant steamers of over 75 tons net register with cargo and ballast, entered and cleared in the ports of the Straits Settlements, Singapore, Penang, Malacca.
Labuan, and Christmas Island, for each of the years from 1927 to 1931:

**Shipping Entered and Cleared, Exclusive of Native Craft.**

| Year | Tonnage | Tonnage |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1927 | 19,675,050 | 39,415,910 |
| 1928 | 20,845,077 | 42,686,244 |
| 1929 | 21,081,873 | 46,117,347 |
| 1930 | 21,334,366 | 46,282,734 |
| 1931 | 19,387,071 | 43,640,442 |

**Note.—** The definition of merchant steamers was altered, with effect from January, 1931, from vessels of 50 tons net register and over, to vessels of over 75 tons net register. The figures for the years 1927-1930 have thus been altered on this basis, i.e., decreased by 770, so as to afford a more accurate comparison with those of 1931.

There are also Government telegraph lines from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Pahang, Trengganu, Negri Sembilan, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Siam, Johore, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur (503 miles) was opened for traffic in 1909. There are 808 miles of telegraph line, 14 nautical miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley, and there are 35,424 miles of telephone line.

The telephone exchange in Singapore is worked by Oriental Telephone Company Limited, and the exchanges in Penang, Province Wellesley, and Malacca are worked by the Post Office. There are 8,373 connections, including extensions to the three systems.

A telephone service between Singapore, Johore and the Federated Malay States was opened in 1931. This was followed by the opening of the new service between Singapore and Penang towards the end of 1931.

(iv) Railways and Roads.

The Federated Malay States Railways system connects with the Royal State Railways of Siam, the distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,195 miles, the journey taking 60 hours. Sections connect the main line with ports on the West Coast. A line from Gemas in Negri Sembilan, through Pahang and Kelantan, connects with the Royal Siamese State Railways on the East Coast. A deviation on Singapore Island to bring the terminus to the vicinity of the wharves was completed in 1932.

There is a total length of 920 miles of metalled roads in the Colony, 2,840 miles in the Federated Malay States, and 1,338 miles in the Unfederated Malay States, making a total of 5,098 miles.

Education.

The control of all Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children. The Government assists Chinese vernacular education by grants-in-aid to such schools as apply for them and are satisfactorily conducted. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided in Government or grant-in-aid schools, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are secular.

Raffles College was opened in Singapore in 1929 for a higher education in English. There is a Reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1931 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls) | 23 | 10,102 | 9,697 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls) | 30 | 16,180 | 15,401 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls) | 217 | 23,009 | 21,586 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls) | 68 | 6,237 | 5,972 |
| Total | 338 | 55,528 | 52,658 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also at that time legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed in England in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin was of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.
Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of £60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4½d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold and by an order of the King in Council, dated the 17th day of May, 1920, the fineness of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced.

Local silver and nickel coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and copper coins are legal tender up to $1. The half-dollar is unlimited legal tender. Under an Ordinance passed in 1917 currency notes of denominations 25 cents and ten cents were issued to the public owing to shortage of subsidiary silver. These notes were legal tender to the extent of $2, and have since been withdrawn from circulation.

By the Currency Ordinance passed in 1923 the various funds controlled by the Currency Commissioners were amalgamated into one fund styled the Currency Guarantee Fund.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the National City Bank of New York; the Banque de l'Indo-Chine; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; and Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, Chinese Commercial Bank, The Yokohama Specie Bank, The Ho Hong Bank, The Overseas Chinese Bank, the China & Southern Bank, Lee Wah Bank, the P. and O. Banking Corporation, Thomas Cook & Son (Bankers) Limited, Kwong Lee Banking Company, Eastern Bank Limited, and the National Commercial and Savings Bank, Limited.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation at the end of 1931 was $136,690 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the end of 1931 was $67,414,796. These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank at each Settlement.

An attempt was made by the East India Company's servants, who were expelled from Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish a trading station in Labuan, but the project was soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the history of the island begins with its cession to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei. It was then uninhabited. The reason for the cession, given in the treaty by which the island was handed over to Great Britain, was that it was "desirable that British Ships shall have some port where they may careen and refit, and deposit such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary for the carrying on of the trade with the dominions of Brunei," and the consideration given by Great Britain was an undertaking to suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was first occupied only as a naval station under the control of a naval officer, and the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was deferred until 1848. From that date until the end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate Colony. Until 1869 it was assisted by grants-in-aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a head, and, as it was thought that the island could be more economically governed in connection with the territories of the British North Borneo Company, the administration was entrusted, from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the Company, whose principal representative in Borneo was given a commission as Governor of Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 1905, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1907, Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and declared part of the settlement of Singapore. On the 1st of December, 1912, the island was constituted a separate Settlement.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded, great hopes of the success of the new settlement were based upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, but hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success.

In 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-
constructed under the name of the New Central
Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking
to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company,
in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December,
1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited.
The mines have been closed since the beginning of
1911.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly
safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 15 feet can
go alongside the Government jetties.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton

Labuan is a market for much of the produce of the
neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu
Archipelago, such as sago, rice, sugar, cigarettes,
para rubber, jelutong, copra, fresh vegetables, fresh
fruits, cattle and pigs, which are forwarded by the
Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are
reared, and over 10,600 acres are estimated to be under
cultivation.

There is a branch of the Government Post Office
Savings Bank in Labuan. Harrisons and Crosfield
(Borneo) Ltd. are the local Sub-Agents of the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The
currency is that of the Straits Settlements.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays and other
natives from Brunei and the mainland of Borneo,
and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

There are four Government schools, viz.—The
Government English School, the Vernacular School
for boys, the Vernacular School for Girls in Victoria,
and the Vernacular School in Bukit Kallam. In
addition there are five private schools, viz.:—St.
Anne's School (Roman Catholic Mission), Chung
Hwa School, Chi Win School, Phin Min School and
Chung Hwa Girls' School.

A reservoir owned by the Government supplies
the town of Victoria and shipping with drinking
water.

The Eastern Extension, Australasian and China
Telegraph Company has a station on the island con-
nected by cable with Singapore, Hong Kong, and
North Borneo. The nearest point in telegraphic
communication with Europe is Singapore.

The Brunei Government maintains a Wireless
Station which communicates with the Stations
erected in the neighbouring countries of Brunei,
Sarawak, and North Borneo.

A weekly service of steamers plying between
Singapore, North Borneo Ports, and the Philippines
provides Labuan with regular communication with
these places; there are, in addition, local coasting
steamers.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. Ships
exercising their crews.

The chief sources of revenue are harbour dues,
land rents and licences.

CHRISTMAS ISLAND.

Christmas Island with an area of 62 sq. mi. lies
in the Indian Ocean, latitude 10° 30' and longitude
105° 40' E. 233 miles S. 8 E. of Java Head, and 529
miles N. 79 E. from the Cocos Island. It is densely
wooded and of irregular shape, about 12½ miles long
(at the longest point) and about 4½ miles wide (at the
narrowest point). The climate is healthy with average
maximum and minimum temperatures 84° F. and
75° F. There is a prevalent E.S.E. trade wind. The
Island has been known to navigators since about the
middle of the 17th century. It was formally annexed
on the 6th June, 1889. In 1900 it was placed under
the administration of the Governor of the Straits
Settlements and incorporated with the settlement
of Singapore. The Island is administered by a
District Officer, who is a member of the Malayan
Civil Service. There is a small force of Sikh
Police drafted from the S.S. police force. All the
inhabitants (mainly Chinese and Malay), with the
exception of the District Officer and his staff, are
employed by the Christmas Island Phosphate
Company, Ltd., registered in London, which works
the large natural deposits of phosphate of lime to
which the Island owes its importance. In 1923 a
wireless station was installed, and the Island is now
in direct communication with Singapore. A school
was established in 1931, and a teacher supplied by
Government. Population 1931, 31st December, 715
(adult males 619, adult females 57, and children 39).
Revenue 1931, 12,884£. Expenditure 1931, 3,629£.
(including salaries of D.O. and Sikh Police Force,
2,478£.). Imports 1931, 61,446£., chiefly machinery
and engineering stores. Export 1931, 130,622£.

of the latter 8,904 were for British and 30,812 for
Japanese ports.

MALAYA:

FEDERATED MALAY STATES.

The Federated Malay States comprise four States:
Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang.

Perak.

Perak is ruled by a dynasty that claims descent
from the last Malay Sultan of Malacca. In the 17th
century it was overrun by the Acehnese, and at some
time after 1838 a Johore prince, the husband of a
Perak princess, was sent by Aceh to rule it under
the title of Sultan Mudzaffar Shah. From 1860
onwards, the Dutch endeavoured to get a monopoly
of the tin exported from Perak, establishing near
the mouth of the Perak river several factories, which
the Malays, from time to time, cut off and destroyed.
In 1785 the Sultan made a treaty with the Dutch.

British influence began early in the 19th century.
A treaty with Penang in 1818 secured to British
subjects the right to free trade in Perak. In 1826 a
British arbitrator settled the boundary between
Perak and Selangor. By the Burney Treaty with
Siam, in 1826, the independence of Perak and Selangor
was recognised, though the Sultan of Perak was
permitted to send tribute to Siam if he desired. In
the same year the Sultan ceded to the British the
Dindings and the island of Pangkor as posts for the
suppression of piracy, and agreed to rely solely on the
protection of Great Britain. From 1872 to 1874
there was almost continuous fighting of more or less
severity between rival factions of Chinese in the
Larut district where valuable tin deposits had been
found.

Having regard to the anarchy which prevailed,
Sir Andrew Clarke, in 1874, induced the Perak chiefs
to sign the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874),
to maintain his rule and the appointment of a British Resident. In 1883, Jelebu applied for a British Officer; and Rembau agreed to refer all its disputes to the British Government, and in 1887 accepted a British adviser. In 1889, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti and the Rulers of Tampin and Rembau asked for a Resident, and agreed to a confederation known as "the Old Negri Sembilan." In 1896, the Resident of this confederation took charge of Sungai

advanced being considered as loans; an took to raise and equip a force of India service throughout the States, and to supply of these troops on requisition for the defense Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

* The title of this post has since been altered Chief Secretary to Government.

Having regard to the anarchy which prevailed, Sir Andrew Clarke, in 1874, induced the Perak chiefs to sign the Pankor Treaty (20th January, 1874).
and to accept thereby a Resident whose advice should be "asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching Malay religion and customs." The murder of the first British Resident (Mr. J. W. Biroh) in 1875 led to a military expedition and the banishment of the Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair. The country soon settled; and the Malay constitution was restored under a Sultan protected by the British Government.

Selangor.

In the 14th century, Klang, which is now a district of Selangor, is said to have been subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the next century it was given to a Penghulu of the family of the Bendaharans of old Malacca, and a son of Sultan Mansur Shah (1458-1477 A.D.) of Malacca was made ruler of Jeram, near Langat. During the period of Portuguese ascendancy, little is known of the Selangor coast. The Dutch opened factories for the purchase of tin at Kuala Selangor and at Kuala Linggi. In 1718 Daeng Chelak, a Bugis chief, who had married a Johore princess, settled at Kuala Selangor, and about 1780 their descendant was recognised as Sultan Salehuddin by the Sultan of Perak. The throne has remained in the same family ever since. In 1783, the Dutch blockaded Kuala Selangor and forced the Sultan to acknowledge the suzerainty of Holland.

In 1818 the Sultan of Selangor made a commercial treaty with the East India Company at Penang. In 1874 anarchy prevailed amongst the Malay chiefs at Selangor, and pirates ravaged the coastal trade. The Sultan's difficulties were such that he was glad to accept a British Resident and to come under the protection of Great Britain.

Negri Sembilan.

This federation of "Nine States" consists of the four major States of Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the five minor States of Ulu Muar, Jempul, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, and Inas. Sungai Ujong is mentioned in a Javanese poem in 1365 as being subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the 15th century it was ruled by Chiefs of the old kingdom of Malacca. Nearly all the Malay inhabitants of the "Nine States" are descendants from immigrants from Menangkabau in Sumatra. Portuguese accounts prove that this immigration had begun in the 16th century. The original Malay federation consisted of Sungai Ujong, Klang (now a district of Selangor), Jelebu, Rembau, Naning (now part of Malacca), Segamat (now in Johore), Pasir Besar (also in Johore, its place having been taken by Johol), Jelai (now Inas), and Ulu Pahang, the region between the Ulu Serling and Temerloh. After the wresting of Malacca from the Portuguese by the Dutch and the Johore Malays in 1641, Johore took a leading part in Negri Sembilan politics until 1773, when the chiefs of the four major States brought from Sumatra a Yam Tuan named Raja Melewar, ancestor of the Yang present di-pertuan Besar.

In 1874, the Dato' Klana, Chief of Sungai Ujong, the most important of the "Nine States," invited and obtained the assistance of the British Government to maintain his rule and the appointment of a British Resident. In 1883, Jelebu applied for a British Officer; and Rembau agreed to refer all its disputes to the British Government, and in 1887 accepted a British adviser. In 1889, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti and the Rulers of Tampin and Rembau asked for a Resident, and agreed to a confederation known as "the Old Negri Sembilan." In 1896, the Resident of this confederation took charge of Sungai Ujong and of Jelebu, and the modern Negri Sembilan was constituted. Finally, in 1898, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti was elected titular Ruler of the whole State.

Pahang.

Chao Ju Kua, a Chinese, writing about 1225, mentions Pahang as being subject to the old Sumatran Buddhist Kingdom of Sri Vijaya. Later, Pahang and Tioman are claimed as conquests of Majapahit. In the 16th century, Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca captured the Ruler of Pahang, and married his daughter. Before the Malacca royal house died out, in 1698, its Pahang branch provided several Rulers for the senior throne of Johore, which directly represented the Malacca dynasty. Later, Pahang fell under the suzerainty of the new Sultans of Johore, who, when they removed to Lingga, left a Dato' Bendahara in charge of Pahang.

In 1887 Sir Frederick Weld negotiated a treaty with the Bendahara of Pahang, promising British help in the event of external attack, and arranging for a British agent to be stationed at his capital. At the same time, the title of Sultan was substituted for that of Dato' Benjahara. In 1888, the Sultan applied for and obtained British protection, and the appointment of a Resident.

Constitution of the States.

The supreme authority in each State is vested in the Sultan, or the ruler, in State Council. His Highness the Sultan or ruler presides over the State Council. In 1932, the State Councils were reconstituted on the wider basis. In each of the four States they now include besides the British Resident, Malay chiefs and officials of the State, a number of unofficial members representative of Malay, European, Chinese, and Indian interests.

In Perak and Negri Sembilan there are second chambers which are concerned principally with matters of Malay customs and religion.

The Federation.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries into a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government, while all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand. The States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States,* to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. They agreed to follow the Resident-General's advice in all matters of administration other than those touching Islam. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remained unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

* The title of this post has since been altered to Chief Secretary to Government.
It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. At this meeting many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

In 1909, a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." Under an Agreement concluded in 1927 the Federal Council was reconstituted with the High Commissioner as President, twelve official, and eleven unofficial members to be nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. At least four of the unofficial members are, if possible, to be Malays.

Since the reconstitution of the council in 1927, the number of members has been increased by the addition of two officials and one unofficial. The Federal Council generally meets three times a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the four States. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

Climate.

The temperature of the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula has but a small annual range. On the East Coast, however, the North-East Monsoon, lasting from November until March, causes a distinct contrast with the rest of the year with regard to temperature, wind and rainfall. At Jelebu, in Negri Sembilan, the driest station where records have been kept, the average rainfall for 1891-1929 was 65 inches, but in the mountains the average yearly rainfall is very high, being nearly 250 inches near Taiping. The heat is at times oppressive, although 100° F. has never been recorded in the shade, but the nights generally are cool. On some of the higher mountains (5,000 feet) the night temperature has been known to fall to 42° F. In the daytime there is almost always a breeze to modify the heat. The Peninsula lies within the region of the South-West and North-East Monsoons, but the only really strong regular wind is the North-East Monsoon, which strikes the East Coast from the China Sea. Violent squalls, known as "Sumatras," are not infrequent on the West Coast of the Peninsula between April and October. Generally they are of short duration and occur during the night.

Population.

The result of the census taken in 1931, show that the population of the Federated Malay States has increased during the decade from 1,324,890 to 1,713,096 or by 29·3%.

The racial composition of the population may be roughly analysed as follows:

| Race                  | Population |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Malays of British Malaya | 443,618    |
| Other Peoples of Malay Archipelago | 150,113    |
| Chinese               | 711,540    |
| Indians               | 379,996    |
| Europeans             | 6,350      |
| Eurasians             | 4,261      |
| Others                | 17,228     |
| **Total**             | **1,713,096** |

These figures indicate the predominant influence of immigration as does the fact that only 47·2% of the population enumerated was born in British Malaya.

Railways.

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also in the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis, and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (121 miles), extending from Johore Bahru at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, and Province Wellesley to Prai—the port opposite Penang Harbour—488 miles from Singapore. From Bukit Mertajam near Prai the line proceeds northwards through the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis, to the Siamese frontier station of Padang Besar, 580 miles from Singapore. Through traffic with the Royal State Railways of Siam was opened on July 1st, 1918, the distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,195 miles. Through services are in operation between Penang and Bangkok, the journey occupying 27 hours.

The East Coast Line proceeds northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan, Pahang and Kelantan to Tumpat on the North-East Coast of the Unfederated State of Kelantan, 328 miles from Gemas. At 141 miles the line passes through Kuala Lipis, the Capital of Pahang and at 187½ miles crosses the Pahang-Kelantan Border. Guillemaud Bridge across the Kelantan River at 292 miles is the largest bridge in Malaya. It is 2,166 feet long and consists of 5 spans of 250 feet and 5 spans of 160 feet. The East Coast Line provides an alternative route to Siam.

An extension from Pasir Mas in Kelantan runs in a westerly direction for 113 miles to the Golok River at the Siamese Boundary, where it joins with the Siamese line running to Haad Yai Junction, where a junction is made with the main Bangkok-Penang line.

Through working between the Federated Malay States and Kelantan via the Siamese State Railways commenced in 1921, and via the East Coast Railway in 1931.

Branch lines connect the main line with the ports on the West Coast at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson Wharf and Port Weld.

A causeway carrying two lines of rails and a roadway has been built across the Johore Strait, connecting the island of Singapore with the Peninsula.

The total length of line now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States Railway Administration is 1,067 miles.

The line is of metre gauge. On the mail trains on the West Coast main line there are sleeping saloons and restaurant cars, and on the East Coast Line sleeping saloons run from Tumpat to Singapore.
and vice versa on the Through Weekly Express.

The expenditure on the capital account (including lines not open for traffic), was $232,596,218 up to 31st December, 1931, all of which, with the exception of $48,720,897 from loan funds, has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States.

In addition $2,032,801 has been expended on Capital Improvements from the Railway Renewals and Betterment Fund.

Roads.

The mileage of metalled roads maintained by the Public Works Department is 2,840, of which approx. 1,700 miles have been treated with bituminous compound, and is made up as follows:

- Perak: 963 miles
- Selangor: 920 "
- Negri Sembilan: 513 "
- Pahang, including Fraser's Hill: 431 "
- Cameron Highlands: 13 "

Total: 2,840 miles

These roads connect up every township of importance throughout the whole of the Federated Malay States.

The total expenditure on the maintenance of metalled roads in 1931 amounted to $2,960,968 and the average cost of upkeep per mile was $1,043 compared with $1,241 in 1930.

In addition to metalled roads, 148 miles of unmetalled roads and 1,791 miles of bridle paths were maintained.

The policy of improving the alignment of main roads, treating their surfaces with bituminous material, setting back road side drains and replacing temporary by permanent bridges to enable them to cope with present-day traffic was continued.

The substantially improved condition of the roads brought about during the past few years by special treatment of the metalled surfaces and other improvements has already begun to yield definite results in making reduction of maintenance costs possible.

The cost of maintenance per mile has dropped from $1,483 per mile for 1928 to $1,043 per mile for 1931.

The gradient of the main roads seldom exceeds 1 in 30 and in two instances they lead over the mountain passes between Selangor and Pahang, known as "the Gap," 2,800 feet, and "Ginting Simpah," 2,000 feet. From the pass at "the Gap" the road climbs to the Federated Malay States Hill Station known as "Fraser's Hill," 4,280 feet.

The highest elevation so far reached by a main road is 4,850 at Tanah Sedia, in the Cameron Highlands, a new hill station now being developed.

Posts, Savings Bank, Telegraphs and Telephones.

A well organised system of Posts extends throughout the Federated Malay States by rail, motor car, cycle, runner, sea, and river. All towns and villages of any size have their regular deliveries and collections of mail matter and these facilities are being extended rapidly. The external mail services are frequent to all other ports of the world through Port Swettenham and through the Straits Settlements ports of Singapore and Penang. The postal services include Parcel Post, Cash on Delivery (or Value Payable Post); Insurance, Money Orders, British Postal Orders, all these services extend to a great many different countries. They are operated at 104 Post Offices by officers of the Posts and Telegraphs Department and at 70 other places by station-masters and others.

Savings Bank business is transacted at all Post Offices at all hours at which they are open, the Bank being controlled by the Department. The interest payable on deposits is 3 per cent.

Telegraph lines connect all the Post Offices and 43 of the "Postal Agencies" (i.e. offices operated by Station Masters and others) with a main trunk system throughout the Peninsula, and through Singapore and Penang with the rest of the world by submarine cable and by wireless. The Department has its own telegraph lines through the State of Johore connecting the Federated Malay States with Singapore. Local lines connect offices in Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu with offices in the Federated Malay States and there is a line connecting Betong in Siam with Kroh in the Federated Malay States.

The Telephone system extends throughout the Federated Malay States. There are at present 67 public exchanges maintaining a continuous night and day service and 30 other places at which Call Offices are maintained giving a service restricted to the hours during which the local Post Office is open for the transaction of public business. Of the Post Offices in the Federated Malay States, 97, therefore, are provided with public telephone facilities. Public Call Office facilities are also available at a number of Railway Stations. At most of the remaining places calls, including trunk calls, can in case of emergency be made from the local Police Stations.

All the exchanges are connected by means of trunk lines and trunk communication (which may also be obtained from Call Offices) is possible between all exchanges. In case of emergency trunk calls may be made from the local Police Stations when the Call Offices are closed.

The Federated Malay States telephone system is connected to the telephone system in Singapore, Malacca (and through Malacca with North Johore) and with the telephone system in Penang, Province Wellesley and Kedah.

There are 2,915 miles of telegraph and telephone lines in the Federated Malay States with an overhead wire mileage of 24,199 miles. In addition there are 210 miles of underground cables with a wire mileage of 16,093 miles. The Department also has 123 miles of telegraph line with a wire mileage of 857 miles in the State of Johore.

The details and figures furnished above are taken up to the 31st December, 1931.

Perak.

His Highness Paduka Sri Sultan Iskandar Shah, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., ibni al-Markhum al-Sultan Idris.

Perak is the most northerly of the Federated States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south having an area of 7,800 square miles. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress.

The State is well watered, the Perak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus, the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai), being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau, and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills and on Gunong Kledang, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 74,102 acres of land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation for rice. A similar scheme is in course of development in the Sungei Manik area in Lower Perak District.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang, and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is (a) 968½ of metalled and (b) 89 of unmetalled cart roads, 972 miles of bridle and other paths.

The British Resident has residencies at Taiping, the Headquarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Perak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Perak, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory which was taken over in 1909 and incorporated in the Upper Perak District, exceeds 1,000 square miles of area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legeh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasok on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

Selangor.

His Highness Al'adin Sulaiman Shah, G.C.M.G., ibni Al-Merham Raja Muda Musa, Sultan.

Selangor, situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Perak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca. Its coast line extends for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The state is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Perak and Selangor; the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The natives are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts, viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat, and Kuala Selangor, each under a District Officer.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 111,737 (1931 Census). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 114 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence.

There were 416 Schools in the State in 1931, including 44 English Schools, 87 Malay Schools, 159 Tamil Schools and 126 Chinese Schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River, and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels, exclusive of native craft, which called at the port in 1931 was 5,555,534.

The total Revenue of the State in 1931 was $20,329,658, and the expenditure $22,228,180. There is no public debt except such as is included in the public debt of the Federation.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land import duties are charged on spirituous liquors, wines, beers, petroleum, tobacco, matches and alum. In 1931 the gross total value of imports was $53,372,412 and the exports $42,089,402.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining, the amount of tin exported in 1931 was 247,076 pikuls valued at $14,726,694. The area alienated for mining is 51,043 acres. Coffee planting under European supervision, made good progress some years ago but has now been almost entirely abandoned. In 1931 there were 109,438 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. The rubber industry which has made great progress has met with a set back owing to the unprecedented fall in the price of rubber. At the end of 1931 the area under rubber cultivation was approximately 501,417 acres.
value of cultivated rubber exported during 1931 was $19,494,662.

The length of roads upkeep in 1931 was 1,048 miles as against 1,038 miles in 1930. The total number of miles remetalled during the year 1931 was 132 as against 171 in 1930. 100 miles of road were treated with bituminous materials. The average cost of maintenance of metalled and gravelled roads was $1,159 per mile.

Negri Sembilan (The Nine States).

His Highness Muhammad, O.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., ibni Almerhum Aniah, Yang Di-perdana Besar.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan lies on the Western side of the Peninsula and is bounded on the North-west by Selangor, on the North-east by Pahang, on the East by Johore, on the South by Malacca, and on the South-west by the sea.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungai Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District Officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Ulu Muar in Kuala Pilah, and at Tampin.

The value of imports amounted to $9,472,920 in 1931 and that of exports to $14,162,447. The revenue of the State, which in 1931 amounted to $7,974,546 is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1931, 8,665 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 647,244 acres for building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemenchek and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative. The Malay population is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the Settlement of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coconuts. During 1931 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:

- Rubber: 369,353 acres
- Rice: 32,626 acres
- Coconuts: 22,388 acres

Other cultivation covered:
- Oil palm: 928 acres
- Fruit trees: 2,061 acres

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

Educational facilities comprise 81 Malay Vernacular Schools, seven English Schools, and 36 Tamil Schools.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 607 miles of metalled roads of which 342 miles are tarred, together with 272 miles of bridlepaths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts.

Pahang.

His Highness al-Sultan Abu Bakar Ri'ayatu'd-Din Mu'adzam Shah, C.M.G., ibni al-Marhum al-Mu'tasim Ri'lah al-Sultan Abdul'lah, Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor, and Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembiling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming part of the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for houseboats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Bentong, Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast Line of the Federated Malay States Railways runs through Pahang and is now open for traffic as far as Tumpat, Kelantan.

There is a motor car service both ways from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Lipis, 119 miles; also from Jerantut Station on the Railway to Kuantan, a distance of 109 miles.

The total mileage of metalled roads in Pahang is 444 miles. A road from Batu Talam to Kuala Medang has been completed up to the 22nd mile post and it is hoped to link this road with Kuala Lipis, when funds are made available.

The total revenue of the State during 1931 amounted to $3,714,321 and the expenditure to $5,876,944.

There are 5 Government English Schools, 2 private English Schools, 80 Malay Boys' Schools, 5 Malay Girls' Schools, 12 Tamil Schools, 22 Chinese Schools, and 1 Javanese School in the State.
