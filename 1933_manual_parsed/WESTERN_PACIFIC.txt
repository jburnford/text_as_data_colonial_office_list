WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.
The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:—

The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
Tonga.
The New Hebrides.
The Phoenix Group.
Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.

The Colony, which includes Ocean, Christmas, Fanning, and Washington Islands, besides the Gilbert and Ellice groups, is under the charge of a Resident Commissioner, who is responsible to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific who resides in Fiji.

The Gilbert and Ellice Groups.—The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following sixteen islands:—Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Tarawa, Maiana, Kuria, Aranuka and Abemama (Northern Gilberts); Nonouti and Tabiteuea (Central Gilberts); Onotoa, Beru, Nukunau, Tamana and Arorae (Southern Gilberts).

The Ellice Islands are the following nine:—Namune, Nanumaga, Nui, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Naurakita.

The two groups consist of a series of coralatolls lying between 4° N. latitude and 10° S. and 170° to 180° E. longitude with an area of 180 square miles. The principal export is copra.

The population of the Gilbert Group on the 27th April, 1931, was 26,528. This figure was made up of 94 Europeans, 37 Chinese and
other Asiatics, 220 half-castes and "other population" and 26,177 natives.

There were in the Ellice Group at this date 4,074 persons, comprising 13 Europeans, 19 half-castes and "other population" and 4,042 natives.

With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate.

A revised code of native laws is validated by an Ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups.

Ocean Island (or Banaba), in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the Headquarters of the Government and the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. The population of Ocean Island on the 27th April, 1931, was 2,607. Of these 129 were Europeans. The natives numbered 1,780. Indentured labourers with their wives and families numbered 889. There were also 698 Chinese, all of whom are employed by the British Phosphate Commissioners.

Fanning and Washington Islands lie about 3° 51' N. latitude, and 159° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but labour is recruited from the Gilbert Islands for the copra industry. A District Officer is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean Station of the Pacific Cable Board, whose employees and their wives comprise practically the entire European population of 33. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the Colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel of the Fanning Island Company. The total population on the 30th June, 1930, was 268.

Christmas Island (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles South-East by East of Fanning Island. The area is about 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts. Under the terms of a License dated the 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut Plantations Limited of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell, and guano during the term of 87 years from the 1st January, 1914. The port of entry for Christmas Island is Fanning Island, so that all inward entries and outward clearances must be made at the latter port. Periodical visits are made by H.M.'s ships.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work has been undertaken of late years and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. Every Island has a native hospital under the charge of a native student trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

Communication between the various islands was formerly infrequent, depending on the irregular movements of vessels belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, Limited, On Chong and Company, and the British Phosphate Commissioners, but the acquisition by the Administration of the auxiliary sailing vessel "Nimance" has considerably increased the facilities for regular communication.

Revenue is obtained from a copra tax, trading and other licences, import and export duties, non-native capitulation tax, etc.

The Revenue and Expenditure of the Colony have been as follows:

| Year ended 30th June | Revenue | Expenditure |

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Ysabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ongtong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. According to the 1931 census figures the native population is 90,719. Malaita is the most densely populated, 39,356 (1931 census figures). The natives have been described as treacherous, but of late years have shown themselves amenable to law and civilisation. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped by legislation. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philip and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts amounts to 60,000 acres. The non-native population in 1931 numbered 497 Europeans and 193 Asiatics. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1883. The headquarters of the Protectorate is at Tulagi, a small island off Florida. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, Malaita, Gizo, San Cristoval, Guadalcanal, Ysabel and Santa Cruz. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

The Customs Tariff consists of duties at specific or ad valorem rates on certain imports and exports.

Percentage of Trade with the United Kingdom 10·553%
Percentage of Trade with other parts of the British Empire 67·260%
Percentage of Foreign Trade 22·187%
United States of America 13·768%
China 2·606%

TONGA.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, with an area of about 250 square miles, are situated between the 18th and 22nd degrees of south latitude. They were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most of the islands are of coral formation, but some are volcanic, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand and Samoa. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. There is monthly communication by steamer with Auckland. Passengers, goods, and mails from other countries tranship, as a rule, at Suva. During the dry season, i.e., from April to December, steamers call at regular intervals for copra freights.

Census of Population, April, 1931:

| Category     | Number |
|--------------|--------|
| Tongans      | 27,700 |
| Europeans    | 482    |
| Half-castes  | 265    |
| Others       | 392    |
| Total        | 28,839 |

In 1845 George Tubou I, who was the first to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, was proclaimed King. The present Ruler is assisted by a Parliament and a Privy Council. The Privy Council is composed of two European and six Native Ministers of the Crown who are also heads of the various government
departments. The civil service is composed mostly of Tongans, the European officials numbering about 43. The general tariff is 12½% ad valorem and there are no preferential duties.

Of the rest of the imports during 1931 the United Kingdom supplied 11 per cent, New Zealand 41 per cent, Australia 28 per cent and other British possessions 8 per cent.

The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are seven churches in Tonga, viz., the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, with about 17,000 adherents; the Free Church of Tonga, with about 4,600; the Church of Tonga, with about 2,000; the Roman Catholic Mission, with about 3,000; the Church of England, 180; the Church of Latter Day Saints, 630; and the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, with about 190 adherents.

The Wesleyan Mission was first founded in Tonga in the year 1826, and a few years later the chiefs and people embraced Christianity and became members of the Church. The control and management of the Mission in Tonga were entrusted about the year 1867 to the Australasian Conference and continued until the year 1883, when King George Tubou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded, with a large majority of his chiefs and people and, with the assistance of the Rev. Shirley Baker, established the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga as a separate and independent body though retaining the same doctrines, discipline, and form of worship as the Wesleyan Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaogos," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakago" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

In the year 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church, and an enquiry that was held into the state of the finances disclosed a very lax state of affairs. As a result of this enquiry it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies as a separate and independent Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. At a joint conference of the two churches held in April, 1924, union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. A. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued as a result of this division in respect of the ownership of the churches and property of the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga established by King George I in 1885. It was finally decided on appeal in favour of the united Church, of which the present Queen is the head.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufaahau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917 to Prince Uiliami Tugi, the present Premier, and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed on 18th May, 1900.

The present premier, Uliame Tugi, is the Prince Consort, and was formerly Minister for Lands. The progress of Tonga since 1905 has been satisfactory.

Every Tongan is entitled to an allotment of land for cultivation, so that no unemployment exists. Primary education for Tongans between the ages of 6 and 14 is compulsory. There are two boys' colleges at which provision is made for secondary education. Secondary education of girls is entirely in the hands of the Christian missions. Medical work is well organised; and, unlike most native communities in the Pacific, the native population steadily increases in number.

British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment exceeding two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga Courts. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.
of the High Commissioner. Licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British and Australian sterling.

Arrangements were made in 1919 for the issue of Tongan Government Treasury notes. At the end of 1931, 10s., 1/2, and 5/- notes were in circulation to the value of £21,000. The issue is secured by a coin and investment reserve.

There are no private banks in the Kingdom. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1926. At the end of 1931 there were 563 depositors and £26,459. in deposits.

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 sq. miles.

The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The Europeans are mostly British or French.

Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, Seventh Day Adventists and Church of Christ, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church.

The principal exports are copra, cocoa, cotton, coffee, trocas; maize, hides and various miscellaneous products are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914 to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 18th, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium Staff working in Departments under the joint control of the two Resident Commissioners.

The Customs Tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an ad valorem basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.

The import trade of the Group is mainly confined to Australia and France in roughly equal proportions, while the bulk of the exports are shipped to the latter country.

The Islands are of coral formation, and several of them are planted with coconuts. All except McKean and Enderbury Islands are leased to Messrs. Burns, Philp (South Sea) Company, Limited, for 87 years, from 1st January, 1914.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by
the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1806. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population numbers 200 persons.

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, A. H. Young.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.
