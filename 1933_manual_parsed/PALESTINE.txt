PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the States of Syria and the Lebanon, which are under French Mandate, on the west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian province of Sinai (the boundary running from a point west of Rafa on the Mediterranean to a point two miles to the west of where the thalweg of the Wadi Araba joins the Gulf of Aqaba) and on the east by Trans-Jordan, which is included in the area of the Palestine Mandate.

The boundary on the north was determined by the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December, 1920 (Cmd. 1185) and in pursuance of that Convention was delimited between the Mediterranean and El Hamme in 1922. The Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government giving effect to the delimitation is published as Cmd. 1910 (Treaty Series No. 13 (1923)).

The frontier runs from the Mediterranean at Ras al Nakura eastwards to Yarun, thence N.E. to the village of Qadis, thence N.N.E. to Metullah and across the Jordan Valley to Tel Al Qadi (in Palestine) and Banias (in Syria), thence S.S.W. to Jisr Banat Yakub, thence southwards along the Jordan to the Lake of Tiberias, thence along the eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias to a point almost due east of the town of Tiberias, thence S.S.E. to El Hamme Station on the Hejaz railway.

The frontier with Trans-Jordan is defined as a line drawn from a point two miles west of Aqaba on the Gulf of Aqaba up the centre of the Wadi Araba, the Dead Sea and the River Jordan to the junction of the latter with the River Yarmuk, thence up the centre of the River Yarmuk to the Syrian frontier.

The Natural Divisions of Palestine.

Palestine comprises four zones of country:—
(a) The hill country of Galilee and Judea,
(b) the five plains, including that lying in the rift of the Jordan Valley which, from the north of Lake Tiberias to the Dead Sea, is actually below the level of the Mediterranean,
(c) the Beersheba area, different in character and population from the rest of the country,
(d) the desert area.

The five plains are:—The Acre Plain, the Plain of Esdraelon, the Huleh Plain, the Coastal Plain and the Plain of the Jordan.

Geology.

Limestone is found in the hill country, where it forms the principal building stone. Sandstone abounds along the coast and was used by the Crusaders for their maritime forts and castles (Atlit and Acre); the new Haifa breakwater has been constructed of sandstone from Atlit. Of metallic minerals, copper ores and important deposits of manganese occur in the southern part of Palestine near the Gulf of Akaba. Petroleum and bitumen exudations are found around the southern part of the Dead Sea, and this region is now being explored. Of non-metallic ores, rock phosphate and bituminous limestone occur in large deposits on the slopes of the Judean Wilderness. Rock salt occurs in unlimited quantity in the salt dome of Jebel Usdum and has been used for the supply of the Jerusalem market. A sulphur deposit of commercial importance has been located south of Gaza. A good quality of gypsum is found at Menahemiya near Tiberias and impure varieties are found on the slopes of the Judean wildernesses and underlie the alluvium of certain sections of the coastal plain. Palestine Potash, Limited, produces potassium chloride and bromine under the Dead Sea Concession, the former being exported to the eastern market and the latter to England.

There are hot springs of medicinal value at Tiberias and El Hamme where baths have been established.

Climate.

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude: the coastal region is sub-tropical and humid; the elevated, hilly zone is drier and more temperate, while the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight. The summer months are almost rainless. January and February are, in general, the wettest months and the main rainfall occurs between November and April. The rainfall varies largely, from a minimum of 24 inches in the south to a maximum of 31 inches in the north.

Water for domestic use is obtained in the larger towns from piped supplies: in the smaller towns and rural districts, from rock cisterns in which rain water is collected or from small springs or wells.

Jerusalem has a piped water supply, pumped partly from a spring about 10 miles south of the town by an installation made by the Military Authorities soon after the occupation, partly from Solomon's Pools, near Bethlehem, by an installation made by the Civil Administration, and partly from the springs of Ain Fara, Ain Fawwar and Wadi el Qilt by works constructed for the Municipality in 1926, 1931 and 1932.

Considerable progress has been made towards the eradication of malaria, formerly so prevalent, by Government distribution of quinine in villages, oiling of wells and cisterns, provision of pumps, and drainage of swamps. The Government has been assisted in anti-malarial work by research and survey units attached to the Department of Health, by the Joint Distribution Committee of America and the Rockefeller Institute.

The country is relatively free from epidemic disease.

Government.

Under Turkish rule, part of Palestine was in the Vilayet (Province) of Beirut and part in the Sandjak (District) of Jerusalem. After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British forces, the country remained under British Military Administration until July, 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a Civil Administration set up.

By the Treaty of Peace, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey renounced all rights over Palestine. The Principal Allied Powers had selected His Britannic Majesty as Mandatory at the Conference at San Remo, on 25th April, 1920. The terms of the Mandate were approved by the Council of the League of Nations on the 24th July, 1922, and the Mandate came into force on September 29th, 1923. The Mandatory is responsible inter alia for carrying into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd, 1917, viz.:—"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will
Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into three districts—the Jerusalem, Northern and Southern Districts—each administered by a District Commissioner.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is nearly 10,000 square miles in extent. The population of this territory taken by census on

The Arab public system of education, embraced in 1931-1932 by Government, embraced in 1931-32 with 24,837 scholars, the great majority of whom were Moslems. These schools included 2 Teacher Training Colleges with 78 men and 63 women students, and 10 schools with secondary classes containing 2,400 pupils.

use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

On the 1st September, 1922, a Constitution was promulgated.

Under this Constitution Palestine is governed by a High Commissioner, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, assisted by an Executive Council consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Treasurer; and by an Advisory Council consisting of heads of certain Departments.

An attempt was made in 1923 to create the Legislative Council provided for in the Constitution, but owing to the refusal of the Arabs to take part in the elections, it was replaced by the Advisory Council in order to secure the enactment of legislation until such time as a Legislative Council is created.

English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

In 1921 a Supreme Moslem Council was constituted in order to control and manage Moslem waqf and Sharia Courts in Palestine. It consists of a President known also as Rais-Al-Ulema and four members elected by secondary electors, who again are elected by all male Palestinian Moslems over 20 years of age. The Council nominates for approval by Government the officers of the Sharia Courts and appoints the waqf officers.

The Council has established a Moslem Orphanage in Jerusalem, and has carried out important repairs of sacred buildings and extensive tree planting on Waqf land and in Moslem cemeteries.

Regulations were made under the Religious Communities Ordinance, 1926, by the High Commissioner in 1927 for the organisation of the Jewish community in Palestine. The Jewish community, like the Moslem and the various Christian communities, enjoys autonomy in the administration of its internal affairs, religious, cultural and communal; it has also power to levy rates on its members. The organs of the community are a Chief Rabbiinate and local Rabbinical officers, an Elected Assembly, a General Council which is elected by the Assembly and represents the community in its dealings with the Government, and local communities.

Complete freedom in their communal affairs is allowed to those Jewish congregations who have exercised the option to remain outside the recognised community.

The Jewish Agency is recognized as the representative body of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish National Home; it is represented in Palestine by an Executive whose headquarters are at Jerusalem.

The Palestine Government has maintained in force the status and privileges accorded to the different Christian Communities under the Ottoman regime.

The affairs of the larger towns are administered by Municipal Councils presided over by Mayors. In smaller towns and large villages Local Councils have been set up.

A Central Town Planning Commission supervises the activities of local town planning commissions with the object of securing the proper development of urban areas.

Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into three districts—the Jerusalem, Northern and Southern Districts—each administered by a District Commissioner.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is nearly 10,000 square miles in extent. The population of this territory taken by census on November 18th, 1931, was 1,035,821, of which number 387,525 were living in 23 towns and large villages. There are 759,712 Moslems, 174,610 Jews, 91,607 Christians. The remaining 10,101 include Druzes, Samaritans and Bahais, and persons of no confession.

The chief town, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1617, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917. Its population in 1931 was 90,503. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large numbers of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The site of Solomon's Temple is occupied by the Dome of the Rock, which contains a relic of Muhammad and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham. Bethlehem, the scene of Christ's Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity, at the east end of the present village, is said to be the oldest Christian church in existence.

The population figures for the other principal towns are:—Jaffa, 51,866; Tel Aviv, 46,101; Haifa, 50,403; Gaza, 17,046; Nazareth, 8,758; Nablus, 17,189; Safad, 9,441; Tiberias, 8,801; Hebron, 17,631; Ramle, 10,347; Bethlehem, 6,814; Lydda, 11,250; Acre, 7,897.

Jewish Colonisation.

The total Jewish population of Palestine is 174,610. Jewish agricultural settlements number 125 and have a population of over 46,000. Forty-one of them are built on the land of the Jewish National Fund, established by the Zionist Organisation for the purpose of acquiring land to remain the property of the Jewish people. (The total possessions of the Jewish National Fund now amount to 288,000 metric dunams.) These settlements have been equipped and financed by the Keren Hayesod, the Colonisation Fund of the Jewish Agency.

Extensive colonisation work has been performed by the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association, which took over colonies established by Baron Edmond de Rothschild and established new settlements, the total being about 30.

A number of settlements have been founded on the land acquired by the American Zion Commonwealth and on tracts purchased by private individuals. The total area in Jewish possession is now over 1,100,000 metric dunams, of which 80,000 are planted with oranges.

The Jewish urban population is 132,000, its main centres being:—Jerusalem and suburbs 58,850, Tel Aviv (a purely Jewish city) 46,101, Haifa 16,000, and Jaffa 7,700. There are about 2,800 Jewish industrial enterprises employing 11,000 workers and representing a total of capital investment of £P.2,500,000 with a total annual output value of the same figure.

The local affairs of the smaller Jewish settlements are controlled by Vaada or Councils elected by the male and female residents who own registered holdings or pay taxes.

Education.

The approximate number of children in Palestine between the ages of 3 and 18 years is 307,000, of whom 231,000 are Moslems, 49,000 Jews and 27,000 Christians. The number of children who attended school in 1930-31 was 82,214, including 30,535 Moslems, 34,154 Jews, 16,966 Christians and 559 Druzes and Bahais.

The Arab public system of education, maintained by Government, embraced in 1931-32 305 schools, with 24,837 scholars, the great majority of whom were Moslems. These schools included 2 Teachers' Training Colleges with 78 men and 63 women students and 10 schools with secondary classes containing 248
secondary pupils. There is an agricultural school at Tulkarm which, in 1931-32, had 40 boarders. This school also provides agricultural training for teachers in rural schools. Technical education is provided in most of the larger schools. There is a Law School in Jerusalem with 89 students.

The Jewish and Christian Communities provide, the former almost entirely and the latter to a very large extent, for the education of their own children.

The Jewish public system, controlled by the Jewish Agency, embraced in 1931-32, 256 schools with 22,430 pupils. In 1931-31 there were four Teachers' Training Colleges, with 165 men and 209 women students, and 13 schools with 43 secondary classes containing 1,311 secondary pupils. In that year there existed also 5 Agricultural Schools with 610 students; Junior Technical Schools with 199 students and a Senior Technical College at Haifa with 88 students. The Hebrew University which was established in Jerusalem in 1925 had, in the year 1930-31, 150 students and 54 "auditors." The number of Jewish private schools was 117 with 11,657 pupils.

The Palestine Board of Higher Studies was established in 1924. On it the Government and many educational institutions are represented. It conducts the Palestine Matriculation Examination and the Palestine Diploma Examination, both of which are public examinations recognised by Government. The Palestine Matriculation Examination is recognised by many British Universities.

The Christian schools maintained by various foreign and religious bodies numbered in 1930-31, 181, with 17,060 pupils on their rolls; 32 schools had secondary classes, with 1,032 pupils.

There were, in 1930-31, 31 private Moslem schools with 3,427 boys and 923 girls maintained by local communities and associations. Two of these schools had also secondary classes. There were then also 106 Kuttabs, 26 in towns and 80 in villages. These provided for 2,969 children of whom 184 were girls.

Most non-Government schools receive a capitation grant-in-aid from the Department of Education, conditional on the acceptance of a certain measure of Government supervision and inspection. A block grant of £P.20,000 a year is made to the Jewish Agency for its schools.

Justice.

The Courts in Palestine are either civil or religious courts. The former have jurisdiction over local subjects in all matters save those of personal status and Waqfs (charitable endowments), and over foreign subjects in all matters, subject to the provisions mentioned below.

There is a Magistrate's Court in every sub-district, and, in the larger towns, such as Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, two or more such courts. The Magistrates are for the most part Palestinian and have jurisdiction in first instance in minor criminal cases for which the punishment is not more than one year's imprisonment or a fine of a hundred pounds or both, such imprisonment and fine and in civil cases where the value of the subject-matter does not exceed £P.100. They also have jurisdiction in actions for the recovery of the possession of land.

There are four District Courts, each composed of a British President and two Palestinian judges. They serve respectively the sub-districts of Jerusalem, Hebron and Beersheba, Jaffa and Gaza, Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem and Nazareth, and Haifa, Acre, Tiberias and Safad. They go on circuit within the area of their jurisdiction. A District Court has jurisdiction in first instance over all crimes except those punishable with death and in all civil cases outside the jurisdiction of a Magistrate. It also hears appeals from the decisions of Magistrates both in civil and in criminal cases, except in cases for the recovery of the possession of land. Crimes punishable with death are tried by a Court of Criminal Assize composed of the Chief Justice or Senior Palestinian Judge of the Supreme Court sitting with the District Court.

In each district, in addition to the District Court, there is a Land Court, composed of the President of the District Court and a Palestinian judge of that court, which hears all cases in which the ownership of land is in issue.

The highest court in Palestine is the Supreme Court which is composed of a British Chief Justice and one other British judge and four Palestinian judges. The court sits in two capacities:

(1) As a Court of Appeal, in which capacity it has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters decided in first instance by the District Courts, the Land Courts and the Court of Criminal Assize;

(2) As a High Court of Justice, in which capacity it hears applications of the nature of habeas corpus and mandamus proceedings.

Each division of the Court of Appeal is composed normally of three judges, while the High Court may sit with two judges. In either case a British judge presides. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court in civil cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council where the value of the suit exceeds £500.

The Chief Justice of Palestine is ex officio President of the Full Court of Appeal of Egypt.

Special arrangements exist in the Beersheba sub-district, where minor cases are disposed of according to tribal custom by the Court of Sheikhs. The District Court of Jerusalem visits Beersheba every month to hear appeals from the local courts and to try more serious criminal cases.

All matters of personal status affecting Moslems are within the jurisdiction of the Sharia Courts. A Sharia Court consists of a Kadi, and appeals from his decision lie to the Moslem Court of Appeal, which is composed of a President and two members.

Jewish Religious Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters of personal status of Jews, and jurisdiction by consent in other matters. An appeal from the decision of the Jewish Religious Courts lies to the Rabbinical Council.

The different Christian communities (such as the Latin and Orthodox) have similar jurisdiction to that of the Jewish Courts.

Special provisions exist with regard to the trial of foreigners. The general effect of these rules is that where a foreign subject is charged with an offence other than a petty offence, he may claim to be tried by a British magistrate or by a court containing a majority of British judges. In the Court of Appeal he can claim a majority of British judges and in matters of personal status that the action be heard by the British President.

Security.

The Police Establishment in December, 1931, was 184 officers (including 68 British officers) and 2,355 other ranks (including 650 British Non-Commissioned officers and constables). 1,187 heinous crimes were reported in 1931 (1,172 in 1930) and six death sentences were carried out.

There are Central Prisons in Jerusalem and Acre for long term prisoners and a Female Prison in Bethlehem. There are also two Jail Labour Companies of approximately 350 each, the prisoners in which are employed on public works.

The garrison in Palestine and Trans-Jordan in 1932 consisted of the following units:—
Air Headquarters Palestine and Trans-Jordan (Jerusalem), which administers the following Army and Royal Air Force units:

Army—
Two Battalions of Infantry, one stationed at Jerusalem and one at Haifa.

Royal Air Force—
One Squadron (Day Bomber) Aircraft.
One Flight (General Purpose) Aircraft.
(The remaining two flights of the General Purpose Squadron, which form part of the garrison of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, are stationed in Egypt.)
One Company Armoured Cars (4 Sections)

Trans-Jordan Frontier Force—
Three Squadrons of Horse, a Camel Company, a Mechanised Company, and 4 Troops of Reservists.

Agriculture and Forestry.

Modern methods are making headway and hold out hopes of development and progress. The country is generally fertile, and cereals, wine, oranges, grapefruit and lemons, olives and various fruits are produced, while sheep and goats thrive in the lowlands and in the mountains.

For the most part the crops are raised without irrigation, except where springs exist and in the eastern portion of the Plain of Esdraelon.

There are generally two crops harvested each year—the cereal and leguminous crop in May to June and a summer crop in August and September.

The yields of the main crops in 1930 to 1932 were:

|       | 1930 Metric tons | 1931 Metric tons | 1932 Metric tons |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Wheat | 87,339          | 79,650          | 53,100          |
| Barley| 60,071          | 41,200          | 27,500          |
| Durra | 37,058          | 16,862          | 10,100          |
| Lentils| 3,800         | 3,758           | 2,500           |
| Olives| 2,993           | 33,906          | 5,100           |
| Citrus Fruits (Exports) | 2,897,694 | 2,468,937 | 3,734,556 |

In 1930 there were in Palestine:
- Horses: 13,825
- Mules: 5,304
- Donkeys: 76,558
- Camels: 25,341
- Cattle: 146,997
- Sheep: 252,773
- Goats: 440,132
- Poultry: 1,161,576

Thirteen Government forest nurseries were maintained during 1931 and produced approximately 1½ millions of forest plants. Planting, begun in 1920, is being considerably extended. By the end of 1931 Government had planted 3,400 acres. Special attention is being given to the reclamation of sand dunes.

Nearly 170,000 acres of state forests have been reserved.

Government Agricultural and Horticultural Experiment Stations have been organised at Acre, Beisan, Jerusalem, Jericho, Farradich (near Safed) and Majdal (near Gaza). The Acre Station also includes a Stud Farm.

Industry and Trade.

The principal industries of export importance are those of soap-boiling in Nablus, Jaffa and Haifa; wine-making, especially in the Jewish Colonies, Zikhron-Ya'acov, Rishon-le-Tivon and Petah-Tikva; olive oil in Nablus, Acre, Haifa and the district round Jaffa. Cement, textile goods and a variety of other articles are exported to Syria and other neighbouring countries. Durrah, lentils, sesame and edible oils are also exported in considerable quantities.

Oranges, grown chiefly in the Jaffa District, are exported to the United Kingdom and Europe, exports in 1931 being valued at £P.904,310. The area under citrus cultivation continues to increase.

Melons are exported mainly to Egypt and Syria.

The principal imports are rice, flour, sugar, petroleum products, textiles, building materials, automobiles, industrial machinery.

There is a considerable number of small factories and workshops, including flour mills, soap, brick and tile, knitted goods, textile, artificial teeth, iron and wood furniture, matches, oil mills and distilleries. Of the larger industries, a cement factory produces over 60,000 tons annually, 12 tobacco and cigarette factories produce some 25,000 kilos of cut tobacco, 494,000 kilos of cigarettes, 96,000 kilos of tobacco and 5,000 kilos of snuff, and an oil factory produces over 10,000 tons of refined oil.

The Hydro-electric Power Station of the Palestine Electric Corporation at Jisr Mejamieh now supplies current for light and power to Haifa, Tiberias, Jaffa and many rural centres. The Jerusalem Electric and Public Service Corporation serves Jerusalem and its environs, including Bethlehem.

Customs.

The Customs Tariff, which is non-differential, is fixed partly on a specific and partly on an ad valorem basis: 60% of imports pay specific charges, principally petrol, kerosene, sugar, rice, coffee, wheat flour, leaf tobacco, cigarettes, wood and timber for building, rubber tyres and tubes, boots and shoes. Ad valorem duties are levied on silk (20%), woollen (12%), goods and motor-cars (25%).

The revenue from import duties in 1931 was £P.921,945.

16.81% of imports came from the United Kingdom, 2.67% from other parts of the British Empire, 17.26% from Egypt, 17.12% from Syria and 10.74% from Germany.

Exports to the United Kingdom constituted 45.05% of the total in 1931, to other parts of the British Empire 2.61%, to Egypt 11.32%, to Syria 14.16%, and to Germany 12.83%.

Shipping and Communications.

The chief ports of Palestine are Haifa and Jaffa. The new harbour at Haifa will be completed in 1933. Acre and Gaza are also ports of entry, but their trade is small and is carried out mainly by sailing vessels.

The following are the principal shipping lines which call at Haifa and Jaffa:
- Lloyd Triestino, Servizi Maritimi, Messageries Maritimes, Fabre, Prince, Moss, American Export, Deutsche Levante. Tourist steamers of various lines call at Haifa during February, March and April.

In 1931 806 steamers, totalling 1,809,929 tons, and 2,143 sailing vessels, totalling 49,850 tons, called at Palestine ports.

Palestine possesses no shipping of its own, other than small sailing vessels and power launches.

Postal despatches are exchanged daily (in some cases twice daily) between all principal towns. There is also a daily exchange of despatches with Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan. Direct mails for Great Britain are despatched thrice weekly.

In 1931 there were conveyed 10,787,750 letters, 819,558 postcards, 5,838,902 printed communications and samples, 147,048 parcels. 236,350 telegrams were transmitted.
Imperial Airways have aerodromes at Gaza and Samakh (near Tiberias) and a flying boat station at Tiberias. The two latter are used in connection with the weekly air mail service to and from Great Britain, Iraq, Persia, and India. There is also a weekly air mail service from Ramle to Baghdad.

There is an Overland Mail Service (letters and parcels) with Iraq, via Amman.

All the principal towns are connected by telegraph and telephone. There is direct telegraph communication with Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan, and a trunk telephone service with Egypt and Trans-Jordan. Total length of main telegraph and telephone lines, 13,229 kilometres; local lines, 14,557 kilometres. Number of telephone subscribers 2,997; telephone instruments in use, 4,602.

The total length of the Palestine railways is approximately 721½ miles, including branch lines and sidings, sub-divided into the following sections:

| Standard Gauge (4' 8½") | Narrow Gauge (3' 6") | Hejaz Railway |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Kantara–Haifa            | Haifa–Samakh         |              |
| Lydd Section, Jaffa–Jerusalem | Nassib South–Ma'an |              |
| Safed–Sarafand           | Acre Junction–Acre   |              |
| Kafr Jenin–Beit Nabala Quarry Siding | Afule–Nablus–Tulkarem |              |

The Kantara–Rafa Section, known as the "Sinai Military Railway" (127 miles) is operated by the Palestine Railways on behalf of the Air Ministry.

There is through communication with Egypt, and trains connect at Kantara West daily with Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez and other parts of Egypt, goods vehicles being sent across the canal by means of a truck transporter. Sentinel-Cammell steam rail cars are in use on the Haifa–Gaza–Jaffa, Haifa–Acre and Haifa–Samakh sections.

East of Haifa the Palestine Railways system terminates at Samakh, and the section Samakh–Deraa (junction of the Hejaz Railway to Medina) is operated by the Hejaz Railway, which in turn is controlled by the French Government.

There are 573 miles of metalled roads in Palestine open for traffic throughout the year which are extensively used by motor transport, and in addition, many hundreds of miles of tracks passable for wheeled traffic of all kinds during dry weather.

Banking, Co-operatives and Currency.

The most important Bank in Palestine is Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Nazareth, Acre and Nablus. The Anglo-Palestine Bank has its head office in Jerusalem, with branches in Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Tiberias and Safad. In addition, there are branches in Jerusalem of the Ottoman Bank (also in Haifa, Jaffa, Nablus and Amman, and sub-offices at Bethlehem and Ramallah), and the Banco di Roma (also in Jaffa and Haifa). There is a Workers' Bank at Jaffa, and banks have been established for granting building loans to co-operative societies.

The co-operative movement is extensively established among the Jewish population, both urban and rural. A Registrar of Co-operative Societies has recently been appointed, whose principal task it will be to encourage and facilitate the growth of a similar movement among Arab farmers.

A Currency Board was appointed in London in 1926 in order to introduce and control a Palestine currency based on the pound sterling; and the new currency was issued on the 1st November, 1927, under the authority of an Order of His Majesty in Council dated the 7th of February, 1927.

The standard of currency is the Palestine pound, divided into 1,000 mils. The Palestine Currency Order provides for a gold coin of one Palestine pound containing 123.27447 grains of standard gold (the equivalent of the English sovereign). It is not intended at present to introduce gold coins. The Currency Board has issued silver coins of 100 and 50 mils, nickel bronze coins of 20, 10 and 5 mils, bronze coins of 2 and 1 mils, and currency notes of £P.100, £P.50, £P.10, £P.5, £P.1 and 500 mils.

The currency notes are legal tender for the amounts expressed therein.

Antiquities.

The Administration of the Antiquities Service in Palestine is controlled by the Department of Antiquities, working under the Antiquities Ordinance (1929) and Regulations (1930-32). During 1931, eighteen licences to excavate or make soundings were issued. The results of the Department's research work, together with summaries of the results of licensed excavations conducted by non-Government bodies, are published in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. (Published by Mr. Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, London, E.C.4.)

The Palestine Archaeological Museum, built with funds made available by Mr. John D. Rockefeller, junior, is in course of construction.

For further information on all the above subjects see the "Handbook of Palestine" (Luke, H.C., and Keith-Roach, E.), published in 1930 by Macmillan and Co., and issued under the authority of the Government of Palestine, the annual Blue Books of the Palestine Government, obtainable from the Superintendent of Printing and Stationery, Jerusalem, and the Annual Reports on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, published by His Majesty's Stationery Office.
