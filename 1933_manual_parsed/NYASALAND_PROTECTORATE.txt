NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.†

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruco (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shiré Highlands and Mlanje.

It is bounded on the north by Tanganyika Territory, on the west by Northern Rhodesia, on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and according to the most recent survey has a total area of about 47,949 square miles (land, 37,596).

It is divided into two Provinces, each under the control of a Provincial Commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into twenty districts, each in charge of a district commissioner, who is also a district magistrate.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 700 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

Population (Census, 1931).

Europeans, 1,975; Asiatics, 1,591; Natives, 1,599,888.

History.

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (later Sir H. H. Johnston, G.C.M.G., K.C.B.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yoes round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shire districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wabanga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (later Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyassa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shire and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yoes at the south end of Nyassa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonge of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. In 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

Constitution.

The administration of the Protectorate, control of which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa.

For the East African Governor's Conference, see under Kenya, page 330.

Climate and Products.

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shire Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shire Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 36 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shire Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

Industry and Customs.

The chief products of the Protectorate are tobacco, cotton, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat, and fibre.

The export of cotton for the year ended 31st December, 1931, was 2,263,728 lbs.; of tobacco 10,690,581 lbs. 97·29 per cent. of the export trade in 1931 was to the United Kingdom and British Colonies.

The chief imports are provisions, cotton goods, motor vehicles, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition. 60·4 per cent. of the imports in 1931 came from the United Kingdom and British Colonies.

The Customs revenue is derived principally from an import duty of 17½% on the cost at the seaport of discharge, i.e., Beira. No export duties are levied.

Nyasaland being wholly within the regions covered by the Congo Basin Treaties, 1885, and the Convention of St. Germain-en-Laye, 1919, may not grant preferential rates of duty. Its Customs Tariff, therefore, applies equally to imports from all nations.

Customs revenue collected during 1931 amounted to £26,427. as against £48,531 in the previous year.
The following table shows the origin of direct consignments of domestic trade imports during the last five years:

| Year | United Kingdom | British Possessions | Foreign Countries |
|------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
|      | £              | %                   | £                |
| 1927 | 4,065         | 45.78               | 211,065          |
| 1928 | 343,33        | 39.49               | 175,557          |
| 1929 | 269,703       | 36.28               | 165,006          |
| 1930 | 269,957       | 34.79               | 147,842          |
| 1931 | 302,534       | 41.63               | 136,682          |

The total exports of the Protectorate during 1931 weighed 9,867 tons and were valued at £537,887. Of the domestic products exported 84.04 per cent. of the weight and 98.51 percent. of the value were consigned to the United Kingdom.

Means of Communication.

A railway from Port Herald, on the Lower Shiré, to Blantyre, 113 miles, via Chirumo and Luchenza, was built by the Shird Highlands Railway Company, under an agreement made in 1902 with the Nyasaland Government under which a subsidy was paid to the Railway. Subsequently the Central African Railway Co. constructed a section, opened in 1915, from Chindio on the Zambezi to Port Herald, 61 miles, of which the first 45 are in Portuguese territory. Both lines are of 3ft. 6in. gauge. A railway of the same gauge was opened for traffic in April, 1922, by the Trans-Zambesia Railway Co., which runs from Murraça on the south bank of the Zambesi to Dondo, the junction with the Mashonaland trunk line, about 20 miles from Beira (165 miles, all in Portuguese territory). A bridge across the Zambezi to connect the Trans-Zambesia Railway with the Central Africa Railway is now under construction, as is also an extension of the railway system from Blantyre to Lake Nyasa. There are eight British steamers plying on the Zambezi and Shiré between Chinde and the railway terminus. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being 2,666. There are five steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Mails to and from England, are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

Telegraphs.

In 1925 the Government purchased the assets of the African Trans-continental Telegraph Company. The line is in use from Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika southwards through the Protectorate, via Blantyre and Tete, to Umtali in Southern Rhodesia and thence to Cape Town and England. The total mileage through the Protectorate is 787 miles. Telegrams may also be transmitted over the railway line and the Portuguese line between Chinde and Tete. Since Government assumed control of the telegraph service extensions have been constructed in the Central Province providing 140 additional miles of line. The telephone service now links up Zomba, Blantyre, Limbe, Cholo, and Luchenza.

Education.

An educational policy has been prepared by the Director of Education. Provision is made for the education of European children; native education in the hands of the missionary societies is controlled by the Government.

A grant of £7,616. was made by the Government in 1930.

Currency and Banking.

By a Proclamation of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling.

Banking operations in the Protectorate are governed by "The Banking Ordinance, 1902."

Two Banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited, and Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas); the former has a branch at Zomba, and agencies at other centres.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank.
