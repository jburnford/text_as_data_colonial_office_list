BASUTOLAND.

Situation and Description.

Basutoland forms an irregular oval within the Union of South Africa; the main axis, about 150 miles in length, lying in a north-easterly direction. The Orange Free State Province, Natal and the Cape Province form its boundaries. Its area is 11,716 square miles, or nearly as large as Belgium. It lies between 29° and 30° degrees south lat., and between 27° and 28° degrees east long.

A portion of the great Drakensberg range of mountains forms the eastern boundary of Basutoland. Peaks in this range rise to heights of eleven and twelve thousand feet. Westward the country is occupied by the Maluti, mountains inferior in height to the Drakensberg. They form a jumbled mass so closely packed that the valleys are of the narrowest, and there is little ground which can be cultivated. It is only along the Western border that mountains give place to hills and the cultivation of larger portions of land becomes possible.

In favourable seasons the territory produces large crops of wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. It also produces large numbers of cattle, horses, and sheep. The range of temperature is approximately from a maximum of 93° F. to a minimum of 11° F. The average rainfall is 30 inches.

The climate is good for Europeans and natives alike. Its high altitude and pure atmosphere prove most invigorating. Phthisis pulmonalis is little known except among Europeans who have come to the country on account of their disease. The latter in early stages of the disease improve at once. Persons suffering from malarial fever or its results are benefited greatly by a short residence in Basutoland. Leprosy imported from the Orange River Colony and Cape Colony has now a firm hold in the country, the proportion being about 91 per 1,000. As yet it has been possible to do little to check the spread of the disease. With the authority of the High Commissioner, a Leper Settlement was formed in 1912, about 4 miles from Maseru for the segregation and care of all lepers within the Territory.

Population and Industry.

In 1875 when Basutoland formed part of the Cape Colony, at the general census of the Colony taken in that year, the European population of Basutoland was 499, and the native 127,707.

The following are the census figures for 1921:

| Natives | ... | ... | 495,937 |
| Whites  | ... | ... | 1,603 |
| Indians | ... | ... | 172 |
| Mixed and Coloured | ... | ... | 1,069 |

Total | ... | ... | 498,781 |

Maseru, the capital, and largest town, has a population of 1,890 natives and 400 Europeans.

The productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron, and coal has been found and used in some parts by natives in small quantities.

History.

The Basutos appear to have been composed of the remnants of several tribes which were broken up in the wars waged by Mosilikatze, the king of the Matabele, in the early years of the last century. These remnants were united in about 1818 under Moseshi, a chief of great ability, who ruled for many years.

In 1852 war broke out between Moseshi and the British Government; the Basutos were defeated by Sir G. Cathcart at the battle of the Berea Mountain, and Moseshi sent in his submission, and made peace.
A few years later, in 1856, disputes arose between Mosesh and the Orange Free State respecting boundary questions, and hostilities resulted which lasted from 1856 to 1858, with indecisive results, and were concluded by the Treaty of Aliwal, 1858, but collisions frequently recurred.

In 1865 the war broke out afresh, and Mosesh again claimed the protection of the Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse. He declined to interpose actively, but despatched a British Commissioner to Thaba Bosigo, the capital of Basutoland, to settle the difficulties. This measure met with little success, and in the end the Boers were successful, and Mosesh sued for peace. At the treaty of Thaba Bosigo, April, 1866, he recognised the permanent cession of a portion of his district and acknowledged himself a subject of the Orange Free State.

The peace was of short duration, the war was renewed, and the Basutos, pressed by the Boers, were on the brink of destruction, when they again appealed to be taken under the authority of the Queen, and in January, 1868, Sir Philip Wodehouse received authority to recognise Mosesh and his tribe as British subjects, and for the incorporation of their territory. This was carried into effect by a proclamation dated March 12th, 1868.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition, until it was annexed to the Cape, by an Act of the Cape Legislature, No. 12 of 1871. The Act expressly declared that Basutoland was not to be subject to the general law of the Colony, and gave the Governor power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend to it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein.

The subsequent history of Basutoland was one of much trouble and disturbance.

In March, 1879, Moirosi, the chief of the Quithing district, in the south-east of Basutoland, rescued from justice his son Doda, who had been arrested for horse-stealing; and, on the Colonial authorities demanding his surrender, broke out into open defiance of its authority. Owing to the great natural strength of his country and stronghold, considerable difficulty was experienced in subduing him; but in December of that year his stronghold was carried by storm, and he himself fell in the assault. The proposals of the Colonial Government to divide the territory occupied by the adherents of this chief into lots for occupation by European settlers gave rise to great discontent among the Basutos who had remained loyal. This discontent was further increased by the extension of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, providing for a general disarmament, to Basutoland by proclamation in April, 1880, and culminated in the revolt of almost the whole tribe when an attempt was made to put the Act in force. The rebellion spread to the native territories east and south of Basutoland, East Griqualand, Tambookieland, and the Pandomisi, where the rising was signalled by the treacherous murder of Mr. Hope, the magistrate, and other Europeans.

Strenuous efforts were made by the Colony to reduce the Basutos to submission by force of arms, but without decisive success, though the loss of their cattle, and the interruption of cultivation, caused great distress amongst them. Early in 1881 overtures for an arrangement were made by the leading chiefs, and, at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, the High Commissioner acted as arbiter between the Colonial Government and the Basutos.

The terms of his award were, the registration of arms, the payment of compensation to those natives who had remained loyal by the tribe, and also the payment of a fine of 5,000 head of cattle. The award was accepted by the Basutos and the fine paid, but little was done towards fulfilling the other conditions. The Colonial Ministry, with a view to facilitate a settlement, cancelled the award and induced the Cape Parliament to assume the burden of compensating the loyalists. The Disarmament Proclamation was also repealed, and at a Pitso held on the 24th of April, 1883, a very liberal constitution was offered to the Basutos. Masupha, however, the chief of the Berea district, with several other chiefs of influence, held aloof, and practically declared their intention to have no further connection with the Colonial Government, and the tribe generally were understood to wish to be under the direct authority of the Imperial Government. In the meantime a strong feeling in favour of the entire abandonment of Basutoland had grown up in the Colony, and on the request of the Colonial Ministry the Imperial Government decided to undertake for a time the administration of the country on condition that satisfactory evidence was given by the Basutos of their desire to remain under the British Crown, that the Orange Free State should undertake to cause the frontier to be respected by its subjects, and that the Colony should pay over towards the cost of administration the Customs duties received on goods imported into Basutoland. This offer was accepted by the Colony, and provision was made in the Basutoland Disannexation Act of 1883 for the payment of £20,000 a year, and the Free State also intimated its willingness to comply with the conditions so far as it was concerned.

A great national Pitso of the Basutos was held on the 29th of November, 1883, attended by the representatives of more than two-thirds of the whole tribe, who unanimously expressed their willingness to comply with the conditions on which the Imperial Government was prepared to assume the responsibility of the administration of the country. Several important chiefs who were not at the Pitso subsequently expressed their concurrence in this resolution, Masupha alone refusing to accept the offers of the Government, and desiring to remain independent. Her Majesty's Government upon this decided that their conditions were sufficiently complied with, advised the Queen to sanction the Disannexation Act, and immediately took steps for carrying on the government under the immediate authority of the Crown, from the 13th March, 1884. Masupha tendered his submission in 1886, and asked for a magistrate to be resident in his district.

**Constitution.**

The territory is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for South Africa, the latter possessing the legislative authority, which is exercised by proclamation.

The chiefs adjudicate on cases between natives, with a right of appeal to the Courts of Assistant Commissioners where all cases between the natives and Europeans are brought. There is a Court of the Resident Commissioner, with jurisdiction in all cases, civil and criminal, subject to a right of appeal in certain civil cases to the Privy Council.

For fiscal and other purposes the country is divided into 7 districts namely, Maseru, Leribe,
Mohale's Hoek, Berea, Mateteng, Quthing, and Qacha's Nek. Each of the districts is subdivided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the Moshoeshi family. The revenue arises from the post office, native tax, the sale of licences, customs, and income tax.

Serious crime is rare, and the drinking habits, which threatened to destroy the people, have been to a great extent abandoned owing to the influence of the missionaries and the Government. The area under arable cultivation steadily increases, and there is less and less tendency to stock-thieving and petty warfare.

**Education.**

Excellent work is being carried on in the country by missionaries, in whose hands the labour of education is almost exclusively vested. There are 522 schools, with 41,852 scholars, a very large proportion being in the schools of the French Protestant Mission. There are eight small European schools with 124 pupils. There is also a Government Industrial School for natives at Maseru, with 45 pupils on the roll.

The Education vote for 1925-26 was £40,113, and a separate vote of £2,486 for the Government Industrial School.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no navigable waterways, the rivers being low in winter and flooded generally in summer. The usual mode of conveyance is by motor car, ox-wagon or light cart, and by pony riding off the roads and in the mountain areas.

The roads in the country are now in good condition for any kind of transport, but the periodical rains draining down from the high watersheds seriously damage them. Bridges have been constructed across the Hlotse river, the Khomokhoana river, the Caledon river at Ficksburg and Peka and the Little Caledon river near Maseru, across the Phutiatsana river near Teyateyaneng and the Makhaleng river near Mohale's Hoek, and over the Tsomeo and Tlametlu streams in Maseru district, and a causeway across the Telle River in the Quthing district. There are no railways through the country, but in December, 1905, the Central South African Railways opened a branch line running from Marseilles station on their Bloemfontein-Middelpoort line to a point just within the Basutoland border, and close to Maseru. A road and railway bridge has been built across the Caledon river at Maseru.

The line of postal communication is through the Cape Province and Orange Free State Province. Letters to and from Europe take about 20 days, to Cape Town 3 days. Postal rates are similar to those of the Union Post Office. Savings bank facilities and a money order system have been extended to Basutoland. The telegraph stations are Hlotse Heights, Teyateyaneng, Maseru, Morija, Mateteng, Mohale's Hoek, Quthing, and Qacha's Nek; while a Government telephone line runs throughout the country to all Government stations, except Qacha's Nek. There is telephonic communication with the Orange Free State and Matatiele in the Cape Province.

**Trade.**

The imports consist chiefly of blankets, ploughs, saddlery, clothing, iron and tin ware, and groceries. The exports consist chiefly of grain, cattle, wool, and horses. The commercial intercourse is almost exclusively with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State Province.

| Year | Exports | Imports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1922 | £669,330 | £702,125 |
| 1923 | £803,739 | £827,054 |
| 1924 | £968,810 | £942,279 |
| 1925 | £756,106 | £850,978 |

Basutoland from the 1st July, 1891, was admitted into a Customs Union with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State, by which arrangement a share of Customs duties collected at the ports of the Cape Province was credited to Basutoland, but retained by the Cape Government on account of the annual contribution of £18,000. Basutoland now receives, by arrangement, a proportion of Customs Revenue collected by the Union Government (see under South Africa, "Customs").

During the years 1908-21 a sum of £159,614, representing accumulated surpluses of previous years, was spent on works of a permanent character, such as hospitals, bridges, Government offices and quarters, leper asylum, roads, waterworks, etc.

**Currency and Banking.**

The Standard Bank has opened a branch in Maseru, and there are branches of Post Office Savings Bank at most of the Government Stations. The Bloemfontein Board of Executors has also opened a branch in Maseru, with a Savings Bank Department. The currency is exclusively British, but exchange, and occasionally the payment of taxes, is still largely conducted by barter.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |

BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE.

Situation and Area.

The territory of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the South and East by the Union of South Africa, on the North by Southern Rhodesia and the Zambesi and Chobe Rivers, and on the West by South-West Africa. Its area is estimated at about 275,000 square miles, and the population, according to the census taken on the 3rd of May, 1921, was 158,152, of whom 1,743 were Europeans or white.

In view of the geographical position of that part of the territory of South-West Africa East of longitude 21° East known as Caprivi Zipfel, the Zipfel is now administered as if it were a portion of the Bechuanaland Protectorate.

History.

During the year 1885, Sir Charles Warren, who was in command of an expedition despatched from England to pacify Southern Bechuanaland, where for some time previously hostilities had been proceeding between the Bechuana and Boers from the South African Republic, visited the principal chiefs in Northern Bechuanaland (known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate), Khama, Gaseitswe, and Sebele, and as a result a British Protectorate was proclaimed over their territories. No further steps were taken until the year 1891, when, by an Order in Council dated 9th May, the limits of the Bechuanaland Protectorate were more clearly defined, and the High Commissioner was authorised to appoint such officers as might appear to him to be necessary to provide for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue, and generally for the peace, order, and good government of all persons within the limits of the Order. Sir Sidney Shippard, the Administrator of Bechuanaland, was appointed Resident Commissioner, and an Assistant Commissioner was appointed for the Northern Protectorate, and another for the Southern Protectorate.

For fiscal and several other purposes the Protectorate was treated as a portion of the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland, until the latter was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 15th November, 1895. In the autumn of that year arrangements were made for the transfer of the administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, with the exception of certain reserves for native chiefs, to the British South Africa Company, and the Company's police were moved down to a camp in the Protectorate at Pitsane Potlugo. On the 29th of December Dr. Jameson, with his police, crossed the border of the South African Republic and marched towards Johannesburg, which was at the time in a state of great unrest, but being defeated by the Boers at Doornkop, surrendered on the 2nd January, 1896. In consequence of the raid, the administration of the Protectorate was not transferred to the Company. Since the annexation of British Bechuanaland to the Cape the Protectorate has been governed as a separate territory under the name of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and the form of government is very similar to that which obtains in Basutoland. There is a Resident Commissioner, who is under the direction of the High Commissioner, and there is an Assistant Resident Commissioner who is stationed at Francistown and is Chief Magistrate of the Territory. There are also Magistrates at Gaberones, Maun, Ghanzi, Serowe, Kanye.
Lehututu, Lobatsi, Molepolole, Kasane, Francistown and Selika. For the maintenance of law and order there is a force of police known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate Police, numbering 256. This force is under the direct control of the Resident Commissioner. There are 8 officers, 2 warrant officers, 18 European non-commissioned officers and men, and 50 Basuto non-commissioned officers and men (mounted), and 180 Bechuana dismounted constables. The police are stationed in small detachments at various places in the Protectorate. The headquarters of the Administration is at Mafeking, in the Cape Province.

Climate and Industries.

The climate is delightful during the winter and fairly healthy during seven months of the year. During the summer months malarial fever is generally prevalent.

The Protectorate is essentially a pastoral country, and although mealies and Kaffir corn are reaped by the natives in large quantities when the season is favourable, the rainfall is insufficient, or perhaps too uneven and uncertain in its distribution, to render agriculture anything but a hazardous pursuit. The staple product consists of horned cattle, of which, according to the census in 1921, the natives owned 436,344. They also owned 357,926 sheep and goats. A large quantity of fire-wood is exported by rail from the Southern Protectorate, chiefly to Kimberley, and a considerable quantity of timber suitable for mining props is also sent out of the country. Precautions are taken to see that none other than dead wood is exported for fuel, and that in felling trees for mining purposes only those of a certain size are used and only a certain limited number cut down in each locality. In the North, in the Tati district, gold mining has been carried on, on a small scale, for years. During the year 1925-26, 3,672 ozs. gold and 371 ozs. silver, of a total value of 15,469l. were produced.

Native Chiefs.

The principal chiefs are:

Tshokedi, Chief of the Bamangwato, whose chief town is Serowe (acting during minority of Chief Seretse).
Sebele II., Chief of the Bakwena, who lives at Molepolole.
Chiefstainness Ntebogai, Chief of the Bangwaketzi, who lives at Kanye (acting during minority of Chief Bathoesh).
Isang, Chief of the Bakgatla, who lives at Mochudi (acting during minority of Chief Kgafela).
Mathibe, Chief of the Batswana, who lives at Lake Ngami, near which at Maun there is a Resident Magistrate and a small detachment of police under a sub-inspector.
Seboko Mokgosi, Chief of the Bamalete, who lives at Ramotse.

Means of Communication.

The main trunk railway to the North, which connects Rhodesia with Cape Town and which has now been extended beyond the Victoria Falls, runs through the Protectorate. The line north of Vryburg in the Cape Province is the property of the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, to whom, under an agreement made in 1894, the Protectorate Government was to pay a subsidy of 20,000l. a year for ten years, which has now lapsed.

Finances.

| Year    | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1922-23 | £91,995 | £82,436     |
| 1923-24 | 100,235 | 81,809      |
| 1924-25 | 99,576  | 87,372      |
| 1925-26 | 107,344 | 104,173     |

Figures for 1923-24 are those which were settled after final audit adjustments had been made.

The estimated expenditure for the year ending the 31st March, 1927, is 100,450l., and the estimated revenue is 109,914l. The revenue is derived principally from Customs and Hut Tax, and the chief item of expenditure is police. Except as stated below, no customs duty is collected in the Protectorate, but under an Agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Customs revenue, calculated on the average receipts for three completed years prior to Union, is received from the Union Treasury. The Territory collects its own customs duties on spirits and beer manufactured in the Union of South Africa, or in any British Protectorate or possession in South Africa, the Government of which has entered into a customs agreement with the Union.
