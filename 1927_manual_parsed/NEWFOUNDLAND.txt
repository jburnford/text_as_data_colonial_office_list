NEWFOUNDLAND.

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 42,000 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom. Population, 259,338.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Hudson's Strait to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the Colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Canada. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom), with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound, the temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,300 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportsmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, amongst the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, Hebron, Ramah, and Killinek. The Customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norseman Lief, son of Eric the Red, in A.D. 1,000, and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton, fishermen. It became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863 and again in 1909. During the summer months several Justices of the Peace are upon the coast.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonise this island, but were not successful. In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert formerly took possession of the Island in the name of Queen Elizabeth, and it was incorporated into the realm of England. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the southeast part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which long remained in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brieux, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claimed the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they were allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right was an exclusive one was never admitted by Great Britain, which also contended that it did not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it did not pass the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi, which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1895 then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in each subsequent session the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December.

The dispute was finally settled by the Anglo-French Convention of the 8th April, 1904, in connection with other outstanding questions between the two countries. Under that Convention, France renounced the privileges under Art. xiii. of the Treaty of Utrecht (see Cd. 1952). The arrangement has been of great benefit to the Colony, since it removed an obstruction to local development, to mining and other industrial enterprises, over some two-fifths of the whole coast line.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Dried cod is the largest export (1,165,097 qts. in 1925); other large exports are herrings, lobsters, salmon, iron, fish oils, seal skins, and timber. Copper is worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pilley's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead, silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported.

The establishment of large and well-equipped paper mills at Grand Falls, in the interior, by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, has opened up a very large industry. The paper and paper pulp is shipped to the United Kingdom and used in the principal London printing offices. A model town has been laid out which is well lighted, watered, and drained. It is very picturesquely situated, and is on the line of the Reid Newfoundland Company's railway through the interior, while a private line of rail connects the works with Botwood, the principal port on the Exploits for summer shipments.

The Albert Reed Company, of London, have completed a large pulp mill at Bishop's Falls, about
constructed by the Government, connecting with tenants are descended from the Britis English being everywhere spoken, but
enon possess the small islands completed a large pulp mill at Bishop's Falls, about
nine miles from Grand Falls, where pulp is being manufactured for English mills. This company have also installed machinery for the manufacture of paper. At Lomond, in Bonne Bay, on the West Coast, the St. Lawrence Lumber and Pulp Co. are erecting large mills for the manufacture of lumber and pulp, and propose to erect mills for the making of paper. At Glovertown, on the Terra Nova River, Bonavista Bay, a company is now installing a plant for the manufacture of sulphite pulp. Both these companies will operate on a large scale.

The Humber development scheme, which has recently been launched by the Newfoundland Power and Paper Co., Ltd., with the full sanction of the Newfoundland Government, will utilize water power capable of developing hydro-electric energy of 250,000 horse power, and will involve the employment of more than 1,500 people, and the making of a new town at Comer Brook of about 7,000 people in the western portion of the Island. The mills will have a producing capacity of 400 tons of finished paper daily. Apart from the power required for the mills, there will be a surplus sufficient for all local or domestic purposes on the whole of the west coast, and also for the large mining areas in that part.

The scheme has received support from both the British and Newfoundland Governments, the British Government guaranteeing £2,000,000 under the Trade Facilities Act.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends north for over 1,000 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the export in 1924-25 was 1,163,097 quintals, value $10,445,617; 30 bank cod go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general run) per quintal would be 125. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Bank of Commerce have been opened in St. John's, branches of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace and in twenty-two other towns; branches of the Bank of Montreal at Carbonear, Bay of Islands, Grand Falls, and four other places; and seven branches of the Royal Bank of Canada at various points.

The legal tender currency (see Act IV. of 1895) is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Silver is legal tender to the extent of $10, and copper to the amount of 25 cents. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. Exchange $4.863 to the pound sterling.

In the Government Savings Bank deposits in 1925 were $2,014,155.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Carbonear, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $825,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance from Whitbourne of 200 miles, was built at a cost of $3,120,000. The line from Exploits, via Bay of Islands and Bay St. George, to Port-aux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is completed, the cost being $4,446,000. Branch lines to Carbonear, and Lewisport, N.D.B., are also completed. The total length of these lines, with branches, is about 638 miles. Other branch lines have been constructed to Bonavista, Hearts' Content, Grate's Cove and Trepassey, in all about 189 miles. By the transinsular railway regular connection is made with the continent thrice weekly, the intervening strait being crossed in the first-class passenger steamer "Caribou" which makes the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 5,200 miles of postal telegraph lines and 2,000 miles of postal telephones. The Government cable, laid in 1905 between Port-aux-Basques and Canoe in Nova Scotia, gives quick communication with both America and Europe. This cable was sold to the Commercial Cable Company in 1922. The Anglo-American cables start for Europe (at Hearts' Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable landed at St. John's, the Direct (now "Imperial") cable at Harbor Grace, and the Western Union at Bay Roberts, and all connect with both Europe and America. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, Boston and New York is made by private lines of steamers. The Furness-Withy Line of steamers runs between Liverpool and St. John's, and between St. John's, Halifax, and Boston, U.S.A., making about sixteen trips each way annually, monthly in winter, and at intervals of about three weeks in summer. The south and west coast has a weekly steamer service from Argentia, P.R., and also a fortnightly service per steamer from St. John's. Two steamers make trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer at intervals of eight to ten days, and another makes fortnightly trips between St. John's and Cape Norman in the north of the island, calling at all the important intermediate settlements. Smaller steamers ply on the five great bays, while another steamer visits each week the ports in the Strait of Belle Isle. All these steamers make close connection with the railway. The rates of postage are as follows:

| 1st oz.             |
| In St. John's       | 2 cents         |

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's is about 42°, the extreme range being from 0° to 81°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall in 1918 was 49 inches. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-
third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Beothuak tribe.

**Education.**

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1916 and its Amendment Act of 1920. By the new Act the Central Administration is vested in the Department of Education, presided over by the Minister of Education who is a member of the Executive Council. There are three Superintendents of Education belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican and the Methodist Denominations. There were in 1924, 1,461 schools with 58,093 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, and a small vote of $4,767 was passed for technical education. In 1910 a special grant of $100,000 was made for the erection, re-modelling and equipment of school buildings in places outside the city of St. John's.

In 1893 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object of fostering higher education in the Colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature.

A general Training School for teachers was opened in 1921, and in September, 1925, the first real attempt at University work was made, when the Newfoundland Memorial University College was opened, an institution which gives a two years' University Course. The Training School for teachers has been combined with the new College and the whole institution is now known as the Newfoundland Memorial University College and Normal School.

**Chief Towns.**

The capital is St. John's, with 37,047 inhabitants. Other towns of importance are Harbour Grace, with a population of 3,825; Bonavista, 4,052; Carbonear, 3,320; Twillingate, 3,217; Grand Falls, 3,769; Burin, 2,763, and Bay Roberts, 2,168. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the Cathedral and many Government buildings being burnt, with the public records which they contained. The city has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

**Constitution.**

Newfoundland has had a Legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1856. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1924—63,383 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding 500£ in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100£. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about the middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $150 each (President $250) per session. Members of the Assembly receive $1,000 each per session. The Speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The city of St. John's is governed by a Mayor and 6 Councillors elected under the provisions of the Municipal Act, 1921.

NEWFOUNDLAND—NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the South, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) within the boundaries of the Dominion: the chief of these are the Chatham Islands, 636 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43°-45° S. lat., 176-177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islands); and the Auckland Islands. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island and adjacent islets is 44,131 square miles, of the South Island 58,120 square miles, of Stewart Island 662 square miles, of Chatham Islands 372 square miles, and other islands, including the Cook Islands, 577 square miles, a total area of 103,862 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 & 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. long., and 33° and 53° S. lat., were annexed to New Zealand.

By Letters Patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, was annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macaulay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands was administered through the Governor of New Zealand until 1900; in October of that year the group was annexed to Her Majesty's Dominions, and resolutions were passed by the New Zealand Parliament for the extension of the boundary of the Dominion to include the group as well as Savage (Niue) Island and other small islands. By proclamation finally fixing the date from which the boundaries of New Zealand are deemed to be extended, from the 11th June, 1901, the following islands are included:—Rarotonga, Mangasia, Atiu, Atutaki, Mitiaro, Mauke, Hervey (Manuae), Palmerston (Avarau), Savage (Niue), Pukapuka (Danger), Nassau, Rakanga, Manihiki, Penrhyn (Tongareva), and Suwarrow.

An account of the Cook Islands is given below.

The principal Allied and Associated Powers, assembled at Versailles, decided that the islands of Western Samoa should be assigned under mandate to New Zealand; and a mandate was issued by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920, in favour of New Zealand. The group which lies about 400 miles N.E. from Fiji contains several islands, of which Savai'i and Upolu are the largest. The total area is some 1,260 square miles.

It was also decided that the phosphate island of Nauru (Pleasant Island), lying in 0°33' south latitude, and 166°55' east longitude, should be administered by New Zealand jointly with the United Kingdom and Australia.

By Order-in-Council of 30th July, 1923, the Government of the Ross Dependency, comprising the coasts of the Ross Sea and adjacent islands and territories, was transferred to the Governor-General of New Zealand.
Arrangements were made in 1925 for the administration of the Tokelau or Union Islands, part of the colony of Gilbert and Ellice Islands, to be taken over by New Zealand. This transfer was effected as from February 11th, 1926, on the publication of the Union Islands Orders in Council, 1925, in the respective Government Gazettes. The islands are administered by the Administrator of Western Samoa on behalf of New Zealand.

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the average death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (55°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (50°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington in 1925 was 48°3', from 78°2' in summer to 29°9' in winter. The rainfall varied for the year 1925 from 21½ inches on the east coast, to 124 inches on the west coast of the South Island, and from 25¾ inches on the east coast, to 55 inches on the west coast, and 61½ inches in the interior of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the 5 years 1921-1925 was 22·2 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 8·6. The birth rate in 1925 was 21·17 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 8·29. New Zealand has the lowest rate of infantile mortality in the world, a fact attributed to such matters as climate, virility of race, comparative absence of large industrial undertakings, and partly to legislative and educative measures. The average rate for the last 5 years was 43 per 1,000 births, and the rate for the year 1925 was 40.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840 the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Sava'i, in the Navigator, or Samoe, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1926, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 62,781, almost all of whom dwelt in the North Island. Contrary to the results found in other civilised countries the Maoris in New Zealand are steadily increasing.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by Letters Patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1860.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and a constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 & 16 Vict., cap. 72. By that Act New Zealand was divided into six provinces, afterwards increased to ten, but subsequently reduced to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vict., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers were now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished, provision was made for the division of the Dominion into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, consisting of the Governor (now Governor-General), a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor-General is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Dominion for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor-General, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments were made tenable for seven years only. Provision was made by legislation some years ago for an elective Legislative Council to consist of 40 European members and not more than 3 Maori members, the latter to be appointed by the Governor-General but the Act has not yet been brought into operation. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector, male or female, is qualified to become a member (the Women's Parliamentary Rights Act, passed in 1919, gives women the right to be elected to either house). The House of Representatives now consists of 80, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to October.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 315£. a year, payable monthly. Members of the House of Representatives receive 450£. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races) the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Dominion and three months in an electoral district, can be registered as an elector.
The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act, 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll. Compulsory enrolment of electors was introduced in 1924.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a property or residential one. Women can vote and are eligible for election as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the British to the New Zealand Government. In 1865 the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Dominion is divided into 119 municipalities and 129 counties; the latter being subdivided into 35 road districts and 69 town districts, besides River, Drainage, Water Supply, Local Railway, Harbour, and Electric Power Districts, a special Tramway District, and a Gas-lighting District.

For the year ended 31st March, 1925, the total receipts of the above local authorities amounted to £19,794,363l., and their expenditure to £19,422,833l. Their outstanding loans at the same date amounted to £45,720,794l., exclusive of £6,029,965l. outstanding in loans from the New Zealand Government State Advances Office, and also of £2,272,688l. inscribed by the Treasury under the now-repealed Local Bodies' Loans Acts and outstanding at 1st Feb., 1925. The net indebtedness on these various classes of loans was at the same dates £40,770,527l., £5,360,074l., and £1,128,522l., respectively. A class of local district not included in the statistical returns for which the above statistics are compiled consists of the Hospital Districts. The income of Hospital Boards for the year ended 31st March, 1925, was £1,633,604l., and the expenditure £1,584,361l.

Education.

A Government system of primary education was established in 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of nine Education Boards, and of School Committees with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of primary schools (called "public schools"), 2,580; scholars on roll, 214,724. Primary education is free, secular, and compulsory. In addition for native (Maori) education there are 128 village schools maintained by the Government and under the control of the Minister, eight Native mission schools, and eleven denominational boarding schools. Scholars on roll of village schools, 6,386 (including 797 Europeans); on the roll of mission schools, 366; and on roll of boarding schools, 536 of whom 140 hold Government free places. Net cost of native school education in 1925-26 was £77,000l. In the Chatham Islands three schools are maintained, and there are eight schools, under the control of the Cook Islands Administration, in the Cook Islands (including Niue). During the year 1925, 285 private primary schools with a roll number of 26,933 were registered under the Education Act. A School Journal providing suitable reading matter is provided by the Department and issued free to all children in Government schools. A comprehensive system of physical education and schemes of dental and medical inspection are in operation in the primary schools, the latter now being under the control of the Department of Health. Four training colleges make provision for the training of teachers, the total number in attendance during 1925 being 1,271. There is also provision for training classes at smaller centres. The number of adult primary school teachers in 1925 was 6,002, pupil teachers 360, and the number of probationers 641. The total expenditure by the Government under the head of primary education was for 1925-26, £2,323,723l. There is a system of superannuation for teachers giving an annuity of one-sixtieth of the average of the final three years' salary for each year of service.

Secondary education is provided at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools, the numbers of operative schools under each heading in 1925 being 38, 80, and 15 respectively, with a total roll number as follows:—Secondary schools, 12,514; district high schools (secondary departments), 3,136; technical high schools, 5,132. In addition 29 private secondary schools were registered under the Education Act, the roll number being 2,511. In scholarships and free places at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools 19,510 pupils received free secondary education. Provision is made for manual instruction in both primary and secondary schools, cookery, dressmaking, woodwork, elementary agriculture, dairywork, and the various branches of elementary science being included in the subjects taken. Instruction of a technical or vocational character is provided at a large number of technical schools and classes, besides the technical high schools mentioned above, the courses of instruction followed being commercial and general, industrial, domestic, agriculture, and art. The total number of students attending such classes in 1925 was 12,966, of whom 6,377 received free education.

For higher education there are four endowed colleges affiliated to the University of New Zealand, and each specializes in one or more directions. At Dunedin the special subjects are mining, medicine, dental, veterinary, and domestic science; at Christchurch, engineering and technical science; at Wellington, law and science; at Auckland, commerce engineering and mining. There is an agricultural college at Lincoln possessing a large endowment and an experimental farm of a very complete character. The number of students on the books of the University Colleges was, in 1925, 4,442, of which number 1,668 or 42 per cent. were receiving free education. The total expenditure by the Government on university education in 1925-26 was £170,533l.

The Child Welfare Act, 1925, provides for the creation of a special branch of the Education Department known as the Child Welfare Branch. The Act is designed to make better provision with respect to the maintenance, care and control of children who are specially under the protection of the State, and to provide generally for the protection and training of indigent, neglected, or delinquent children.

An important section of the Act provides for the establishment of Children's Courts, to be presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates or Justices specially authorized to exercise jurisdiction in these courts. Provision is made for the appointment
of honorary associates of either sex, whose function it will be to consider all the facts concerning children brought before the Courts and to advise the presiding Magistrate or Justice as to what action should be taken. The appointment of Child Welfare Officers for the investigation of all cases coming before the Courts has also been provided for.

The Act gives very wide discretionary powers to the Magistrates of these special Courts in dealing with children. The ordinary procedure of requiring the child to plead, of taking evidence on oath, and, in fact, of hearing the particular charge may be dispensed with altogether. Wherever practicable the Children's Court is to be held in premises apart from the ordinary Police Court, and no newspaper is permitted to publish either the names of children appearing before these Courts or any particulars that are likely to identify the child.

Another important provision contained in the Act authorises the Children's Court to exercise jurisdiction over any young person under eighteen years of age charged with any offence. Such cases would be referred by a Stipendiary Magistrate or Judge of the Supreme Court.

In order to provide for the greater protection of infants of unmarried mothers and for the assistance and guidance of the mothers themselves, there is provision for Child Welfare Officers, on being notified of such births, to investigate each case and to render such assistance as is required, either in placing the child in a suitable foster-home or in advising the mother in the matter of affiliation proceedings, or in assisting her in obtaining employment, etc.

In addition to the work in connection with the maintenance and education of destitute, neglected, and delinquent children committed by the Courts, the Child Welfare Branch (1) supervises all infants and young children under the age of six years who are living apart from their parents; (2) makes inquiry through its field officers, for the information of Magistrates, of all applications for the adoption of children and for widows' pensions; (3) supervises all children and young persons placed under the field officers by order of the Court; and (4) provides for the maintenance, education, and training of all afflicted children who are deaf, blind, feeble-minded or have speech-defects.

The total number of children under the supervision of the State in 1925-26 was 5,352, classed under the following headings:

- Boarded out, industrial schools, receiving-homes &c. . . . 3,859
- Juvenile probation . . . 323
- Infant-life protection . . . 771
- Deaf Children . . . 116
- Feeble-minded children . . . 283

The expenditure in 1925-26 in connection by the Child Welfare Branch was 112,263L.

For the financial year 1925-26 the total cost to the Education Department of the services mentioned above was 3,814,434L.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 20th April, 1926, was found by the census to be 1,344,384 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 62,781, and Cook and other Pacific Islands (13,833). The estimated population of New Zealand (including Maoris but excluding residents of Cook and other Pacific Islands), on 30th June, 1926, was 1,409,853.

The population of the four principal urban areas on the 2nd April, 1911; 15th October, 1916, 17th April, 1921; and 20th April, 1926, was as follows:

| Year | Wellington | Dunedin | Auckland | Christchurch |
|------|------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1911 | 64,372     | 41,529  | 40,536   | 53,116      |
| 1916 | 70,729     | 64,237  | 102,676  | 80,193      |
| 1921 | 73,305     | 55,266  | 64,951   | 54,925      |
| 1926 | 96,235     | 68,716  | 133,712  | 92,733      |

Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Dominion up to 31st December, 1925, was valued at 91,887,192L. The wool exported in 1925 amounted to 205,726,856 lbs., valued at 17,739,736L. In 1886 it amounted to 2,559,618 lbs., valued at 146,070L. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at 19,339L, had developed an export for 1889 of 656,922 cwt., valued at 783,374L, in 1898, 1,551,773 cwt., valued at 1,698,750L, in 1913, 2,878,693 cwt., valued at 4,449,933L, in 1924, 3,213,574 cwt., valued at 9,499,877L, and in 1925, 3,414,205 cwt., valued at 11,174,667L. The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1926, was: horses, 314,867 against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 3,452,486 against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 24,904,993 against 11,704,853 in 1874. The total area of occupied holdings over one acre in extent in 1926 was 43,606,829 acres; 151,673 acres were in wheat (for threshing only), having a total yield of 4,617,041 bushels. Of the area under oats for all purposes 102,485 acres were threshed, giving a total yield of 4,115,606 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton, Napier, Nelson, Wellington and Timaru are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1925, 579 vessels registered, of 123,693 (net) tons in the aggregate. Many of the larger vessels formerly on the register were transferred to the London register to take advantage of the Imperial War rates.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware and machinery, sugar, tea, tobacco, alcohol, books, stationery, motor vehicles and accessories, drugs and chemicals, and oils; and they are obtained almost entirely from the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, Canada, Ceylon, Japan and Pacific islands.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches, two are New Zealand Institutions, in the Dominion:— Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, Bank of Australasia, and Commercial Bank of Australia (Limited). The total amount of their deposits...
in New Zealand for the year 1925 (average of four quarters), was £52,207,202., and of their note circulation £6,775,470L. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Dominion, having on 31st March, 1926, 870 branches; the amount deposited therein at that date was £47,911,322L. The private savings banks number five, and the total amount to credit of depositors at March 31st, 1926, was £6,364,383L.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling, but the issues of the six banks carrying on in the Dominion have been declared legal tender until 10th January, 1927.

Government Life Insurance Department.

This department commenced to transact business in March, 1870. It is under the management of the Government Insurance Commissioner, and is conducted almost exactly on the same principles as those generally adopted by private mutual life offices.

It has canvassing agents, and pays its own expenses including postage and taxes.

The premiums originally adopted by the Department were extremely low, and were not framed to provide bonuses. Even with these small premiums, however, the methods of management, assisted by the low mortality of New Zealand, produced surpluses from the beginning. It was, however, quickly realized that it would be necessary to provide substantial bonuses to policyholders in order to enable the Department to compete successfully with the private offices. The rates of premium were therefore raised, but although higher than formerly, these rates are on the whole considerably lower than those charged by the private offices transacting business in the Dominion. Besides its low premiums the Department makes a feature of its liberal and sympathetic administration.

Profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policyholders themselves and are distributed triennially in the form of compound reversionary bonuses. The basis employed in the actuarial valuation—the most stringent in use by Australasian Offices, namely, the OM. (British Offices) Tables with interest at 3%—indicates the strength of the Department and when taken in conjunction with the fact that the rate of interest earned on the funds is over 5½% constitutes the best possible augury of future bonus prospects. The figures for the last ten years in respect of new business, premium income, funds, and total business in force are as follows:

| Year | Business | Premium Income | Funds at end of year | Business in Force |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1916 | 883,396  | 378,843        | 5,202,898           | 14,259,372        |
| 1917 | 784,600  | 383,727        | 6,199,320           | 14,188,774        |
| 1918 | 1,252,538| 399,672        | 5,191,745           | 14,770,543        |
| 1919 | 1,617,795| 411,307        | 5,354,904           | 15,546,744        |
| 1920 | 1,659,660| 435,816        | 5,642,552           | 16,259,310        |
| 1921 | 1,631,250| 460,302        | 5,726,356           | 17,279,734        |
| 1922 | 1,286,609| 473,141        | 5,922,825           | 17,449,101        |
| 1923 | 1,581,722| 489,171        | 6,222,485           | 17,906,612        |
| 1924 | 1,718,842| 511,380        | 6,448,658           | 18,887,164        |
| 1925 | 1,910,013| 537,674        | 6,731,118           | 19,593,329        |

It will be seen from these figures that the Department would in point of the magnitude of its operations take high rank even among the Insurance Companies of England.

State Fire and Accident Insurance.

Fire Branch.

In the year 1903 was passed an Act "to establish a State Fire Insurance Office and to make other provisions for the insurance and protection of insurable property in New Zealand against loss or damage by fire."

The statute provided for the establishment of an office to be administered by a General Manager appointed by the Governor-General, and for the necessary staff.

Provision is made for the constitution of a Board, to consist of the Minister of Finance, the General Manager and three other persons appointed by the Governor-General, of whom at least one shall be an officer of the Public Service. The appointed members hold office for two years with eligibility for re-appointment.

The Department opened for business with branches and agencies throughout the Dominion in January, 1905. The opening of the office resulted in a reduction in the rates then current of 3¾ per cent. on dwellings and the less hazardous risks, and of 10 per cent. on all others.

Under an Amending Act passed in 1922, the Board is authorised to declare rebates to insured persons out of surplus profits and the first rebate of 15% was declared for a period of 12 months from 8th August, 1923. As from 1st August, 1924, the rebate was reduced to 10%, and the operation of this rebate was extended to 31st December, 1925, in order that the period of future rebates might run concurrently with the financial year which ends on 31st December. A third rebate of 12½ per cent. is in operation as from 1st January, 1926.

The amount granted in rebates up to 31st December, 1925, is estimated at £50,500L, and as the Associated Companies adopted the same system of rebates as the State Office the total saving to the public is estimated at £413,234L.

The total accumulated profit made to the end of December, 1925, was £448,895L, and the net income and net losses for each of the ten years to that date have been as follows:

| Year | Net Income, less Re-insurances | Net Losses |
|------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1916 | 82,695                        | 21,898     |
| 1917 | 91,381                        | 27,302     |
| 1918 | 99,459                        | 29,872     |
| 1919 | 110,565                       | 23,211     |
| 1920 | 135,670                       | 21,182     |
| 1921 | 150,073                       | 38,126     |
| 1922 | 156,476                       | 46,091     |
| 1923 | 169,249                       | 46,178     |
| 1924 | 190,300                       | 60,817     |
| 1925 | 207,418                       | 56,997     |

Accident Branch.

The Government Accident Branch attached since January 1st, 1925, to the State Fire Insurance Office, was opened in 1901, for the purpose of transacting Personal Accident Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance. General accident business is undertaken, but the branch was opened more especially with a view to relieve employers of labour of the liability imposed upon them by "The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900." This Act greatly extended...
the liability of employers, and gave to a workman the right of compensation for all injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, not attributable to his own serious and wilful misconduct.

This liability has been extended by subsequent Acts, the principal amendments being in 1908, 1920, 1922 and 1926.

The scale of compensation is as follows:

(a) Where death results from the injury and the workman leaves dependants wholly dependent upon his earnings, the compensation is two hundred and eight times his average weekly earnings, but not to be less than £300, nor to exceed £1,000.

(b) If the dependants are only partially dependent upon the workman's earnings, the compensation is to be such sum as is reasonable and proportionate to the injury to such dependants, but not exceeding the amount payable under paragraph (a).

(c) In either of the above cases the employer is also liable for medical and burial expenses not exceeding £50, and an amount not exceeding this sum can be claimed where there are no dependants.

(d) Where a workman is totally incapacitated for work, he is entitled to a weekly payment of 66\(\frac{2}{3}\)% of his average weekly earnings. Persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour, whose earnings exceed £40 per year, are excluded from the benefits of the Act and the maximum weekly payment is limited to £1.

(e) Where the workman is partially incapacitated only, the compensation is 66\(\frac{2}{3}\)% of the loss of wages, with a maximum of £1 per week.

(f) In addition to the compensation for incapacity medical or surgical expenses are allowed, not exceeding £1.

Weekly payments are not to extend over a longer period than six years, and the aggregate amount is not to exceed £1,000.

The Department's policies cover the full liability of an employer to his workmen under the Workers' Compensation Act, and also suitably protect him against liability under the Deaths by Accident Compensation Act, and the Common Law.

Policies protecting mortgagees from loss through the charge of an injured workman taking precedence of a mortgage are issued at premiums varying from 1s. per cent. of the mortgage for small mortgages to 6d. per cent. for large mortgages.

Personal accident policies are also issued securing amounts for accidental death and permanent total or partial disablement, and weekly allowances during temporary disablement whether caused by accident or sickness.

Under the Government Accident Insurance Amendment Act of 1924, the Department is authorised to underwrite all classes of Accident Insurance accepted by Accident Insurance Companies, and the office now accepts motor car comprehensive, plate glass and fidelity guarantee insurance.

The premium income and claims of the Accident Branch during the last ten years have been as follows:

| Year                  | Premium Income | Claims |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------|
| Year ending 31st December, 1916 | 22,350         | 10,698 |
| "                     | 22,058         | 9,270  |

Public Works.

All the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony. In the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement, but in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made, and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under road boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1926, there were 3,138 miles of Government and 116 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand, and 340 miles of Government railway under construction. The construction of new lines and the extension of existing ones has proceeded steadily in recent years.

The expenditure on the 3,138 miles of opened Government railways has been £47,608,676, or an average of £15,172 per mile. This includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1925-1926 was £8,460,762, and the working expenses £6,164,570. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraph and inter-urban telephone circuits there are 13,032 miles of pole line and 59,791 miles of wire. There are 344 Morse telegraph offices, 1,868 telephone offices, and 341 telephone exchanges the latter having 125,372 connections with 11,057 miles of line and 402,433 miles of wire. 409 coin-in-the-slot telephones are in use.

There are now 20 automatic exchanges in operation and 7 in course of installation at places where the existing magneto systems cannot be economically extended. Extensions to telegraph, toll and telephone exchange systems are being proceeded with in all parts of the Dominion to meet the increasing demands for telegraph and telephone facilities. There are eight submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand; two Wellington-Sydney, one Auckland-
Sydney, and one Auckland-Brisbane, via Norfolk Island, connecting the Dominion with Australia, and one connecting Auckland with Suva.

The Pacific cable, which was opened for traffic to Australia and Fiji in April, 1902, was completed to Bamfield, Vancouver Island, on the 31st October following, and opened for international traffic on the 8th December, 1902. The laying of the Auckland-Suva cable was completed on the 25th August, 1923.

On the opening of the Pacific cable for through traffic the ordinary rate to Great Britain was 3s. per word, Government messages 1s. 6½d., and Press 1s. per word. On the 1st April, 1915, these rates were reduced to 2s. 8d. per word for ordinary messages, and 1s. 4½d. per word for Government messages, and on the 1st December, 1924, were further reduced to 2s. 3d., and 1s. 2½d., per word, respectively.

In 1909, the charge for Press messages was reduced to 9½d. per word, and in 1912, to 7½d. per word. A further reduction in the Press rate, to 6½d. per word, was made in 1925. In 1911, a deferred Press rate of 4½d. per word was instituted.

A system of deferred ordinary telegrams, i.e., telegrams subject to a delay of twenty-four hours, was introduced in 1912, these messages being accepted at one-half the ordinary rate.

Two other classes of cheap cable messages known respectively as Daily Letter Telegrams (which are subject to 48 hours delay during transmission) and Week-End Letter Telegrams are exchanged with the United Kingdom and Canada. The rates are as follows:

**Daily Letter Telegrams.**

|                | Per Word. | Min. Charge. |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| United Kingdom | 8½d.      | 1s. 4½d.     |
| Canada         | 6½d.      | 10½s. 0½d.   |

**Week-End Telegrams.**

|                | Per Word. | Min. Charge. |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| United Kingdom | 7½d.      | 1s. 8½d.     |
| Canada         | 5½d.      | 8½s. 0½d.    |

The average number of messages transmitted to and from New Zealand prior to the opening of the Pacific cable was about 425 per day. The present average is about 2,000 a day by both routes.

In the year ending 31st March, 1926, excluding the value of service messages, the telegraph revenue was £1,780,121L. (including telephone exchange and other telegraph receipts); number of messages 16,201,874 (of which number 16,143,414 were private or press messages). The minimum rate on ordinary telegrams is 9½d. for 12 words; additional words 1½d. each. Letter-telegrams (inland), for delivery by post on the morning of the day following lodgment, are accepted at the rate of 9½d. for the first 27 words and 1½d. for each additional 3 words.

There are sixteen radio coast stations in and around New Zealand, which are under the control of the New Zealand Government, namely: Awanui, Auckland, Wellington, Awarua, on the mainland and in addition Chatham Islands, Kawau Island and Stephens Island on the Islands of those names off the coast of New Zealand, Puysegur Point (at the entrance to Preservation Inlet), Aitutaki, Mangaiia and Rarotonga, in the Cook Group; Apia, Aleipata, Fagamalo, and Tuasivi, in Western Samoa; and Niue Island. Of these, all but Awanui, Awarua and Apia are low power stations; and all but Niue Island which is a radio-telephone station, are radiotelegraph stations. The small stations at Aitutaki, Aleipata, Fagamalo, Tuasivi, Kawau Island, Mangaiia, Niue Island, Puysegur Point and Stephens Island engage exclusively in point-to-point communication. By means of the Awanui and Apia stations communication is maintained between New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.

In addition there are 48 wireless ship-stations registered in New Zealand.

Tramways have been established in most of the principal towns in New Zealand.

Auckland, Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, New Plymouth, Invercargill, Napier and Wanganui have electric tramway systems on the overhead principle, while a system in Gisborne is worked with storage battery cars. In Wellington and Dunedin there are cable tramways connecting with the higher levels. In Wanganui the higher levels of Campbelltown are reached by means of an elevator. In Christchurch, in addition to electricity, some casual traffic is operated by means of steam tramway locomotives.

The total expenditure by the General Government on the construction of roads and bridges from the inauguration of the Public Works policy in 1870, till the end of March, 1926, amounted to £16,358,870L., including expenditure by the Main Highways Board.

The Government has also expended £77,408L. on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels, and £82,975L. in aiding works on mineral lands, etc.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations.

All the principal towns in the Dominion have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas.

The electrical supply in the Dominion is now largely in the hands of electric power boards. Until 1915, when the Government schemes at Lake Coleridge commenced supply, the distribution of the power was carried out by local authorities and companies operating various power stations, subject to licenses issued under the Public Works Amendment Act, 1911. On the Government entering into the business of generating electricity it was found desirable to delegate the responsibility for the distribution to the local authorities. The smaller local authorities had only a few hundred consumers each, and with annual revenue ranging from 1,000L. to 4,500L. each were found too small to take a comprehensive grasp of the commercial problems involved. The Electric Power Board Act of 1918 set up a new local authority especially charged with the responsibility of electric power supply and its retail distribution. The areas to be constituted are determined by petition, which must be signed by at least 25 per cent. of the ratepayers in the proposed district. The Board is elected by the ratepayers of the various constituent areas of the district, and has full powers of borrowing for the construction of works and rating to make up any deficiency in the revenue. The areas of the power districts are intended to be large, and to include several constituent local districts, boroughs or counties. The Boards have wide powers to purchase energy from the Government when available, or to develop it from water power or any other source where such a supply is not available. Up to March, 1926, forty-two Boards had been gazetted covering an area equal to 64 per cent. of the total area of the Dominion and
containing 61 per cent of the total population of the Dominion. The unimproved value of the land included in the above area equals 78 per cent of the total unimproved value of the Dominion. Thirty-five Boards have so far taken their loan polls, and have received authority from their ratepayers to borrow a total of 10,121,783L. Nineteen Boards are distributing power purchased in bulk from the Government hydro-electric plants at Hora Hora, Mangahao or Lake Coleridge. One Board has taken over a large city steam power-house, and is extending both the generating plant and the mains. It has also agreed to take the whole of its power from the Government when the Arapuni plant is completed in 1926. Six Boards have their own power stations in operation and two others are constructing water power plants. Eight others are constructing distribution lines and will purchase power from the Government Stations. Three others have arranged to purchase power in bulk from other authorities. Including the Government stations, there are 34 water power plants, 8 gas power plants, 6 steam power plants and 3 oil power plants making a total of 51 plants with a total installed capacity of 127,017 kilowatts. The total population included in the various areas of electric power supply is 80 per cent of the total population of the Dominion. The maximum demand per head of population in the areas supplied is 0·079 kilowatts and the units sold per head of population supplied were 241. The total length of distribution lines, mostly overhead, is 12,454 route miles. Out of the 101 distributing authorities 71 showed a profit, for the year ended 31st March, 1926, amounting to 276,426L., and 28 showed a loss amounting to 91,667L., making a nett profit for the whole Dominion of 184,759L.

The Dominion is particularly well supplied with available water power, the total available in sources of 1,000 h.p. or over is about 770,000 h.p. in the North Island and 4,100,000 h.p. in the South Island. Of the 127,017 kilowatts of installed capacity in the power stations of the Dominion, 89,068 kilowatts, or 70·1 per cent, is driven by water power, and the proportion is increasing each year. The Government have three hydro-electric plants in operation and two under construction. Those in operation are Lake Coleridge 27,000 kilowatts, Hora Hora 13,000 kilowatts and Mangahao 24,000 kilowatts. The schemes under construction are Arapuni 45,000 kilowatts, (ultimately 120,000 kilowatts) and Waikaremoana 30,000 kilowatts capable of extension to 97,000 kilowatts. Current is transmitted from Lake Coleridge at 66,000 volts, Hora Hora at 50,000 volts and Mangahao 110,000 volts. In order to carry out the construction of the Government schemes, the following authorizations have been passed by Parliament:

Aid to Water Power Act, 1910.
Lake Coleridge and other Works £500,000

Electric Power Works Loan, 1919.
Arapuni Electric Power Works £4,500,000
Mangahao Electric Power Works £1,600,000
Extensions to Lake Coleridge electric power works 257,500
Hora Hora Electric Power Works purchase 212,500
Extensions to Hora Hora Electric Power Works 200,000
Waikaremoana Scheme Surveys 30,000
Otago Scheme Surveys 30,000

Finance Act, 1920.
Waikaremoana Electric Power Works £2,600,000
Kaituna River Electric Power Works 150,000
Extensions to Lake Coleridge 720,000
Other Surveys 30,000

The total capital outlay on all plants in the Dominion in operation at March 31st, 1926, was 16,516,684L., the units were 264,994,867 and the number of consumers 137,527.

The coasts of the Dominion are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Thames Gisborne, Wairoa, Napier, Wanganui, Patea, New Plymouth, Opunake, Waitara, Nelson, Westport, Greymouth, Hokitika, Wairau, Lyttelton, Timaru, Oamaru, and Dunedin. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.

Road and railway formation works are carried out under contracts and by the co-operative system, under which the Government provides all materials and lets the work of construction to parties of labourers and artisans at rates fixed by Government officers on the ground. These rates are calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 16s. to 18s. per day for artisans, and from 13s. to 14s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day. Buildings and large bridges are built by contract, let after inviting tenders through the press.

Mail Communication.
There is regular mail communication with England and Europe and with Australian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States and Canada.

Postage Rates.
The postage on letters inland is 1d. for the first ounce or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each additional ounce or fraction thereof, and to such places as accept matter at the reduced rate, 1d. for the first ounce or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each additional ounce or fraction thereof. The reduced rate applies in any case to British possessions, and to a number of foreign countries. The letter postage to other places beyond New Zealand is 2½d. for the first ounce, and 1½d. for each succeeding ounce, or fraction thereof. The inland rate for newspapers is ½d. each. The minimum rate for newspapers printed and published in New Zealand, for the United Kingdom, is 1d. for each newspaper, irrespective of weight, but subject to certain conditions as to despatch. The ordinary rate for Australia and New Guinea (except Dutch New Guinea) and certain other British possessions is 1d. for each newspaper. The rate for newspapers for other places, and for newspapers not printed and published in New Zealand addressed to the United Kingdom, is for each newspaper:- ½d. for each 2 ounces or fraction thereof. The inland parcel post rates are:- 6d. for the first lb. and 2½d. for each additional lb. up to 10 lbs., and 1½d. for each additional lb. up to 28 lbs. The postage rates applicable to an 11 lb. parcel are charged on all parcels (except parcels containing fishing rods, golf clubs or similar articles) that weigh less than
11 lb. if such parcels exceeds 4 ft. length and girth combined. A fragile fee is charged on all inland parcels which the senders desire forwarded to destination in hampers, the fee being 9d. in cases where length and girth combined exceed 4 ft., and when parcels, not exceeding 1 in. in thickness, exceed 4ft. in length and width combined. In all other cases the fee is 6d.

**DEPENDENCIES OF NEW ZEALAND.**

**Cook Islands.**

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and Manuae, Te Au-o-Tu and Takutea (at that time known as the Hervey Group) by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889. The latter name has fallen into disuse, all of the Islands collectively being known as the Cook Group.

Until 1901 British authority was represented by a Resident who was paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reported direct to the Governor of that Dominion. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moss, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continued to enjoy self-government in such purely local affairs as it could properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government was composed of the Ariki, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, was the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court was established, and a law was passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts were subject to the approval of the Resident, who was also a Deputy and Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and Chief Justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands.

The Islands became part of the Dominion of New Zealand from the 11th June, 1901. The administration and laws were continued in force subject to the provisions of the Cook Islands Government Act, passed in that year.

In 1915 an Act was passed by the New Zealand Parliament consolidating the laws relating to the Cook Islands and Niue Island, and providing for the appointment of a member of the Executive Council of New Zealand as the Minister for the Cook Islands, who is charged with the administration of the government of the Islands.

The Act also makes provision for the constitution of Island Councils; for the establishment of public schools, Courts of Justice, Native Land Court, etc.

The population of the Cook Islands on 20th April, 1926, was 13,833 (including Niue).

**Minister for the Cook Islands,** Hon. Sir Maui Pomare, K.B.E., C.M.G., M.P.

**Secretary, Cook Islands Department,** Wellington, J. D. Gray.

**Resident Commissioner at Rarotonga,** H. F. Ayson.

---

**Rarotonga.**

Distant from Auckland, 1,638 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 2,100 ft.; area, 26 square miles; population, 3,936.

Rarotonga is the most fertile and valuable of the Cook group, and it has the largest population. The island has been exceptionally favoured by nature, not only with delightful scenic attractions, but also with a remarkably rich and productive soil.

The aborigines are very closely akin to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The seat and centre of the government of the Cook Islands—the double township of Avarua and Avatiu—is situated on the north or lee side of the island of Rarotonga, opposite two small openings in the coral reef. The former has the advantage of a boat harbour, where small craft can be moored in safety when the wind is not blowing in from the sea. The residence of the Commissioner is situated here.

New Zealand postal notes apply in the Cook Islands and a government money-order office is in operation. Wireless stations are established at Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Mangaia, Atiu and Niue, and further stations are to be installed as funds permit.

The total value of exports from the Cook Islands for 1925 was £151,939l., and imports amounted to £130,609l. The principal items of export were fresh fruit, coconuts, copra and shell.

Revenue and expenditure of the Cook Islands for the year 1925-26: Revenue, £28,759l.; expenditure, £23,415l.

---

**Mangaia.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 110 miles; circumference, 30 miles; height, 656 ft.; area, 30 square miles; population, 1,249.

A government wireless station has been established here.

Mangaia is the most southerly island of the Cook group, and is second in importance to Rarotonga.

Coconuts, bananas, oranges, limes, citrons and other fruits grow plentifully.

**Resident Agent,** J. C. Cameron.

---

**Atiu.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 374 ft.; area, 22 square miles; population, 933.

A wireless station has been erected at Atiu.

Atiu resembles Mangaia in formation, being a raised mass of coral with high jagged cliffs facing the sea.

On the highest point of the central ridge coconuts, bananas, oranges, and coffee grow with the utmost luxuriance; and the kumera, one of the most valuable of South Sea vegetables, yields large crops. The coconut-palm grows well everywhere, but especially so on the coral rock formation.

**Resident Agent,** W. H. Scott.

---

**Mauke.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 151 miles; circumference, 10 miles; height, about 60 ft.; area, 5½ square miles; population, 511.

Mauke is a low circular island about two miles across, lying to the north-east of Rarotonga. Like Mangaia and Atiu, it is surrounded by an unbroken
fringing reef. It is marvellously fertile, and produce of considerable value and quantity is exported.

Resident Agent, J. Dyer.

MITIARO.

Distant from Rarotonga, 142 miles; circumference, 5 miles; height, about 50 ft.; area, 6 square miles; population, 238.

This island is a good instance of an elevated coral reef, thinly coated with sand and gravel of the same material. The surface is not more than six feet above high-water mark.

Resident Agent, Tou Ariki.

TAKUTEA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area, ½ square mile; population nil.

This island was presented to the Crown by the Ariki of Atiu to whom it belonged. It is a coral island, moderately fertile.

AITUTAKI.

Distance from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 14½ miles; height, 450 ft.; area, 7 square miles; population, 1,431.

The name includes the island anciently known as "Ara-ura," and some seven or eight smaller islands on the vast barrier reef. Some of these are volcanic, and would seem to have been small peaks on the lip of an extinct volcano, now submerged.

The island itself is pear-shaped, about four miles by two; its highest part being 450 feet high.

Copra is the chief production, and some of the best oranges and pineapples on the market are grown here.

The Aitutakians are naturally a hardy race, and industrious. They are said to be the best sailors in the Cook group. They make fans and mats, and are expert at plaiting various fibres for hatmaking.

A wireless station has been erected on the island.

Resident Agent, E. C. Vellenoweth.

MANUAU AND TE AU-O-TU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 128 miles; area of Manuae, 2½ square miles.

These two small islands are situated about midway between Atiu and Aitutaki, and are owned by the people of the latter place.

NIUE.

Distant from Auckland, 1,343 miles, and from Rarotonga, 590 miles; circumference, 40 miles; height, 200 ft.; area, 100 square miles; population, 3,795, census, 1926. Steamer connection from Auckland—about six trips each year are made. In order to establish communication with New Zealand, and also with the remaining islands of the Cook group, a wireless station has been erected.

Niue, or Savage Island, was placed under a separate administration by an Amending Act of 1903. Is a long, low island, fringed with a misty cloud of fine spray. The shores being too deep and steep to support a barrier reef, the coastline is deprived of its protection. It is fertile, but fresh water is very scarce.

Much of the land is encumbered with a dense scrub of guava bush.

The orange, the coconut, the banana, and other tropical products grow well, and the lemon flourishes on the rocky shores. Experiments in cotton growing have been most successful and the product highly reported upon by the British Cotton Growing Association.

The natives of Niue are somewhat different in character from other Polynesians. They are very industrious. The girls and women plait hats, which are exported to New Zealand and Australia. They are keen traders, but are averse to strangers obtaining a foothold in the island itself.

The exports for 1925 amounted to 17,429l., and the imports to 18,747l. The revenue for 1925-26 was 5,983l., and the expenditure 3,080l. The principal exports were copra, 13,863l.; hats, 1,347l.; fungus, 263l.; bananas, 1,747l.

Resident Commissioner, A. A. Luckham.

PALMERSTON ATOLL.

Distant from Rarotonga, 277 miles; area, 1 square mile; population, 90.

The Palmerstons are situated upon an irregular ring of coral reef, measuring outside about four miles and a half by two miles and a half, just awash with the tide. The narrow ring is about half a mile in width, and it supports eight little islets, nearly all covered with coconut palms. The largest of these is little more than half a mile in length and about a quarter of a mile wide.

Copra is the only article of export.

Resident Agent, J. Marsters.

PENRHYN

Distant 740 miles from Rarotonga; area, 3 square miles; population 395.

This atoll is known to the Polynesians as Tongareva or Ma-ngaro-ngaro and is valuable only by reason of the existence of pearlshell beds in the extensive lagoon. The lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling pearlshell diving have been made.

The coconut crop is considerable. Fresh water is very scarce, and large concrete tanks have been built by the Administration in the various villages for storage of rain water.

Resident Agent, W. Wilson.

SUWARROW.

Distant from Rarotonga, 525 miles; area, ½ square mile. It is uninhabited.

Suwarrow is an atoll with a splendid lagoon, which produces a very good class of pearlshell. Part of the anchorage has been gazetted as a naval reserve. The remainder of the Island is leased to Capt. Harries, of Rarotonga.

MANIHIKI AND RAKAHANGA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 650 and 670 miles respectively; area, each 2 square miles; population, Manihiki, 416; Rakahanga, 327.

Manihiki is nearly circular. Béche-de-mer is obtained from the lagoon. The island occasionally suffers from drought and similar tanks to those at Penrhyn have been erected.

Rakahanga is also an atoll.
The former has until lately produced a limited amount of pearlshell, but about the end of 1900 it was found that the beds were exhausted by over-fishing. The Manihiki lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling diving made as in the case at Penrhyn.

The only industry is now that of copra-making.

Resident Agent, H. Williams.

Pukapuka, or Danger Island.

Pukapuka is a small solitary atoll about three miles in diameter, which produces pearlshell. It is 720 miles from Rarotonga, and has an area of two square miles. The population is 526 persons.

Nassau.

This small island has an area of about 360 acres, of which 300 acres are under cultivation with coconuts. It lies a few miles distant from Pukapuka. The plantation belongs to the Samoa Shipping and Trading Coy., Ltd., of Sydney. There is no indigenous population. The present residents consist of labourers, introduced by the Company to work the plantation.

Education.

The control of education in the Cook Islands has, by the Cook Islands Act, 1915, been placed under the Minister for the Cook Islands. Four schools have been established in Rarotonga. Schools have also been established at Aitutaki, Mauke, Palmerston, Mangaias, and Atiu. The instruction given is similar to that of the New Zealand State Schools. Technical instruction is being made a special feature.

At Niue Island there are two schools conducted on the same lines.

Trade of Cook Islands.

Oranges, bananas, tomatoes, and copra are the chief exports and trade is developing satisfactorily. Tomatoes are sent to New Zealand in winter and spring.

The Wellington-San Francisco mail steamer makes 4 weekly calls (North and South bound) at Rarotonga, and during the fruit season (April to September) regular monthly visits are paid by cargo steamer from Auckland to Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Mangaia and Mauke.

**THE ROSS DEPENDENCY.**

The Ross Dependency, the government of which was placed under the Governor-General of New Zealand by Imperial Order-in-Council of 30th July, 1923, is defined as “all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of east longitude and the 150th degree of west longitude, which are situated south of the 60th degree of south latitude.” The dependency includes Edward VII Land, and portion of South Victoria Land. There are no permanent inhabitants of the territory, but whaling is carried on by a Norwegian firm under licence.

Captain G. S. Hooper is the New Zealand Government representative and administrative officer.

**TOKELAU OR UNION GROUP.**

**BRITISH.**

This Group consists of three islands, or groups of islets (Atafu, Nukunonu and Fakaofo), and lies about 4 degrees due north of Apia, Samoa. Copra is the chief article of trade.

The Natives are Polynesians, numbering slightly over 1,000 and the language is allied to that of Samos. The islanders are ruled by their own Chiefs with the assistance of Native Village Committees.

An invitation from the British Government that the New Zealand Government should take charge of the Union Islands was accepted in 1925, and the administration of the Group was accordingly transferred from the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific to the Governor General of the Dominion on February 11th, 1926, by the publication of the Union Islands Orders in Council, 1925. The Islands are administered from Apia, Samoa, which is the nearest natural trading port and (since 1923) the port of entry for the Group.

---

**WESTERN SAMOA.**

The Territory of Western Samoa, formerly in the possession of Germany, was seized and occupied by New Zealand Troops on behalf of the Imperial Government on the 29th August, 1914. It remained in military occupation during the war, and was surrendered by Germany under the Treaty of Peace to the Allied and Associated Powers, by whom the mandate to govern the ex-German territory was assigned to the Dominion of New Zealand. The mandate was approved by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920.
On the 1st May, 1920, by Orders passed by the Governor-General of New Zealand in Council, provision was made for the Civil Administration of the Territory; and by the Samoa Act, 1921, of New Zealand, the constitution and legal system of the territory were settled.

Western Samoa is administered by an Administrator appointed by the Governor-General of New Zealand and responsible to the Minister of External Affairs (a member of the N.Z. Executive Council who is charged with the Government of the territory). There is a Legislative Council consisting of not less than four nor more than six official members appointed by the Governor-General and of three elected members, chosen by the votes of European population. The Administrator, acting with the advice and consent of this Council, is empowered to make Ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, subject to disallowance by the Governor-General. A High Court is established, and the Supreme Court of New Zealand is given jurisdiction over Western Samoa.

The Samoan natives are to a large extent granted domestic self-government.

The Fono of Faipules (Native Parliament, leading chiefs representing every district) who are appointed by the Administrator, meet twice yearly to consider matters relative to native welfare and draft native orders for submission to the Government.

Administrator of Samoa, Major-General Sir G. S. Richardson, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G.
Secretary Samoa Administration, Colonel J. W. Hutchen, C.M.G., C.B.E.

The Territory consists of the Islands of Upolu, Savai'i, Apolima, and Manono, together with several small islets lying between the 13th and 16th degree S. Lat., and 171st and 173rd degrees West Long., situated some 130 miles North of Tonga and 450 miles N.E. of Fiji. The sailing distance from Auckland (N.Z.) is 1,560 miles, from Sydney 2,570 miles, and from San Francisco 4,490 miles.

The total area of Western Samoa is 725,000 acres. 143,600 acres are alienated, of which (apart from native cultivation) 18,050 acres are under cultivation. The main products for 1925 were copra, 15,210 tons (of which three quarters was produced by the Natives), cocoia, 678 tons, all European produced. 1,750 acres of hevea rubber are being returned to cultivation, and the production of cotton by natives has been commenced.

There is a four-weekly steamer between Auckland and Apia, which connects en route with the San Francisco-Sydney mail steamers at Suva (Fiji), and also a four-weekly connection at Pago Pago (American Samoa), with the same service. The bulk of the produce is carried direct to England and Europe by cargo steamers.

A radio station situated at Apia works directly with New Zealand and Honolulu, and is also the transmitting station for the stations at Fiji, Tonga, Rarotonga and Tahiti.

Postal and Banking.—New Zealand postage rates apply in the Territory. A Government Money Order and Savings Bank Office and a Branch of the Bank of New Zealand are in operation at Apia. British currency is in circulation.

**Medical Services.**—A Government Hospital is maintained at Apia, with a staff of European doctors and nurses; district hospitals have been established at Tuasivi (Savai'i) and Aleipata (Upolu). The medical services of Samoa are a feature of New Zealand's administration, and annual reports thereon are made by the New Zealand Government to the League of Nations.

Dangerous fevers and reptiles are unknown.

**Roads and Locomotion.**—Roads radiate from Apia chiefly following the coast line. Motor traffic is rapidly developing both on land and on water, some 260 motor vehicles being registered. The coral lagoons form natural highways around many parts of the Islands.

**Climate.**—The climate is tropical and very equable. The wet season extends from December to March, the remainder of the year being pleasant, with trade winds blowing.

SOUTH AFRICA.

The Union of South Africa is constituted under the South Africa Act, 1909 (9 Edw. 7, ch. 9), passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on the 20th September, 1909. In terms of that Act the self-governing Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony became united on the 31st day of May, 1910, in a legislative Union under one Government under the name of the Union of South Africa, those Colonies becoming original provinces of the Union under the names of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State respectively.

The Act constituting the Union provides for the appointment by the Sovereign of a Governor-General, who, with an Executive Council (of which the members are chosen and summoned by him), administers the executive government of the Union as the Governor-General in Council. Departments of State are established by the Governor-General in Council, the Governor-General appointing not more than ten officers to administer them. Such officers are King's Ministers of State for the Union and members of the Executive Council.

The Senate consists of forty members. For ten years after the establishment of the Union eight were nominated by the Governor-General in Council and thirty-two were elected, eight for each province. The first election was made prior to the establishment of the Union by the two Houses of each of the Colonial Legislatures sitting as one body, and a vacancy will be filled by the choice of the Provincial Council in respect of whose province a vacancy occurs.

The first Senate automatically dissolved in 1920 and a new senate was appointed early in 1921.

The House of Assembly consists of 135 elected members, 51 of whom represent the Cape of Good Hope, 17 Natal, 50 Transvaal, and 17 the Orange Free State. Members of both Houses must be British subjects of European descent.

The qualifications of voters are the same as in the Colonies at the time of union, and no subsequent law is to disqualify any person in the Cape from voting, by reason of his race or colour, who could vote under the existing law, unless the bill is passed by both Houses together, with a two-thirds majority of the total membership. [In the Transvaal and Orange River Colony the franchise was restricted to white men; in Natal a native could obtain a vote, but under conditions which made this very difficult; in Cape Colony any native could do so who has a certain property qualification and can write his name.]

Pretoria is the capital and seat of government of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Legislature.

The first Parliamentary Election under the South Africa Act was held on the 15th September, 1910, and the Union Parliament was opened by H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught, K.G.

Provinces.

A Provincial Council in each province has power to legislate by ordinance on certain subjects specified in the Act, and on such other subjects as may be delegated to it. The specified subjects include direct taxation for provincial purposes, the borrowing of money on the credit of the province, primary education (for five years), agriculture, hospitals, municipal institutions, local works other than railways and harbours, roads, markets, game preservation and other purely local or private matters. In addition the Union Parliament may delegate the power of making Ordinances on any subject to Provincial Councils. All ordinances passed by a Provincial Council are subject to the veto of the Governor-General in Council. Members of the Provincial Council are elected on the same system as members of Parliament, but the restriction as to European descent does not apply. The number of members in each Provincial Council is as follows:

- Cape of Good Hope ... ... ... 51
- Natal ... ... ... ... 25
- Transvaal ... ... ... ... 50
- Orange Free State ... ... ... 25

The first Provincial elections for the Cape of Good Hope and the Transvaal were held on the 15th September, 1910; those for Natal and the Orange Free State on the 12th October, 1910.

The executive power in the subjects on which the Provincial Council is empowered to make ordinances is vested in an Executive Committee consisting of an Administrator, appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and four members elected by the Provincial Council.

Areas and Population.

Of the total 6,928,580 persons (1921), 3,536,992 were males and 3,391,588 females.

The increase for the Union (1911-21) was 15'99 per cent. For the Provinces it was as follows:—Cape, 8'49 per cent.; Natal, 19'71 per cent.; Transvaal, 23'81 per cent.; Orange Free State, 19'06 per cent.

The population comprised (1921) 1,519,488 Europeans or whites (737,453 females); 5,409,092 non-Europeans (natives, Asiatics, and other coloured) (2,654,135 females). In 1911 the figures were:—Europeans, 1,276,242 (increase 1911-21 of 19'06 per cent.); non-Europeans (natives, Asiatics, and other coloured), 4,697,152 (increase 1911-21, 15'16 per cent.)

**Climate.**

**Cape Province.**

The climate of the Cape Province is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice is practically unknown except in the more elevated localities, particularly of the north-east. The mean annual temperature at the Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, in 33° 56' S. lat., and 18° 29' E. long., is 62·0°, the mean maximum being 70·4°, and the mean minimum 53·6°; the average rainfall for the last 80 years is 25·40 inches. Cape Town itself has a mean annual temperature of 62·6°, the mean day temperature being 71·8° and the mean night temperature 53·4°. Aliwal North, 30° 41' S. lat., and 26° 40' E. long. (4,350 feet above sea level), shows a mean temperature of 59·2°, the mean maximum being 74·2°, and the mean minimum 44·3°; the rainfall average of 45 years being 20·36 inches. At the Royal Observatory the warmest days occur in February, when the average maximum is 79·2° F., and the coldest nights in July, with an average minimum of 47·2° F.; compared with these data the average maximum temperature of the warmest month (February), in Cape Town, is 81·8°, and the average minimum of the coldest month (July), is 47·4°; at Aliwal North, January and February are the warmest months, the day temperature averaging 82·5°, whereas in July, when the coldest nights are experienced, the average minimum is only 29·1° F.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (November to April), in the Western districts during the winter months, while along the south coast the rainfall is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the twelve months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

**Natal Province.**

The climate of the Natal Province varies at different levels. On the coast-line it is subtropical, but is considerably modified inland owing to increased altitude. Thus Umzinto in the south near the coast, at an altitude of 400 feet, has a mean annual temperature of 69·2°; Durban (261 feet), 70·8°; whilst Howick, at an elevation of 3,439 feet, has an average yearly temperature of 63·0°. In the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced. Snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer and the sky is bright throughout the winter months. Hot winds occasionally occur towards the end of the year (September-November), when temperatures of 100° to 110° may be recorded. At Pietermaritzburg (2,200 feet) the annual temperature is 66·6°, with an average maximum of 79·9° and a minimum of 53·4°. The warmest days occur in February, when the mean maximum averages 85·3° and the coldest nights in June, when the mean minimum is 41·3°. Again, Weenen (2,840 feet), situated in a deep cup-shaped valley, has a mean annual temperature of 66·4°, the mean maximum being 83·7°, and the mean minimum 49·2°; the hottest month is December, when the mean maximum is 92·7°, and the coldest nights are experienced in July, when the mean minimum is only 31·4°.

The average rainfall over the Province is approximately 34 inches, being about 40 inches along the coast belt (Durban 44·87 inches) and mostly about 30·00 inches inland, but decreasing to 27·01 inches at Weenen. Thunderstorms are frequent and destructive hailstorms are common during the summer months.

Malarial fever was epidemic in coast districts during 1905 and 1906, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the authorities, it has been stamped out, while very few cases have occurred inland.

**Transvaal Province.**

Owing to the altitude (4,000 to 6,000 feet) of the plateau constituting the greater part of the Transvaal Province, the climate on the whole is healthy, cool and bracing; over the Lowveld to the north and east, however, it is hot and fever-stricken, and not at all adapted for stock owing to various endemic diseases. During summer the days are hot, occasionally exceeding 100 deg., but tempered by frequent thunderstorms, while the nights are mild to warm. During the winter months (April to September) the days are usually bright, sunny and almost cloudless, being frequently almost as warm as in summer, while the nights are cold with frequent frost and haze or fog. The rainfall is greatest in the east, Woodbush in the north-east (Zoutpansberg District) having an average of 71·98 inches in 132 days; it decreases rapidly, however, westward from the escarpment falling to about 18 inches in the extreme south-west of the Province. The mean annual temperature shows considerable variation according to position and altitude; thus, Volkkrust in the south-east, near the Natal border, at an elevation of 5,300 feet, has an annual temperature of 56·9 deg., whilst Komati Poort, bordering Portuguese East Africa, at a height of only 460 feet above sea level, has an average temperature of 73·2 deg. Pretoria, the administrative capital, has an annual average temperature of 63·5 deg., with a rainfall of 29·46 inches; the warmest days there occur in December, when the mean maximum is 84·0 deg., whereas the coldest nights are met with during July, when the mean minimum is 34·8 deg. The warmest month, however, is January, with a mean
of 71·7 deg., and the coldest July, with 51·7 deg. The town of Johannesburg has a mean yearly temperature of 59·9 deg., with an average rainfall of 30·45 inches. Although the mean warmest month there is also January (67·5 deg.), the warmest days occur in December, when the mean maximum is 79·4 deg., and the coldest nights in July, when the mean minimum is 37·3 deg., and the monthly temperature 49·5 deg. Duststorms are frequent during the latter part of August and throughout September. Thunderstorms also are frequent during summer, more particularly from November to January, and destructive hailstorms are apt to occur at this season, destroying trees and crops. Strong, biting, cold, southerly winds blow from time to time during the winter, although the prevalent winds are mostly northerly.

Orange Free State Province.

The Orange Free State can be separated, roughly, into three divisions, viz., the Western, the Middle and the Eastern.

The Western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile. Rainfall averages 15 to 20 inches.

The Middle division, through which the main line railway runs, holds moisture longer than the Western division. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock. Rainfall averages 20 to 25 inches.

The Eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe. Rainfall averages 25 to 30 inches.

The heat, especially in the Middle and Western divisions, is great during the months of December, January and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein (altitude 4,510 feet above the sea) has risen on individual days to 102 deg. Fahr. at noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 74·2 deg. and the mean minimum 47·8 deg.

The Eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein:—January, 3·70 inches; February, 3·37; March, 3·56; April, 1·81; May, 1·10; June, 0·39; July, 0·33; August, 0·49; September, 0·86; October, 1·59; November, 2·12; December, 2·26. Total 21·58 inches.

Vital Statistics.

As the registration of births and deaths amongst the non-European population is imperfect, the birth and death rates cannot be calculated accurately.

The following are the figures for 1925 in regard to Europeans in the Union and the several Provinces:

| Province | Birth Rate | Death Rate |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Cape     | 26·68      | 10·04      |
| Natal    | 22·64      | 9·88       |
| Transvaal| 27·46      | 8·78       |
| O.F.S.   | 26·12      | 8·58       |
| Union    | 26·51      | 9·39       |

In 1925, the European marriage rates for the Union and Provinces were:—Union, 8·55 per 1,000; Cape of Good Hope, 8·31 per 1,000; Natal, 8·38 per 1,000; Transvaal, 8·93 per 1,000; and Orange Free State, 8·36 per 1,000.

Railways and Harbours.

During 1925, 4,948 vessels of 13,852,593 tons net entered the harbours of the Union.

Prior to Union, which took effect in May, 1910, the state railways of the several colonies now comprising the Union were operated by the separate Governments. In May, 1910, the Government lines were merged into one system, the South African Railways, under the control of the Union Government. The total open mileage of this system at 31st March, 1926, was 12,002 miles (comprising Cape 4,836, Orange Free State 1,489, Transvaal 2,947, Natal 1,378, and South-West Africa 1,352), of which 11,017 miles are 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, and 985 miles 2 ft. gauge.

The capital expenditure on Government railways up to 31st March, 1926, amounted to 125,083,377L.

The gross earnings for 1925-26 were 24,151,407L, and the net profit after payment of interest 1,083,999L.

Working expenditure (including renewals), amounted to 18,736,325L., or 77·58 per cent. of the gross revenue, as compared with 16,858,571L., or 77·52 per cent. of the gross revenue in the preceding year. In 1922, 1924, 1925 and 1926, Railway Construction Acts were passed authorising the construction of 1,937 miles of new railway; 510 miles had been completed and opened for traffic by 31st March, 1925, 828 miles by 31st March, 1926, and 969 miles by 31st August, 1926. Of the balance of 978 miles, active construction work is in progress on lines aggregating 329½ miles and a further 94 miles will be commenced before 31st March, 1927. The remaining lines will follow in due course. In August, 1925, the Administration acquired the 206 miles of railway between Worcester and Fore Bay Junction, formerly owned by the New Cape Central Railway Company.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Table Bay (Cape Town), Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. All Union ports are under direct control of the Department of Railways and Harbours.

Table Bay.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater 3,640 feet long and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 67 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 75½ acres, with about 2½ miles of berthing, and a depth ranging from 20 to 38 feet at low water. The normal capacity of the Docks is 8,000 tons per diem. There is also a graving dock of 500 feet capacity on the keel blocks with a depth of 25 feet over the sill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T. and a slip is available for vessels up to 500 tons, also a floating dock with a lifting capacity of 450 tons.

The following harbour extension works have been authorised and are in hand:—

(1) Extension of the Breakwater by 1,500 feet to shelter entrance to new basin.
(2) Widening of the South Arm to a width of 700 feet providing for quays equipped with modern electric cranes and four double-storey sheds, together with adequate railway siding accommodation.

(3) A protecting randan block mole to the southward of the widened South Arm which will enclose a new basin of 196 acres.

The port is also equipped with a grain elevator of 30,000 tons capacity and loading facilities to the quay adjacent there, also cold storage accommodation on one of the principal quays, etc., capacity 4,728 shipping tons. This installation is most up-to-date in that it embodies the latest improvements in refrigeration.

Port Elizabeth.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,160 feet and 1,204 feet respectively long, and a third jetty, 1,460 feet long.

There is also a slipway capable of carrying vessels of 400 tons dead weight drawing 9 feet 3 inches to 14 feet 7 inches at H.W.O.S.T.

The existing capacity of the Port so far as safe anchorage is concerned is very large, and is limited only by the available appliances for landing and shipping. These can handle approximately 6,000 tons of cargo per diem.

A scheme has been approved by Government for the provision of large sheltering works. The proposal involves the construction of a solid breakwater extending in continuation of the Dom Pedro Jetty for about 3,000 feet in an easterly direction, when it changes its course to a northerly direction for about another 5,000 feet.

This breakwater will shelter the anchorage up to a depth of 6½ fathoms.

The estimated cost of this proposed breakwater is £1,500,000. Up to 30th September, 1926, 2,210 feet length of breakwater wall has been constructed and the work is still in progress.

East London.

The port of East London is situated at the mouth of the Buffalo River, the entrance being protected by solid breakwaters on both sides. The South Breakwater extends beyond the North Breakwater to the extent of 750 feet with a width between them of 700 feet.

The old Eastern Pier is in course of demolition and on completion of this work there will be a width of 500 feet between the banks of the river inside the entrance, thus greatly facilitating navigation.

The Harbour area is 100 acres in extent. Vessels drawing up to 25 feet and of a tonnage of 9,000 tons gross register can enter the river and discharge alongside the quays, the total length of which amounts to 3,000 feet of deep water berthing with depths of from 27 feet 9 inches to 32 feet L.W.O.S.T. and 2,000 feet of lesser depth suitable for berthing smaller vessels.

A patent slip provides every facility for slapping and effecting repairs to vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight.

Durban.

Durban harbour is accessible at all times to the largest vessels navigating southern waters.

The harbour is approached through the Bluff Channel, 4,000 feet in length, formed by a north pier and a south breakwater. The width and depth of channel vary, but nowhere is there a less width than 400 feet and there is an average working depth of 32 feet at L.W.O.S.T. The average working depth at the entrance is 37 feet at L.W.O.S.T. The land-locked bay inside these piers extends about 3¼ miles east and west, and nearly two miles north and south. The wharves have a length of 2¾ miles, with depths alongside of from 23 feet to 38 feet 6 inches L.W.O.S.T. The deep-water space available for shipping covers about one-ninth of the area, and gives a low-water depth of not less than 30 feet over its greater part.

There is a floating dock of the following dimensions:

- Length over platform .. 475 feet.
- Breadth .. .. .. 60 "
- Draught over keel block .. 23 "
- Lifting capacity .. .. 6,500 tons.

The Prince Edward Graving Dock was opened in June, 1925. The dock may be divided into two compartments, the inner 460 feet in length and the outer 660 feet. Extreme length 1,166 feet 4 inches. Length on keel blocks, 1,150 feet (in case of emergency the length can be increased to 1,191 feet); width at entrance, 110 feet; width at coping, 138 feet 6 ins.; width at floor, 110 feet; depth on sill, H.W.O.S.T., 41 feet, L.W.O.S.T., 35 feet; spring tide rise, 6 feet; coping above L.W.O.S.T., 12 feet; floor of outer end (below L.W.O.S.T.), 40 feet; rise of floor, 1 in 660.

Sea and Land Communications.

The mail steamers of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Union Government, leave England and the Union (Table Bay) weekly on Fridays, the passage to be effected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 6 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena and Ascension. The calls at St. Helena and Ascension however are made by the Intermediate steamers under agreement with the British Post Office. The distance by sea from England to the Union varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail steamers call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly on Tuesdays for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London to land and embark passengers, while a frequent service to Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban, is also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five. From Natal the mail steamers leave weekly, calling at East London, Port Elizabeth (the call at Mossel Bay is fortnightly) and Cape Town. The Union-Castle Company also has a service via the Eastern route (through the Suez Canal), both outwards and homewards.

A frequent service to Australia is maintained by the steamers of the Aberdeen Line, White Star Line, Blue Funnel and P. & O. Branch Service Lines.

There is a mail Service with Mauritius and East Coast Ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.), once or twice a month and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. There are also two direct lines of Steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is 26 days.

Passenger train services afford communication between all the principal towns in the Union several times each week; with Rhodesia four times a week, and with Lourenço Marques four times a week. Mail trains depart from Cape
Town daily, except Mondays and Fridays, at 4 p.m. for the North and at 9.00 p.m. daily, except Fridays, for Eastern portions of Cape Province, Orange Free State, Transvaal and Natal. Return trains depart from Pretoria at 7.55 p.m., and Johannesburg at 10.00 p.m., daily, except Sundays and Thursdays, for Cape Town via Kimberley, and daily, except Saturdays, via Orange Free State, from Johannesburg at 7.45 p.m. (Pretoria, 6.30 p.m.), arriving at Cape Town on the third morning and afternoon respectively. Fast limited express trains, conveying first class passengers, are run twice weekly, leaving Cape Town 10.45 a.m. on Mondays and Fridays, arriving at Johannesburg 4.30 p.m. Tuesdays and Saturdays (Pretoria 6.25 p.m.), and leaving Johannesburg 9.50 a.m. Sundays and Thursdays (Pretoria 8.15 a.m.), arriving Cape Town 2.13 p.m. Mondays and Fridays. The train from Cape Town on Mondays connects with the incoming European mail steamer, and the train from Johannesburg on Thursdays connects with the outgoing mail steamer from Cape Town at 4 p.m. on Fridays. The trains are specially fitted throughout to ensure the comfort of passengers and are very popular with travellers.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays a train departs from Cape Town at 4.00 p.m. for Rhodesia. Connection from Transvaal is made at Mafeking by 8.00 p.m. train from Johannesburg on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Bulawayo is reached at 8.15 a.m. on Thursdays, Saturdays, Mondays and Tuesdays from which station connecting trains are run to Victoria Falls, the Congo, Salisbury and Beira. In the opposite direction trains depart from Bulawayo at 5.00 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays and are due to arrive at Johannesburg at 8.34 a.m., Pretoria at 8.32 a.m., on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, Mondays, and Cape Town at 6.30 a.m. on Thursdays, Fridays, Sundays, Tuesdays.

A train conveying the European mails brought by the incoming mail steamer is despatched from the docks Cape Town to all parts of South Africa. Mail trains depart from Durban at 2.15 p.m. and 5.40 p.m. daily for Johannesburg and Pretoria. In the return direction trains depart from Johannesburg at 9.15 a.m. and 8.45 p.m. daily for Durban.

Posts and Telegraphs.

At the end of March, 1926, there were in the Union 3,016 post offices, and 2,585 telegraph offices. During the year 279,714,000 articles of mail matter were posted addressed to places within and without the Union. 2,660,000 of the articles posted were registered; 5,905,000 telegrams of all classes were forwarded; there were approximately 129,229,000 telephone calls. The number of money orders issued was 487,526 of a total value of £573,830l., while the number paid was 445,802 of a total value of £303,642l. Postal orders issued numbered 4,021,617 amounting to £145,706l. in value, and the number paid was 3,428,778, valued at £1,787,387l.

The revenue in respect of the postal service during 1925-26 amounted to £1,892,063l., and the telegraph and telephone revenue was £1,646,091l. The total expenditure in respect of postal, telegraph and telephone services during 1925-26 amounted to £2,788,369l.

36,907 miles of telegraph wire, and 271,609 miles of telephone wire were in use; there were 74,564 telephone instruments and 55,996 subscribers.

The number of depositors in the Government Savings Bank at 31st March, 1926, was 332,166, and the total amount standing to their credit £6,386,751l.

The Union is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent by the Western route, and via Zanzibar and Aden by the Eastern route, and with Australia, India and the Far East, via Mauritius and Cocos.

Wireless Installations have been established at Cape Town, Durban (Port Natal) and Port Elizabeth. A short range wireless station has also been established at East London. The Cape Town and Durban stations have an effective daylight range of 1,000 miles, and the Port Elizabeth station of 300 miles; these distances are considerably exceeded in night operations, which have been successfully carried out over more than 2,000 miles at Cape Town and Durban and 1,000 miles at Port Elizabeth.

Customs and Excise.

The four self-governing colonies prior to the operation of the Act of Union gave notice to the Administrations of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia of their intention to retire from the South African Customs Union Convention in terms of Article xxiii. of that Convention, with effect from 30th June, 1910; and subsequently, on the consummation of the Union of South Africa, an agreement was concluded with these Administrations to continue all the essential features of the previous Customs Convention, which agreement has been subsequently amended to permit of freedom of charges for excise. A new agreement was entered into as from the 1st January, 1925, which provided for

(a) The free interchange of the produce and manufactures of the Provinces of the Union, and the Territories of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, excepting any goods upon which either Government imposes any excise duties.

(b) The payment to the Administrations of a sum equal to (i) twelve per centum of the values originally entered for customs purposes on imported goods removed thereto ex open stocks and (ii) six per centum of the export value of goods manufactured in the Union and removed thereto: Provided that the payment on goods removed to Southern Rhodesia shall not be less than £125,000l. per annum and to Northern Rhodesia not less than £12,500l. per annum.

(c) The collection for and payment to the Administrations of the excise duties on Union products, other than potable spirits which are collected by the Administration as a customs duty, intended for consumption in the Territories and vice versa.

(d) The prohibition of the importation of (i) beef or cattle below a certain weight and (ii) scrap tobacco, dust tobacco and tobacco stems and tobacco in any form manufactured therefrom.
The Agreement is for periods of 12 months ending 30th June of each year subject to six months' notice by either party of its intention to retire therefrom as from the 30th June following such notice. If, however, either party take steps in conflict with the spirit and intent of the Agreement, the other is at liberty to retire forthwith.

For like reasons, a Customs Agreement has been entered into between the Government of the Union and His Majesty's High Commissioner on behalf of the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland. The agreement is somewhat similar to that referred to above, but the basis laid down in Section No. 12 of the South Africa Act, 1909, for the adjustment of duties between the parties to the Agreement is followed, viz.:—The Treasury of the Union will pay out quarterly a sum in respect of such duties which shall bear to the total Customs revenue of the Union in each year the same proportion as the average amount of the Customs revenue of such Territories for the three completed financial years last preceding the taking effect of the South Africa Act 1909. The percentage so arrived at is applicable to both Customs and excise duties, other than the excise duties on spirits and beer, which are collected by the Territories themselves.

A uniform rate of excise duty now applies throughout the Union on spirits distilled, or beer brewed, within the Union, except in the case of spirits distilled from the products of the sugar-cane, on which, when removed for consumption outside Natal, an additional excise duty is levied.

A rebate of the whole excise duty is granted on methylated spirits, on spirits used in the fortification of pure wine, or in the manufacture of motor-fuel, and on spirits exported, and a rebate of part duty on plain spirits used in any art or manufacture.

An excise duty is also levied throughout the Union on acetic and pyroligneous acids, extracts and essences of vinegar, matches, playing cards, sugar and cigarette tobacco.

Excise is levied by means of stamps on cigarettes manufactured in the Union, or in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland, when entered for consumption in the Union, or in these Territories, and an equivalent surtax is levied on imported cigarettes, whether from overseas or from Southern or Northern Rhodesia.

The principle of granting a rebate of Customs duties on all goods the growth, produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom has been abandoned and under the new Customs Tariff Act of 1925 a preferential rebate is granted on certain specified articles only. The same applies to Canada and New Zealand.

Rebates of duty are granted on numerous articles which are essential to certain specified industries.

All duties are rebated on goods in transit through any part of the Union to places outside the Union.

The duty paid on bona fide samples of commercial travellers is refunded if the samples are exported within twelve months from the date of importation.

A refund of the duty originally paid will be made on all articles not intended for consumption in the Union imported by bona fide tourists for their use while in the Union provided such articles are exported within six months from the date of importation. As regards tourists' motor cars the triptyque system is in vogue.

A rebate of Customs duty will be allowed on used household effects the bona fide property of settlers to the value of one hundred pounds for each adult and fifty pounds for each child but not exceeding four hundred in all for each family.

Money, Weights and Measures.

Coinage.—A Coinage Act passed in 1922 provided for the minting of Union coins with the same denominations and relative values as those of Great Britain.

Weights and Measures.—The Weights and Measures Act, 1922, which was to come into effect early in 1923, makes provision for the standardization of the metric system of weights and measures, with the optional use of imperial standards in defined cases.

The following old Dutch measures are still used:

Liquid Measure: Leesger—about 129 imperial gallons; half aum=154 imperial gallons; anker=7½ imperial gallons. Capacity: muid=3 bushels. The general surface measure is Morgen, equal to 2½ acres; 1,000 Cape lineal feet are equal to 1,033 British imperial feet.

Land Administration.

Union of South Africa.

The Land Settlement Act (No. 12 of 1912), as amended by Act No. 23 of 1917, 28 of 1920, 21 of 1922, 38 of 1924 and 26 of 1925, provides inter alia, for the purchase by government of private farms for persons able to pay not less than one-tenth of the purchase price of such farms in cash, the remainder of the purchase price including inspection, survey and transfer costs (if any) and an amount representing 4 per cent. for the first and second years, being repayable in seventy-six equal half-yearly instalments, including capital and interest calculated from the date of purchase at the rate of four per cent. per annum. No instalments are payable during the first and second years of the lease. The Act also provides for the disposal of Crown land, and any land the government may under this Act acquire from private persons, on lease for five years with option of purchase to approved applicants. One important condition of the allotment is that of continuous personal occupation of the land by the lessee. Advances may be made to lessees for the purchase of stock, implements, seeds and other things necessary for the development and working of the holding, but such advances must not exceed 500L. The Minister of Lands, on the recommendation of a Land Board, may cause boring operations to be effected or improvements of a substantial and permanent nature to be constructed and add the cost thereof to the valuation of the holding.

The Act lays down the qualifications of intending lessees, and prescribes that they must possess capital sufficient for beneficially developing and working the holdings applied for.

Not less than ten years after the date of commencement of a lease, a lessee is entitled to a Crown grant of his own holding, provided the purchase price has been paid and the provisions of the Act have been complied with.

In special cases the 10 year period may be waived and the 1922 Act provides that if after 5 years the holding has been sufficiently enhanced Crown grant can be issued and a mortgage bond passed for the residue of the purchase price and any sums owing for advances.

Geological Survey.

The geological survey of the Transvaal, together with what was formerly the Cape geological commission, have been incorporated together as the geological survey of the Union of South Africa, under the direction of A. W. Rogers, Sc.D.

The publications consist of annual reports, memoirs, and maps.

Forests.

The total area reserved for forest purposes in the Union of South Africa in March, 1926, was approximately 2,668,000 acres. The timbered area of the reserves is approximately 900,000 acres, of which some 138,905 acres consist of
plantations. The Union is divided into six conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests, stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knyana, Umtata, Pretoria, and Maritzburg respectively, who is responsible to the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Union at Pretoria. The policy of the Forest Department is to conserve and utilise to the best advantage the indigenous forests, and to add to the forest resources of the country by the afforestation of about 10,000 acres per annum. Expenditure on forests, including Railway Sleeper Plantations, for financial year 1925-26, £77,259, and the total revenue £15,698. Timber production on forest estate during 1925-26, aggregated 2,084,706 cubic feet.

Instruction.

In the South Africa Act, Section 85 (iii), it is provided that "Education, other than higher education, for a period of five years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides," shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the respective Provincial Councils. For practical purposes it has been provisionally determined that all post matriculation instruction shall be deemed to constitute higher education.

The Department of Education, under the Minister, was thereby placed in control of:

(1) The University of the Cape of Good Hope, Capetown, established in 1873. It was empowered to grant degrees, but it had no attached teaching institutions.
(2) The South African College, Capetown, founded in 1829.
(3) Victoria College, Stellenbosch, incorporated in 1881.
(4) Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, incorporated in 1904.
(5) Huguenot College, Wellington, incorporated in 1907.
(6) Grey University College, Bloemfontein, incorporated in 1910.
(7) Transvaal University College, Pretoria, incorporated in 1910.
(8) South African School of Mines, and Technology, Johannesburg, incorporated in 1910.
(9) Natal University College, Pietermaritzburg, incorporated in 1909. The department has also under its administration the training of first-class teachers.

In the session of 1916 three Acts were passed providing for the conversion of the South African College into the University of Capetown; of the Victoria College into the University of Stellenbosch; and of the University of the Cape of Good Hope into a Federal University with the remainder of the University Colleges as constituent Colleges. The last-named University to be styled the University of South Africa, with its seat at Pretoria. April 2nd, 1918, was fixed as the "appointed day," and on that date the new order of things came into force.

Subsequent enactments provided (1) for the conversion of the former S.A. School of Mines and Technology, Johannesburg (called the University College, Johannesburg, after 1916), into the University of the Witwatersrand, which was formally instituted on March 1st, 1922; and (2) for the creation of a University College at Potchefstroom, affiliated to the University of South Africa.

The total number of students at the various Colleges in December, 1925, was 5,570 and the State expenditure on higher education during 1925, was £42,710.

Provision is made on the vote of the department of a grant-in-aid to the South African Native College at Alice, Cape Province, an institution for the higher education of natives, which was formally opened in February, 1916, and at the end of the 1926 Session (December), had 95 students. The administration of the Children's Protection Act, 1913, and the Government Industrial Schools established thereunder has recently been transferred to this department.

Native Affairs.

The native population of the Union at the census of 1921 was as follows:—Cape of Good Hope, 1,840,162; Natal, 1,139,804; Transvaal, 1,495,869; Orange Free State, 421,978, making a total of 4,697,813, or 67·80 per cent. of the whole population. In the Cape Province the native population is centred in the native territories and a number of eastern districts, with Kingwilliamstown as the area with the densest native population. In Natal, about one-quarter of the native population is to be found in Zululand, while in the rest of the province the natives are distributed evenly throughout the various districts. In Zululand they are, however, less densely settled than in the remainder of Natal. In the Transvaal the bulk of the native population is contained in the Witwatersrand area, which is largely urban and has a high density, and in the northern portion of the province forming the greater part of the Bushveld. In the Orange Free State the natives are principally located in the central and eastern districts, adjoining the Basutoland border.

The South Africa Act preserves for the election of members of the House of Assembly the franchise laws of the different colonies comprising the Union, as they existed on the 31st May, 1910. In the Cape Province no distinction was made between European and native, and the names of a large number of natives who are qualified in respect of property or salary, as well as educationally, are included in the electoral rolls. In Natal, natives are only entitled to become parliamentary voters with the specific authority of the Governor-General. The number so authorized at the present time is negligible. There is no provision for the direct representation of the natives of the Transvaal and Orange Free State Provinces in the House of Assembly. In the Senate provision is made under the constitution for the inclusion of four members nominated by the Governor-General who "shall be selected on the ground mainly of their thorough acquaintance, by reason of their official experience or otherwise with the reasonable wants and wishes of the coloured races in South Africa."

The Native Affairs Act of 1920 established the Native Affairs Commission, which is an advisory body consisting of not less than three or more than five members, appointed by the Governor-General and presided over by the Minister of Native Affairs. The Act also revived for the Union the obsolete provision of the Transvaal Law for the summoning of conferences of native persons and bodies representative of native opinion, with the object of enabling the Government to gauge more accurately the state of native thought and feeling and of affording to those not otherwise represented, the opportunity of expressing their views.

The control and administration of native affairs throughout the Union are vested in the Governor-General-in-Council, who is authorized to exercise all special powers in regard to native administration vested at the time in the Governors of the Colonies entering the Union, or exercised by other authorities as superior chiefs. The executive authority rests with a Minister of Native Affairs,
who is in control of a department of state under a permanent Secretary for Native Affairs with an under-secretary and staff. In all four provinces of the Union there are native chiefs and headmen, many of whom are subsidized by the Government. Their powers, duties and jurisdiction vary in different parts of the country. All serve under district officials and are in charge of tribes and locations, as the case may be.

Local government of natives is established under the following bodies:—The Glen Grey District Council, the Transkeian Territories General Council, the Pondoland General Council, the Eastern Pondoland Trust Fund, Orange Free State Native Reserves, and Mission Stations and Communal Reserves. The Native Affairs Act of 1920 provides for the establishment of local councils in native areas which have been set aside or may hereafter be set aside as such by Parliament. Apart from such native areas, the local government and control of natives rests with the various municipal and other local government bodies.

The tenure of land by natives is regulated by the Native Land Act of 1913, which was avowedly a temporary measure with the object of maintaining the status quo as regards the ownership and occupation of land in the Union relatively by natives and by persons other than natives—so far as that could be done without imposing undue hardship "until Parliament should make other provision." In 1917, the further legislation contemplated in the Act was introduced into Parliament in the shape of the Native Affairs Administration Bill, which has not, however, passed into law.

Various considerations led the Government to the conclusion that the time was not yet ripe for passing definite segregation legislation, which is the objective of the South African Government's native affairs policy, and the Native Affairs Act of 1920 was passed merely as a preliminary step in that direction. Pending the enactment of further legislation on the native land question, the Government has not hesitated to supply by administrative action indispensable requirements which it was originally intended should be met by the legislation foreshadowed in the Natives Land Act.

Applications for permits to prospect in native areas are not encouraged. Several native locations in the Cape Province have been proclaimed as areas within which prospecting is not allowed. In the Transvaal permission to prospect in locations can only be obtained with the approval of the Minister of Native Affairs and since the discovery of platinum in the province, a limited number of permits have been issued having regard to the undesirability, from an economic point of view, of locking up what might prove to be assets of national importance.

All state and state-aided native education in the Union, with the exception of that represented by the South African Native College, is controlled by the provincial administrations in terms of the South Africa Act. Native education, other than state and state-aided education, is under the control of missionary societies.

There are numerous institutions in the Union which endeavour to provide for the needs of the native peoples in regard to higher education, i.e., education beyond Standard IV, including industrial, agricultural, and commercial education, preparation for religious ministry, and the teaching profession. By far the most important of these is the South African Native College, which was established in 1914, and has rendered inestimable service in the cause of native education. In 1923, it was declared to be "a place of higher education" under Act No. 30 of 1923. As a result of this development, the college became eligible for the receipt of grants in aid of higher education under the Act.

There are about one hundred and thirty native separatist churches, and the tendency is for the number to increase rapidly. The Select Committee of the House of Assembly on Native Affairs in 1925 recommended that, with regard to applications by churches or religious bodies for sites or other privileges depending upon Government recognition, as a general rule permission should only be granted to churches long established and enjoying universal public recognition, and, in all other cases before any application is considered by the Native Affairs Department a report should be submitted by the Native Affairs Commission in regard to the applicant body as to the demand for its existence, its stability, its capacity both financially and educationally, and the general fitness for religious work amongst natives. The recommendation was adopted and now forms the basis for administration in connection with the separate churches.

Before the establishment of the Union the control and administration of matters affecting natives in urban areas were vested in the local authorities having jurisdiction. Since 1910, the Native Affairs Department has been concerned with the oversight of all regulations submitted by local authorities for approval, and with the preparation of legislation affecting natives. The conditions prevailing in the urban native locations in all the provinces have been far from satisfactory. In the Cape of Good Hope, under the Public Health Act of 1897, local bodies are entitled to exercise supervision over native locations and to secure punishment of breaches of regulations, but no duty is cast upon them by law to see that proper provision is made for the native population. The Native Affairs Department has, however, been in a position by virtue of its indirect control, to impose this obligation on the local authorities and to enforce its fulfillment to a certain extent. In the urban areas of Natal, with the exception of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, although local authorities have the power to lay out locations and compel the residence of natives therein, the location system is untried. The native population of the town squats on the town lands, and is subject to a minimum of control. In the Transvaal, regulations for the control of locations have been framed and contain provisions in regard to public health matters, but no power exists for compelling the local authorities to carry out their share of the necessary reforms. In the Orange Free State the powers granted to local authorities in respect of the control of coloured persons (here including natives) are very wide, but are directed rather to the preservation of status than to the amelioration of the condition of the natives.

Union legislation in regard to natives in urban areas has been under consideration since 1912, but it was not until 1923 that the Natives (Urban areas) Act was passed. The act provides for improved conditions of residence for natives in or near urban areas and defines and describes the powers and duties of urban local authorities in respect of the native population within their areas. A system of Pass Laws is in force throughout the Union, with the exception of the
Cape Province. Letters of exemption, however, are issued to natives with certain qualifications in Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.

The principal sources of native revenue in the various provinces have been as follows:—Cape Province, hut tax, quitrent, and private location fees; Natal, hut tax and rent levied in respect of native huts on crown lands as distinct from locations; Transvaal, poll tax and rent from natives squatting on crown lands as distinct from locations; Orange Free State, poll tax. These different systems of taxation were abrogated by the Native Taxation and Development Act, 1923, which substituted a uniform system throughout the Union. Under that Act every adult male native is liable annually for a general tax of £1, and in addition every native occupier of a hut or dwelling in a native location, unless he be the holder of a quitrent allotment, is liable for a local tax of 10s. per annum. One fifth of the general tax and the whole of the local tax are to be used for the direct benefit, educationally or otherwise, of the natives. The former charges in respect of the occupation of land, i.e., rents, etc., remain. No direct taxation can be imposed on natives by any body other than the Union Government.

The regulation of native labour employed by large industrial undertakings—a matter of fundamental economic importance to South Africa—is governed by an act of 1911, which consolidated the laws in force in the various provinces with regard to the recruiting and employment of native labour. The law provides for the appointment of a director of native labour, the issue of licences to employers and agents to recruit natives, and to compound managers, and the assessment of compensation for injuries contracted during service. The average number of natives employed in Transvaal labour districts, including mines and works, in December, 1923, was 303,230. Owing to special measures adopted and improved conditions of work, there has been a steady decline in the death rates of native labourers and an improvement in health generally during the last few years.

Cape: The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amassos was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs and others living along the Orange River took up arms against the colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate with a body of police was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up and the special commissioner recalled on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now part of the Cape Province.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve and Noman's Land were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gealekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-63, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then commandant of the frontier armed and mounted police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-6 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gealekaland, and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland and Gealekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885, the chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the chief of the Bomvanas. Palir, chief of the Amethazi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pondoimbi tribe, under the chiefs Umditshwa and Umbhlonho, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The port at the St. John's River mouth was annexed to the Colony in 1884, and Customs dues are now levied there under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881.

By Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigau and Ngwiliro to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the chief Ngwiliro. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for 1,000l.

The District of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now within the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and are grouped under one Chief Magistrate, who is stationed at Umtata, while there are 27 subordinate magistrates. Griqualand East with a population of 6,245 Europeans, 253,601 Bantu, 4,981 mixed, has eight magistrates; Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, with a population of 4,204 Europeans, 228,512 Bantu, 1,849 mixed, has six magistrates; Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the
Idutywa Reserve, Goalekaland, with population of 2,292 Europeans, 195,410 Bantu, 393 mixed, has six magistrates; Pondoland, comprising East and West Pondoland and Port St. John's, with a population of 1,512 Europeans, 261,467 Bantu, 1,925 mixed, has seven magistrates.

Natal and Zululand.—In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was despatched against the tribe and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "Native Law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch law and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters; a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime, Mala in se. This system of Government remains in operation at the present time, under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11, of 1865; but at the same time and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may, in certain cases, apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A Law No. 26 of 1875, established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts.

As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work so well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875, the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903, to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust for occupation by natives is about 2,400,000 acres, the land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

Defence.

The South Africa Defence Act, 1912, which became law on the 14th June, 1912, as amended by the South Africa Defence Act Amendment Act, of 1922, provides for the establishment of Defence Forces, comprising:

1. The South African Permanent Force, which consists of:
   (i) The South African Staff Corps.
   (ii) The South African Field Artillery.
   (iii) The South African Air Force.
   (iv) The South African Permanent Garrison Artillery.
   (v) The South African Naval Service.
   (vi) The South African Instructional Corps.
   (vii) The South African Engineer Corps.
   (viii) The South African Ordnance Corps.
   (ix) The South African Service Corps.
   (x) The South African Medical Corps.
   (xi) The South African Veterinary Corps.
   (xii) The South African Administrative, Pay, and Clerical Corps.

The South African Naval Service includes the officers and men of the South African Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve engaged for whole-time service.

2. The Coast Garrison Force.
3. The Citizen Force.
4. The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.
5. Special Reserves.

Every citizen between the ages of 17 and 60 is liable to render personal service in time of war and those between 17 and 25 are liable to undergo a prescribed peace training with the Active Citizen Force spread over a period of four consecutive years. The Act states, however, that only 50 per cent. of the total number liable to peace training shall actually undergo that training unless Parliament makes financial provision for the training of a greater number.

The establishment of Rifle Associations is a marked feature of the Act; citizens between the ages of 21 and 25 who are not entered for peace training with the Active Citizen Force are to be required to undergo training during these four years in a Rifle Association, thus ensuring that, in course of time, all citizens will at least know how to handle and use a rifle. As an alternative, citizens may enter for service in the South African Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.

Provision is also made in the Act for the cadet training of boys between 13 and 17 in urban and other populous areas where facilities can conveniently be arranged.

The Union is divided into 6 military districts. To each military district has been allotted various units of different arms, to which the citizens entered for peace training in their 20th and 21st years are posted.

The object of the Amending Act is to provide for a small standing army with an efficient Air Force and the nucleus of a Naval Service for coastal defence.
Under the Act the Permanent Force is relieved of all Police duties in peace time for which they were liable under the Act of 1912, and becomes a purely military force.

The provision of a Police Reserve to take the place of the South African Mounted Riflemen, when on active service, is no longer necessary, and has been expunged from the Act of 1912 accordingly.
