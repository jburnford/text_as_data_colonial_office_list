JAMAICA.

with 73,506 pupils in average attendance, and the grant-in-aid for 1925 was £117,461.; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for women teachers which is mainly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Micc undenominational training college for men, and two denominational colleges for women teachers. By an Act passed in 1892 a Board of Education was constituted. The District School Boards manage government schools, some of which are held in government buildings, others in rented buildings.

A provision was made in 1892 for the opening of government secondary schools where required; there are sixteen secondary schools receiving aid from public funds under regulations for grants in aid. Secondary education is provided for in part by endowed schools, under local governments controlled by the Jamaica Schools Commission, and a number of private schools. A beginning has been made in providing from public funds for technical education. There are university scholarships (one for girls) tenable at English universities or elsewhere within the British Empire. One Rhodes Scholarship is annually awarded in Jamaica. The following examinations are held:—London University, Cambridge Locals, Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board, Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, Royal Drawing Society.

The Institute of Jamaica (in Kingston) is a Public Library with 24,500 books, of which 6,500 form the West India Reference Library; a Natural History Museum, with a small collection of live animals; and a Jamaica History Gallery.

Industry.

Fruit, consisting of bananas, oranges, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges being 106,392 boxes, with a value of £53,125; and that of bananas being 15,017,422 stems, with a value of £1,510,625.

These figures represent the exports, there being no record of quantities consumed in the Island.

The area under sugar cane in 1925-26 was 44,086 acres, and under coffee 17,860. There are 15,000 acres of Government cinchona plantations. Area under banana cultivation, 71,398 acres.

The large coffee plantations are mainly on the Blue Mountain Range. Comparatively few of the large plantations remain however, and the great bulk of the coffee exported is grown by small landowners on the limestone formation, which is the principal geological area. The great fruit growing districts are in St. Mary, with Port Maria, Annotto Bay, Portland with Port Antonio, and St. Catherine, with Kingston for its outlet. Sugar is largely grown in Westmoreland and in the district of Vere Clarendon parish, and in the seaward parts of St. James and Trelawney, where the best rum in the world is produced. The cattle-raising districts are in St. Ann's, and in Hanover and Westmoreland and the western part of St. James. The uplands of Manchester parish are rich in coffee and fruit. St. Elizabeth parish grows a large quantity of logwood and other dye woods, as well as maize and fine pasture for horses and cattle.

The cultivation of cotton has recently been undertaken. There are 61 acres now under cultivation.

The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, potable spirits and beer, building materials, oils, motor vehicles, cotton piece goods and cigarettes. Of the total trade of the island the greater portion is with the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada being next in importance.

The following are the figures for 1925:

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica via the United States. Messrs. Elder's and Fyffe's steamers sail frequently from Liverpool. The voyage takes 13 to 14 days. The Leyland Line Steamers (West India and Pacific Branch) leave Liverpool on the

10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. The two cables from Cuba touch at Jamaica, from which they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama. On 31st January, 1898, the Direct West India Cable Company established communication between Jamaica and Halifax via Bermuda and Turks Island.

Telegraph lines connect all the principal towns, and there are 143 telegraph and telephone stations. The total mileage open is 1,367—971 miles along roads, 186 miles P.O. lines on railway, and 210 along railway lines. The receipts in 1925 were £16,644.

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of Saint James, a distance of 112½ miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17½ miles; and to Port Antonio by a branch line from Bogwalk, on the Ewarton branch, of 54½ miles; and by a branch line from May Pen to Frankfield, 23½ miles; also from Linstead to New Works, 2½ miles. The total length of line open is 210 miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed, the Government resumed possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge for 1925-26, providing for interest and repayment, is £189,093. The receipts in 1925-26 were more than the expenditure by £51,582., leaving a deficiency of £137,535. There is also a line of telegraph and telephone along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 112½ miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 17½ miles; from Bogwalk to Port Antonio, 54½ miles; from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; and from Linstead to New Works 2½ miles.

The island is intersected by an extensive system of metalled and gravelled roads, suitable for motoring, the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum grades are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,266 miles of main roads, and about 4,366 miles of parochial roads.

The United Fruit Co. at present run a fortnightly coasting service by steamship, calling at the principal out-ports.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st March, 1925, no ships were built.
