BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is the western province of the Dominion of Canada, situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprising the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian to the 54th parallel, and the Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.

The length of the coast line in a direct line north and south, is 541 miles, but the total length, following the sinuosities of the coast, is 4,334 miles, exclusive of islands. The coastline of Vancouver Island is 1,884 miles, and the length 288 miles. The area (including Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Island) is about 355,856 square miles. The distinguishing physical features of British Columbia are the great mountain ranges which intersect the country in parallel lines, the general direction being north and south; the extensive plateaux of the central interior; the rich valleys which produce in abundance all kinds of agricultural produce; the vast forests of commercial timber; and the deeply indented seaboard. The population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173, 1901, 178,657, 1911, 392,480; 1921, 524,582.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1868, in consequence of the large immigration on the discovery of gold in the Thompson and Fraser Rivers. Vancouver Island was granted to the Hudson's Bay Company under certain conditions in 1849, and the same year it was made a Crown colony. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united under the former name, and on July 20th, 1871, British Columbia entered the Dominion of Canada as a Province. The Province is represented by six members in the Senate, and fourteen members in the House of Commons of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and an Executive Council, or Cabinet, of eight Ministers, members of the legislative assembly of 48 members, on the British system of ministerial responsibility. The House of Assembly is elected for five years, every male and female adult (British subjects) having resided
six months in the Province and duly registered, being entitled to a vote. In 1917 the franchise was extended to women. Members of the Legislature receive a sessional indemnity of $2,000, and a mileage allowance for travelling expenses.

Crown Land and Surveys.

The area of the Province of British Columbia is 227,747,200 acres. Of this area about 9,000,000 acres are crown granted, 2,000,000 granted to Railway Companies, 15,000,000 acres controlled by the Dominion Government, and about 1,600,000 acres in process of alienation. About 50,000,000 acres are estimated to be available for agricultural and grazing purposes. About 7,500,000 acres are held under timber licences or leases, 700,000 acres under grazing or coal leases, and 2,100,000 acres under parks and game reserves. A total of 22,510,903 acres of land have been surveyed, 8,945,119 acres of which are surveys of timber areas, and 466,117 acres of mineral claims. Approximately 2,000,000 acres of surveyed lands are available for free preemption. Geographic and land maps can be obtained on application to the Department of Lands; also maps, handbooks and descriptive matter from the Bureau of Provincial Information.

Agriculture.

Agriculture in British Columbia has progressed steadily during the past four years. Mixed farming, stockraising, dairying, fruit-growing, poultry raising, and truck-gardening are the principal sources of agricultural production in the Province. Preserving of fruit and vegetables has become quite an industry in the last year or two. The total value of farm products in 1925 was $65,153,000—live stock $18,256,000*; field crops $15,880,000*; poultry and eggs $4,746,000*; fruit and vegetables $13,074,000*; wool $93,000*; dairy products $10,630,000*; other $2,474,000.*

Mining Industry.

The total mineral production of British Columbia in 1925 amounted in value to $61,492,242,* towards which gold contributed $4,615,361*; silver $5,286,818*; coal and coke $12,168,905*; copper $10,153,269*; lead $18,670,329*; zinc $7,754,450.

Detailed reports are obtainable from the Bureau of Mines, Victoria.

Forest Wealth.

The stand of merchantable timber in the Province of British Columbia is estimated to reach the enormous total of four billion (400,000,000,000) feet board measure, which is over half the total of all Canada.

British Columbia occupies an especially advantageous position for supplying the overseas markets. It has vast quantities of timber unsurpassed in size, quality and suitability for the manufacture of all kinds of dimension timber, lumber, piling, railway ties, pulp, paper and other products. The principal export timber trees of British Columbia are Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Western Hemlock, and Sitka Spruce or Silver Spruce. The total production from British Columbia forests during 1925 was $81,941,000,* including sawn lumber to the value of $41,350,000,* shingles $10,000,000,* pulp and paper $14,466,000.*

Water Resources.

All the water in rivers and streams of the Province is in the right of the Crown and may be appropriated for various purposes under the rules and regulations of the Water Act. Of these purposes the most important is Power and Irrigation. In respect of the first mentioned, there is probably no area on the continent of America so favoured in water power resources. Large power sites are strategically situated so that in time many districts may be served with electrical energy by transmission lines of economic length. It is of interest to note that contiguous to Vancouver, the largest centre of population, within a radius of one hundred miles, there is available well over 750,000 horse power, of which over 150,000 is developed, while 250,000 horse power is developed on the Kootenay River near Nelson, and is supplying smelters at Trail and Grand Forks. In regard to irrigation, such is largely practiced south of the 51st parallel of latitude. Water has been recorded for upwards of 600,000 acres of lands, of which approximately 100,000 have been brought under cultivation. The fruit areas depend to considerable extent upon irrigation. The largest and one of the most important of these is the Okanagan Valley, which now has a well-established fruit and vegetable industry. Through co-operation in production and marketing, those areas dependent upon irrigation are becoming very attractive.

Fisheries.

The commercial fisheries of British Columbia are of considerable importance. Salmon, halibut, and herring are the principal food fishes, and cod, oolachans, pilchard, clams, oysters, shrimps, etc., are also produced in large quantities. The whale fisheries are also a not unimportant branch of the fishing industry.

Value of total production, 1925, $22,414,618.

Iron and Steel.

Large iron deposits, magnetite, limonite and hamatite, exist, with large metallic iron content and sufficiently free from impurities to be within the "Bessemer limit." Anticipations are that steel and iron will be developed in the near future.

Railways.

British Columbia has 4,117 miles of steam railway in operation (Dec. 31st, 1925). The Canadian Pacific Railway, the Canadian National Railways, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, are the main railways of the Province, with various branches of the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railways extending through the southern and south-western portions of the Province, and additional lines entering the Province from the United States.

Education.

A complete system of free and compulsory education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in municipal school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether cities of the first, second or third class, or district municipalities) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 71 high schools, with 10,597 scholars in the Province and 8 superior schools with 373 high school pupils. The number of school districts in operation is 759, with 71 high and 931 elementary schools, 3,115 classrooms, under 3,294 teachers. The total enrolment is 97,954. The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed is permitted to be taught. Schools are established wherever there are 10 children between the ages of 7 and 15 years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long. Its area is 1,397,980 acres, or 2,184 square miles; it is about 150 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of the inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census (1921) was 88,615.

Description.

The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous grain mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, etc. Many cheese and
butter factories have lately been established. The breeding and raising of silver and black foxes in captivity is an important industry, there being in 1925, 567 fox ranches in the province.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,347) and Summerside (3,228). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro' River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

Constitution.

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $500 per annum.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

Education

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, consisting of the Executive Council and the Chief Supt. of Education and the Principal of Prince of Wales College. The local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 7 and 13 years. There were in 1925, 472 schools, with 17,427 pupils. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic University not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens.

Finance.

There is a provincial tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also a road tax in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

Total Ordinary Revenue for the year ended 31st Dec., 1925 $762,115.
Total Expenditure, same year $764,773.
Dominion Subsidy $372,182 (included in above receipts).

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND
ALBERTA.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the terri-
tories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and
the North-Western Territory, were, with the excep-
tion of such portions thereof as form the Province
of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called
and known as the North-West Territories, and
were created into a Government entirely separate
and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was
put into force by Proclamation of 7th October,

1876. The Territories were governed by a
Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive
Council.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1905, the two
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were
formed out of the southern portion of the Terri-
tories, and were admitted into the Dominion as
such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing
line runs North and South being meridian 110
West of Greenwich.

SASKATCHEWAN.

Saskatchewan, called after the river of the
same name, meaning "rapid current," has an area
of 251,700 sq. miles, and a population in 1921 of
757,510 persons, an increase of 265,078 over that
of 1911. (Estimated population in 1925—
828,600.) It lies between 102°-110° West and
49°-60° North, with Manitoba on the East and
Alberta on the West. The Government consists
of a Lieut.-Governor, an Executive Council and
a representative Assembly of 63 members. The
Province is represented in the Dominion Parlia-
ment by 21 members in the House of Commons,
and 6 in the Senate. The seat of Govern-
ment is at Regina (named in honour of Queen
Victoria).

The remarks regarding the agricultural capa-
bilities of Manitoba apply to Saskatchewan. Free
grants of lands can still be had, although the
bulk of the land within convenient reach of the
railways has already been allotted. The agri-
cultural industry of the Province has made
phenomenal progress, and marked development is
seen in manufacturing spheres.
