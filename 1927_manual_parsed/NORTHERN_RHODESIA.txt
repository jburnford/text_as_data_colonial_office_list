NORTHERN RHODESIA.

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the Territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 237,950 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine magisterial districts for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Livingstone, situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls. Other important settlements are at Broken Hill, the centre of the mining industry, Fort Jameson, Lusaka, Mazabuka, Ndola near which the copper mines of Bwana Mkubwa are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery and Mongu-Lealui in Barotseland.

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer, with whose advent the authentic history of Northern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at the Zambesi near the place where the town bearing his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interception on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the great war with forces from German East Africa, and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey
ordered a general advance into German East Africa of the troops under his command, and by July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy. Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbeck doubled southwards, and on the 1st November made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier station, Fife. From there they proceeded southwest to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies for the forces operating on the border. The bulk of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the first news of the enemy's advance. After burning most of the buildings and their remaining contents, Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu motor-road, and early on the 13th November, his advanced parties opened fire on the British South Africa Company's rubber factory on the Chambesi River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice was received by the District Commissioner and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted the position and suspended hostilities. The number of individual Rhodesians (men and women) known to have undertaken duties in connection with the war was 7,009. Of these 6,859 served with H.M. Forces during the war, 469 being from Northern Rhodesia. 791 were killed in action or died of wounds or disease.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He relinquished office on the 20th September, 1923, and was succeeded by Mr. R. A. J. Goods as Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika District of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 26th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924 the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs and the Principal Medical Officer. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and five unofficial elected members. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, K.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District officers. The Barotse District is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied. The Civil jurisdiction of Native Commissioners' Courts is limited to causes or matters concerning natives. They also have criminal jurisdiction over natives with limitations. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from Native Commissioners' Courts to Magistrates, and from Magistrates' Courts to the High Court.

Population.

| European | Native |
|----------|--------|
|          |        |
| Censuses | Male | Female | Total | Male | Female | Total |
| 1911     | 1,121 | 376    | 1,497 | —    | —     | 831,163 |
| 1921     | 2,263 | 1,371  | 3,634 | 447,841 | 532,064 | 979,905 |

The European population at the 31st December, 1925, was returned as 4,624, comprising 2,211 adult males, 1,220 adult females and 1,193 children. The native population was estimated to be 1,140,642

Education.

European.—For the education of European children, there were, in 1926, Government Schools at Livingstone, Kalomo, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Broken Hill and Fort Jameson; Farm Schools at Silver Rest, Mulendema, Chiilongo and Lubombo; and a mine school at Bwana M'Kubwa. Primary education up to Standard VII is provided in these. Work has been commenced on a new boarding school for girls at Choma, which is considered to enjoy an especially healthy situation. On the completion of this, the present mixed boarding school at Kalomo will be closed, that at Mazabuka will be devoted exclusively to the education of boys, and the curriculum at both schools will be modified so that children proceeding further afield for secondary education will suffer no disadvantage by remaining in the territory up to Standard VII.
Native.—With the exception of the Barotse National School at Mongu which is under Government control, the actual education of the natives is in the hands of the Missionary Societies. A Director of Native Education has been appointed, and a system of Government Grants-in-aid to Missionary Societies who agree to conform to the general educational policy of the Government has been instituted. An Advisory Board in Native Education has been set up, upon which missionaries, settlers, and Government Departments are represented. A central agricultural research station at which native agricultural and veterinary demonstrators can be trained is under construction.

Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from $70^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ with a maximum of $103^\circ$ and a minimum of $56^\circ$. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from $55^\circ$ to $75^\circ$ with a maximum of $86^\circ$ and a minimum of $40^\circ$. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of $120^\circ$, whilst minima round about $30^\circ$ are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period July to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70% to 90% of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again. The average rainfall so far as present investigations shew is 37.5 inches per annum.

Commerce and Industries.

Farming and ranching occupy a considerable portion of the European inhabitants. Maize was, formerly, the chief crop and the demand for this is steadily increasing. The cultivation of cotton is being tested and the amount of tobacco grown is rapidly increasing. The export of tobacco has increased from 1¼ to 2½ million pounds during the past year. The variety grown is of exceptionally good quality and finds a ready market. Other crops are wheat, coffee, and citrus fruits. The increase in mining activities has caused a greater demand in the Territory and in the Belgian Congo for food stuffs of all varieties. The ranching industry is of considerable importance but is quite incapable of supplying the demands made upon it. As a consequence, many thousands of cattle pass through Northern Rhodesia from Southern Rhodesia and N'gamiland each year to supply the markets of the Belgian Congo. The estimated requirements of Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo, for slaughter cattle, is 40,000 head per annum. The dairying industry is small and is capable of great increase. The greater portion of the total amount of butter used in the Territory is imported. There is now under erection a central agricultural research and demonstration station where plant breeding, seed selection and experiments of all kinds will be carried out. A herd of pedigree cattle is to be established. A laboratory for veterinary research is to be erected. The station will be available for intending settlers who may wish to gain experience before commencing farming in the Territory. Land suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 15s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

Extensive mineral deposits of lead and zinc have been located at Broken Hill and of copper at Bwana Mkuwana and elsewhere in the north-western districts. Gold and silver have been discovered and coal exists in quantity but is not being worked at present. The total value of the mineral output of Northern Rhodesia from the commencement of operations to the 31st December, 1925, amounted to £3,408,868L. In the year 1925, 236 tons of zinc, 3,352 tons of lead, 5,266 ounces of silver, 1,248 ounces of gold, 75 tons of copper and half-ton of mica were produced.

| Year | Exports | Imports |

| 1921 | £65,401 | £741,611 |
| 1922 | £616,083 | £500,321 |
| 1923 | £463,585 | £528,068 |
| 1924 | £455,917 | £684,183 |
| 1925 | £432,997 | £1,317,907 |

Included in the exports for the year 1925 were Animals (living) £57,723L.; Hides, Skins and Horns, £15,062L.; Ivory, £8,280L.; Foodstuffs, £52,176L.; Tobacco (unmanufactured), £99,122L.; Raw Cotton, £6,276L.; Vanadium, £5,350L.; Pig Lead and Ingots, £66,442L.; Gold, £5,281L.; Timber (unmanufactured) £11,477L.

Means of Communication.

The extension of the railway from Victoria Falls northward was opened for traffic as far as Broken Hill, 374 miles from the Falls, in 1906, and the further extension to the northern border of Northern Rhodesia was completed by the Rhodesia Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company Limited in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a bridge 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet above the level of the river. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa. Road communications are gradually being opened and good motor tracks are now in use from Livingstone to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge, and also to Abercorn and from thence to Tanganyika and Kenya Colony. The Zambesi, Katue, Luapula, and Chambesi rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyasaland. There are 40 post offices in the territory, 11 of which are money order offices.
There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and other lines link up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the territory is 2,227 miles.

NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.†

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shire Highlands and Milanje.

It is bounded on the north by Tanganyika Territory, on the west by Northern Rhodesia, on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and according to the most recent survey has a total area of about 39,966 square miles (land, 37,890).

It is divided into four Provinces, each under the control of a Provincial Commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into twenty districts, each in charge of a resident, who is also a district magistrate.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 400 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

History.

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of

† See Map under Southern Rhodesia.
September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (now Sir H. H. Johnston, G.C.M.G., K.C.B.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaos round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlozi, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shire districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wahenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (now Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shire and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaos at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. On the 22nd February, 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in October, 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

**Constitution.**

The administration of the Protectorate, which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Nairobi.

**Climate and Products.**

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shire Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shire Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shire Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

**Industry.**

The chief products of the Protectorate are cotton, tobacco, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat and fibre.

Cotton has rapidly increased and the export reached 3,462,478 lbs. in 1916-17, but fell to 866,510 lbs. in 1917-18 owing to shipping restrictions; it rose again in 1918-19 to 2,670,834 lbs., and in 1919-20 dropped to 930,048 lbs. owing to market fluctuations. The export for the year ended 31st December, 1925, was 2,291,875 lbs. Tobacco shows a considerable increase; in the year ended 31st December, 1925, 6,917,439 lbs. were exported. 98.3 per cent. of the export trade in 1925 was to the United Kingdom and British Colonies. Further development is greatly dependent on improved transport, which it is hoped will be provided in the form of a bridge across the Zambesi and a railway to Lake Nyasa.

The chief imports are, provisions, cotton goods, motor vehicles, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition. 76.24 per cent of the imports in 1925 came from the United Kingdom and British Colonies.

**Population (31st December, 1925).**

Europeans, 1,458; Asiatics, 724; Natives, 1,206,801.

**Means of Communication.**

A railway from Port Herald, on the Lower Shire, to Blantyre, 113 miles, via Chiromo and Luchenza, was built by the Shire Highlands...
Railway, under an agreement made in 1902 with the Nyasaland Government under which a subsidy was paid to the Railway. Subsequently the Central African Railway Co., Ltd., constructed a section, opened in 1915, from Chindio on the Zambesi to Port Herald, 61 miles, of which the first 45 are on Portuguese territory. Both lines are of 3ft. 6in. gauge. A railway of the same gauge was opened for traffic in April, 1922, by the Trans-Zambesia Railway Co., Ltd., which runs from Murraca on the south bank of the Zambesi to Dondo, the junction with the Mashonaland trunk line, about 20 miles from Beira (165 miles, all in Portuguese territory). The Nyasaland Government has had under consideration a railway from Luchenza to Lake Nyasa. There are eight British steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shiré between Chinde and the railway terminus. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being about 4,000. There are eight steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Mails to and from England, are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

The total mileage through the Protectorate is 787 miles. Telegrams may also be transmitted over the railway line and the Portuguese line between Chinde and Tete.

Education.

An Educational policy is being prepared by the recently appointed Director of Education. Provision will be made for the education of European children; native education, at present in the hands of the missionary societies, will be controlled by the Government.

A grant of 4,000l. was made by the Government in 1926.

Currency and Banking.

By a Proclamation of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling.

Banking operations in the Protectorate are governed by "The Banking Ordinance, 1902."

Two Banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited, and The National Bank of South Africa, Limited; the former has a branch at Zomba, and agencies at other centres.

A Post Office Savings Bank has also been established in the Protectorate.
