* TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 50 miles, and its average breadth 37½ miles, and its area is 1,862 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachare, the most westerly of the Boas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 60 & 61 Vict., c. 44. on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalised his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made

* TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 50 miles, and its average breadth 37½ miles, and its area is 1,862 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44. on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island.

scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago at the census of 1921 was 365,913. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 126,238. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of Six members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted by Letters Patent and an Order in Council which came into operation on 21st August, 1924. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, and not more than nine other official members, and of not more than six nominated unofficial members and seven elected members. Trinidad is divided into six electoral districts, each returning one member. Tobago forms the seventh electoral district.

**General Description.**

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Government acquired in May, 1910, the floating graving dock and workshops formerly worked by the Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company under agreement with the Government, and the concern was, up to the 30th June, 1921, carried on by the Government as a business administration. On 1st July, 1921, the administration was dissolved, and the Dock and Workshops placed under the control of the Public Works Department. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 65 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the administration. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples. The quantities exported in

| Year | Quantity | Value |
|------|----------|-------|
|      |          |       |
| 1925 |          |       |
| Cocoa | 56,749,600 lbs. | 1,462,723 |
| Sugar | 60,655 tons | 1,092,594 |
| Rum   | 28,510 galls. | 5,337 |
| Molasses | 1,271,050 | 29,639 |
| Petroleum (refined) | 2,768,821 | 62,202 |
| Kerosene | 110,038,226 | 1,155,496 |
| (fuel) | 13,457,638 | 345,170 |
| (crude) | 157,986 tons | 360,662 |
| Asphalt or Pitch | 8,667,271 nuts | 45,993 |
| Coconuts | 9,966,499 lbs. | 131,243 |
| Copra | 58,336 galls. | 75,734 |

Sugar manufacture is mainly in the hands of a few large companies, which have improved the efficiency of their factories by the investment of part of the profits made during the short period of prosperity. The times are not favourable for the investment of any large amount of new capital.

Coconut cultivation is still extending, and recently planted areas will soon be in bearing. The great fall in price, to below pre-war times, has however given a check to this industry also.

The minerals at present worked are chiefly asphalt and petroleum.

**Asphalt.**—An asphalt lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the Ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain. It is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by the Trinidad Lake Asphalt Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of Great Britain, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of 10,000l., and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease was for 21 years from 1st January, 1888, and was extended for a further term of 21 years from 1st February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of 4,000l. a year for each year of such extension.

A new lease has since been entered into with the Company, to come into operation on the 1st February, 1930, for a further term of 21 years, under which the Company has agreed to pay the Government a royalty of 2s. 6d. and an export duty of 5s. on each ton of crude pitch or asphaltum, and a royalty of 3s. 6d. and an export duty of 6s. 11d. on each ton of dried pitch or asphaltum, the minimum royalty and export duty not to be less than 24,000l. in any one year.

The revenue derived from asphalt in 1925 was 75,375l.
Petroleum.—At the close of 1925 there were nineteen Companies engaged in the production of oil in the Colony. The number of wells drilled during the year was 99, bringing the total number drilled at 31st December, 1925, to 1,027, of which 658 are on Crown Lands. The Royalty paid by operating Companies on oil won from Crown Lands during 1925 amounted to £40,099, as against £31,006l. in 1924.

The quantity of oil extracted during 1926 was 153,527,746 imperial gallons, an increase of 11,546,326 gallons as compared with 1924. The quantity exported amounted to 126,231,287 gallons valued at £1,560,579l., as against 112,858,523 gallons valued at £1,367,160l., exported in 1924. The principal Oil Companies engaged in the winning of Oil are the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Petroleum Development Company, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease; the United British Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, partly from their own and partly from Crown Lands; the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease and from private lands at Barrackpore; the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaque; the Apex (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and Private Lands at Fyzabad; the Kern (Trinidad) Oilfields Limited, from private lands at Guapo, and the General Petroleum Company, of Trinidad, from private lands at Oropouche. There are still large areas of Crown Lands held under licence by the Trinidad Petroleum Development Company, Limited, and the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited. When the geological surveys have been completed certain portions of these areas will be taken up under lease, and the remainder will revert to the Crown. The total area of Crown Lands held by Companies under lease, prospecting and exploration licences aggregates some 204,286 acres. Four important refineries are engaged in the manufacture of oil fuel, petrol, and kerosene, while a few small topping plants produce petrol, distillate and residual oils.

Renewed interest is being taken in the establishment of a fruit industry. The promising trade in bananas which was established a few years previous to the War, and was mainly responsible for exports valued at £19,962l. in 1910, was stopped owing to lack of shipping accommodation, and exports fell to £982l. in 1916. In recent years some small plantations of oranges and grape-fruit have been established, and steps are being taken towards the formation of a Co-operative Fruit-growers Association. In 1925 the value of fruit exported was £1,636l.

The cultivation of Para rubber has been successfully carried out on one estate.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. About one-third, one-fifth and one-third of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States of America respectively.

The following table gives the direction of the import trade for the last five years.

|                | 1921   | 1922   | 1923   | 1924   | 1925   |

| Other Countries| £199,985 | £213,978 | £198,217 | £162,989 | £187,363 |

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The mean temperature for the year was 78° and the rainfall 49·40 inches.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1921, 61,580), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1925, 32 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 6,366 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

By Ordinance No. 24 of 1914, Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city, and its powers and duties were further extended by Ordinances Nos. 25 and 28 of 1914, and No. 36 of 1918. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.

The next town and port is San Fernando, about 30 miles south from Port of Spain. The population at the census of 1921 was 10,610.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population at 1921 census, 4,210). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1925, was £157,836l., the expenditure, £157,604l., and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was £297,234l. on the 31st December, 1925. This includes the loan of £84,000l. for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.
Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,264,891 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1925, was estimated to be approximately 683,219 acres. About 541,682 acres are under cultivation; 581,672 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly Coastal Steamship Service between Trinidad and Tobago by the Steamer "Belize," going every alternative week by the northern and southern routes, and calling at all the principal ports. This service was previously run by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Limited, but in March, 1923, the Government purchased the s.s. "Belize," and is running the Service through local Agents (Alston & Co.)

The Government also own a small steamer which maintains communication to the island resorts between Port of Spain and the Bocas, including the prison establishments and the lighthouse. The steamer (run in connection with the Railway) makes two trips a week between San Fernando and La Brea (near the celebrated Pitch Lake), the Oilfields, Cedros, and to the south-western point of the island at Icacos, stopping at eight intermediate places along the coast, and carrying passengers and goods.

The railway was commenced by a line between Port of Spain and Arima, 16 miles, opened in 1876, and by subsequent extensions the railway system now consists of the Port of Spain—Arima—Sancre Grande line (opened in 1897) 29 miles along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast. The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1880, San Fernando in 1882, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.

The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabaquite in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction (14½ miles from Port of Spain) and running in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.

The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Marabella Junction (33 miles from Port of Spain) and running in an easterly direction to Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles, and

The Cipero tramway, to the south of San Fernando, also proceeding by another route to Princes Town, which, with branches (13 miles), was merged into the railway system in 1912.

The line between Port of Spain and St. Joseph (7½ miles) has been doubled.

The total length of this system is now 149 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 12 trains daily each way.

The railway stations are in telegraphic communication one with the other on all parts of the system open to the public, and there is a telephone line south-west of San Fernando along the steamer route, giving a total length of about 127 miles of telegraph and about 116 miles of telephone lines.

The total receipts from the railways, railway steamers, telegraphs and telephones for the year 1926 amounted to 166,589£., and the working expenses to 196,922£., exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to 79,272£. There has been a considerable falling off in the Railway receipts during the last few years, which is due to competition from motor omnibuses and lorries.

The total number of passengers carried during 1925 was 1,260,096. The total tonnage of goods (including canes, 96,873 tons) was 279,325 tons.

The Island is intersected by numerous roads either metalled or gravelled, and capable of carrying fairly heavy motor traffic. Many of the most important roads have been reconstructed in recent years, and their surfaces treated with Trinidad Road Oil or Trinidad Road Binder. This method of construction is being steadily pursued. The total mileage of roadway is 2,357·86 miles, of which 1,734·47 miles of main and local roads are under the control of the Public Works Department, and 616·56 miles of local roads are under the control of Road Boards.

There are numerous motor bus services plying along the Eastern Main Road between Port of Spain and Arima, and along the Southern Main Road between Port of Spain and San Fernando. These services are not continuous, individual owners plying for hire along different sections of the routes.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and 112 out-offices throughout the Colony.

Communication by cable with the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and other parts of the world is maintained by the Pacific Cable Board (All Red Route) and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company.

The Pacific Cable Board established their service in the West Indies during the year 1924, and opened their offices for business on the 1st December of the same year.

Their cables run from Barbados to Turks Island, with spurs from the former place to Trinidad and Demerara. At Turks Island connection is made with the Direct Company's cables to Halifax. Traffic is handed back to the Pacific Cable Board's Office at Halifax and thence via Imperial Cables, an all British line of communication thus being established to England.

A wireless system of communication is also maintained between the following Islands—Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, Carriacou, St. Lucia, Dominica, Antigua, Montserrat and St. Kitts.

The principal tariffs are:

To the United Kingdom from Port-of-Spain ... ... 2/4 per word To Eastern Canada ... ... 1/6 ,, ,, To Western Canada ... ... 1/8½,, ,, There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

The West India and Panama Telegraph Company, until recently the only Company operating in the Colony, has a duplicate cable system. Both cables on leaving Trinidad touch at Grenada.
where they separate until they meet again at St. Lucia, Porto Rico, Jamaica and terminate at Santiago, Cuba, where the Company hand over their traffic to the Cuba Submarine Company who in turn at Havana hand over to the West Union Telegraph Company which has a duplicate cable system to New York.

The shorter and more direct cable between Trinidad and Santiago, Cuba, touches at the Island of St. Croix (with a branch line to St. Thomas).

The other cable on leaving Grenada serves St. Vincent (with a branch duplicate line to Barbados), St. Lucia, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Antigua, St. Kitts and St. Thomas and meets its sister cable at Porto Rico and Jamaica; they both terminate at Santiago, Cuba.

The Company's cables connect with the French Cable Company's line at Guadeloupe and Porto Rico, which proceeds to New York via Hayti. In addition their lines connect with the Direct West Indian Cable Company's (called the All British route) Line at Jamaica, which proceeds from there to Bermuda, Halifax and the United Kingdom.

Three Government wireless stations were in operation during 1925, namely Port-of-Spain, North Post and Tobago. The North Post Station deals exclusively with ship and Tobago traffic, while communication with British Guiana, St. Martin, Venezuela and Paramaribo is carried out by Port-of-Spain.

Steamers calling at Trinidad comprised the following lines, besides a number of steamers calling for bunker coal, oil and orders:—Royal Mail Steam Packet Co., Leyland Line, Harrison Line, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, La Veloce (Navigatione Italiana), Trinidad Line (Furness Withy and Co., Ltd.), Lamport and Holt, Prince Line, Cia Anonima Venezolana de Navigacion Transatlantica Italiana, Royal Netherlands West India Mail, Canadian Government Merchant Marine, Clyde Steamship Line, Hamburg-Amerika Line and the Horne Line. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government and in dollars by the public, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1903 an Ordinance providing for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been issued, the total value in circulation at 31st December, 1925, amounting to 106,625L.

Government Savings Banks are established in 31 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1925, was 27,672, with deposits amounting to 358,094L. The savings banks are largely made use of by the East Indians, of whom at the 31st December, there were 10,790 depositors. The amount deposited by this section of the community during the year is estimated at 73,949L.

The Private Banks are Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), paid up capital 900,000L; with a note circulation in the Colony estimated at 750,000L.; the Royal Bank of Canada, paid up capital 5,083,333L., with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of 312,500L.; Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company, Limited, paid up capital of 600,000L.; and the Canadian Bank of Commerce, paid up capital 4,109,689L., with an authorized note circulation of 9750,000L. In addition to engaging in banking business of every character Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce have savings bank branches and pay the same rate of interest as is paid by the Government Savings Bank, viz. 3 per cent.

Education.

The following Colleges afford facilities for the higher education of boys:—The Queen's Royal College and its affiliated institutions, the St. Mary's College in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima College in San Fernando. The St. Joseph's Convent and the Bishop's High School in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima Girls' High School in San Fernando, which are also affiliated to the Queen's Royal College, provide similar education for girls. There is also a Bishop's High School in Tobago for boys and girls. The affiliated institutions work under the same curriculum as the Queen's Royal College, and receive a Government grant-in-aid. Attached to these institutions are two scholarships of 800L. which are granted annually at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire, one being confined to agricultural Science.

There were—at the end of December, 1925—235 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 360 on those of St. Mary's College, 120 at the Naparima College, 401 at St. Joseph's Convent School, 102 at the Bishop's High School and 91 at the Naparima Girls' High School.

The elementary schools are now 290 in number, 48 of which are supported entirely by the Government, and 242 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the five intermediate schools, three of which are assisted, 5s. per month is charged. There are two Government and four denominational colleges for teachers, in which 23 students are trained. The Government schools in 1925 had 9,967 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 48,833.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 67,725, with an average daily attendance of about 36,404. The teaching of practical agriculture is now part of the daily routine in the majority of boys' and mixed schools in the Colony. 290 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1925.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institution for the instruction of the blind.
TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1664, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the Island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefrey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Situation and Area.

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 28 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,213 acres, of which about 33,116 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The population of Tobago in 1921 was 23,378 according to census.

General Description.

Cocoa, coconuts, copra and live stock form the principal articles of export, and the cultivation of the first two is still being extended. But little sugar is now produced. Vegetables, poultry, eggs and fruit are produced in considerable quantities, and find ready sale in the Trinidad markets to which in 1925 19,619l. worth were exported. Exports from Tobago for the year ending 31st December, 1925, were valued at 87,820l.

Principal items—

| Item                  | Value   |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Cocoa                 | 36,152l.|
| Coconuts and Products | 19,861l.|
| Other Products        | 31,807l.|

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1921, of 773. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of a coastal steamer, provided by the Government.

The island possesses a large mileage of good roads and these are rapidly being extended and improved.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represents Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and
Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.
