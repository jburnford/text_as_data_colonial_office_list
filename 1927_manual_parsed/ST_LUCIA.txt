ST. LUCIA.

Situation and Area.

The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus, during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 15° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long.; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 24 miles in length, and 12 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is 150 miles, and its area 233-29 sq. miles, rather less than Middlesex. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, contains about 1,422 houses, and a population of 5,899 according to the census of 24th April, 1921. Next in importance is the town of Soufrière, containing a population of 2,480.

History.

At the period of its discovery St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600L to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663 Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orléans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Islet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms on the 4th of April, 1794.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Greenfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

General Description.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by intestine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect, and the population at 31 December, 1925, is estimated at 55,099. Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but English is gradually becoming more generally used. A very small percentage is of European descent, the remainder being of the negro race, except 2,189 of East Indian origin. The reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is undeserved, the death rate for 1925 being 18-8 per 1,000, and for the year 1924 21-4 per 1,000. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation.

The danger from venomous reptiles is also much exaggerated. Owing to the introduction and spread of the mongoose, snakes are now but rarely met with. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are almost unknown. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday, in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera.

Castries, the chief town, has an excellent harbour, Dredging operations have been carried out in the harbour, rendering it more commodious. A substantial concrete wharf, 650 feet in length, with a depth alongside of 27 feet at low water, has been completed, and the western wharf, having a length of 552 feet, has been refaced in wood, and dredged to an average depth alongside of 18 feet to 24 feet. The facilities offered by the port as a port of call and coaling station are widely recognised. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1925, 16 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 463 tons.
St. Lucia

There is a Roman Catholic second-grade school, which has over 100 boys on the roll; the Sisters of St. Joseph conduct a similar school for Girls. The number of pupils on the roll is 130 and a Government grant of 175l. is made to the school annually.
A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and has now 726 depositors, with 13,599£ to their credit on 31st December, 1925. Branch savings banks were opened at Soufrière and Vieux Fort in March, 1898, at Denney and Gros Islet in November, 1905, and at Anse-la-Raye in December, 1906.

**Constitution and Law.**

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy. The Courts of Justice were an inferior Court called the "Sénéchausée," and a higher Court, called the "Conseil Supérieur," or Court of Appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided, and it was invested with certain executive and administrative functions.

The Government is now conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council. By an Order in Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of six ex-officio members, three nominated unofficial members and three elected members. The Island is divided into three electoral districts, each returning one elected member. The first election under this constitution was held in March, 1925. Law is administered by a Chief Justice, from whom in civil cases there is an appeal to the West Indian Court of Appeal, and two magistrates, whose decisions are liable to review by the judge. In criminal cases tried in the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of twelve as in England.

A code of civil law, the authors of which were Sir G. W. Des Voeux, G.C.M.G., and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., became law in October, 1879. This code was framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances. The Statute Law of the Colony was consolidated to 1916 by Mr. F. H. Coller, Chief Justice, who also edited the Commercial Code, 1916.

The revising and editing of the Criminal Law and Procedure of the Colony by Mr. J. E. M. Salmon was completed during 1920 and proclaimed as the Criminal Code, 1920. It came into force on the 1st January, 1921.

**Education.**

On the 30th June, 1891, the trustees of the Lady Mico charity closed the eleven schools which they had till then maintained, and withdrew their connection with the Colony. Three of these schools became Government schools, and the others assisted schools under the new Education Ordinance. In 1898 all the Government schools were handed over to the Roman Catholic body, and became assisted schools. There were, on the 31st December, 1925, 49 assisted schools. Of these, four were Anglican, three Wesleyan and 42 Roman Catholic. The number of children on the rolls was 8,198, with an average attendance of 5,491, and the amount spent by the Colony on primary education was 5,146£. The Government grants 400£ a year to a Roman Catholic second-grade school, which has over 100 boys on the roll; the Sisters of St. Joseph conduct a similar school for Girls. The number of pupils on the roll is 130 and a Government grant of 175£ is made to the school annually.

**Industry.**

Sugar, rum, cocoa, logwood, coconuts, limes, bananas, Bay oil, Bay rum, and spices are produced. There are four sugar "Usines" with the best machinery, and the export of cocoa is increasing. Limes are being extensively planted, and a Government Factory has been erected in Castries, with the object of encouraging the establishment of the industry among small proprietors, at which limes and lime-juice are purchased at market rates. Rubber and cotton grow well, and samples of the former prepared at the Botanic Station, from trees growing there, have received favourable reports.

A considerable amount of land is in the possession of the Crown, and may be purchased in lots up to and including 50 acres, at £1 per acre, and for every acre beyond 50 at 10/- per acre, payable by four equal annual instalments. In the event of a certain area being put into permanent cultivation before the due date of the last instalment, that instalment may be remitted. Under the Crown Lands Regulations, the period over which (in certain cases) the payment of the purchase money may be spread is ten years. The soil will grow any kind of tropical fruit trees or economic plants.

Surveys are made at the cost of the purchaser.
