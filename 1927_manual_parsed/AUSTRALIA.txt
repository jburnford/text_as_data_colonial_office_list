AUSTRALIA.

THE COMMONWEALTH.

The Commonwealth of Australia is constituted under an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1900—63 & 64 Vict., cap. 12. By this Act it was made lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the Privy Council, to proclaim that, on and after a day appointed in the proclamation, the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, and also if Her Majesty were satisfied that the people of Western Australia had agreed thereto, of Western Australia, should be united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia.

A proclamation was accordingly issued by Her Majesty on the 17th of September, 1900, appointing the 1st of January, 1901, as the day on which the Commonwealth should be established—Western Australia being included as an original State in accordance with the result of a referendum taken before that date in the Colony and with Addresses passed by both Houses of the Legislature.

A short history of the events leading up to the establishment of the Commonwealth, and of the provisions of the Constitution, as fixed by the Act of Parliament above quoted, is given below. The account of the different States of the Commonwealth is arranged alphabetically, and a description of territories dependent on the Commonwealth follows.

The Earl of Hopetoun (afterwards Marquis of Linlithgow) was selected as the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth, a Commission was issued to him on the 29th of October, 1900, and he was sworn on the 1st January, 1901.

It was announced in September that the Queen would issue a special Commission to H.R.H. the Duke of York, for opening in Her Majesty's name the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament in the spring of 1901, and that H.R.H., accompanied by the Duchess of York, would pay visits to the different States of the Commonwealth. At the invitation of the Government of New South Wales, a representative body of troops, about 1,000 strong, sailed from England in November, to attend the inauguration of the Commonwealth at Sydney on the 1st of January, 1901. A small detachment of officers and non-commissioned officers of the Indian Army also proceeded to Sydney on the same occasion. The Commission issued by the Queen to the Duke of York was renewed on the accession of King Edward VII. The Duke and Duchess landed at Melbourne on the 6th of May, and on the 9th the Duke opened the first session of the first Commonwealth Parliament in the Exhibition Building at Melbourne. The Duke and Duchess subsequently visited Brisbane, Sydney, New Zealand, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth, leaving Australia on the 26th of July to continue their tour to Mauritius, South Africa and North America.

Australian Federation.

Until the passing of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act the only means of joint legislative action in Australia was provided by the "Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1886" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act created a Council of two members from each Colony which adopted the Act, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which had only one member each, with power to Her Majesty at the request of the Legislatures of the Colonies to increase the number of representatives for each Colony by Order in Council. Such an increase was upon the request of the Legislatures made by Her Majesty on 3rd March, 1894, when an Order in Council was passed, providing that each Colony which was or should be represented on the Federal Council, except any Crown Colony, be represented by five members. This Council had power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits, service and enforcement respectively of civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they had been passed, the extradition of offenders, and the custody of offenders on ships belonging to Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two or more Colonies might also refer to it for legislation questions of defence, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, status of corporations, and joint stock companies, and other matters of general Australasian interest; but legislation of the Council on such matters was to extend only to the Colonies by whose Legislatures the matters should have been so referred, and such Colonies as might afterwards adopt the same. It had also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent. The Council was to meet at least once in every two years.

The first meeting took place on 25th January, 1886, when representatives were present from
Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed authorising the service of the civil powers and the enforcement of the judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented, and various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits. The second session opened on 16th January, 1888. An address was adopted to Her Majesty respecting the deportation of French criminals to the Pacific. An Act was also passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Béche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Queensland. The Council met for its third session on 29th January, 1889, when representatives from South Australia were present for the first time. An Act was passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Béche-de-mer Fisheries in Australian waters adjacent to Western Australia. The amendment of the basis of representation in the Council was discussed at the session, and communications on the subject subsequently passed with the Imperial Government. The fourth session opened on 20th January, and closed on 24th January, 1891. South Australia was not represented, the Act (a temporary measure for two years only) under which that province joined the Council having expired. The only Bill passed was one to facilitate the recognition in other Colonies of Orders and Declarations of the Supreme Court of any Colony in matters of lunacy. An address to Her Majesty was also adopted referring to the desirability of British subjects being placed on an equal footing with subjects of other countries in regard to the acquisition of land in, and trading with, natives of the New Hebrides.

The fifth session was commenced on 26th January, 1893, when the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia were represented. An Act was passed providing for the discipline and government of the garrisons established at King George's Sound and Thursday Island; and a resolution was adopted in favour of an increase in the number of representatives for each Colony, except any Crown Colony, to five. The Standing Committee was instructed to take steps for giving effect to this resolution, and also for securing the adhesion of the Colonies not represented in the Council. As the result of action taken by the Standing Committee, the Legislatures of all the Colonies in the Council addressed Her Majesty, requesting that the proposed increase in the number of representatives might be made; and, on 3rd March, 1894, Her Majesty was pleased to make an Order in Council providing "that each Colony which is or shall be represented in the said Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members."

The sixth session opened on the 30th January, 1896, when the same four Colonies were represented as at the preceding session. There were present, for the first time, five delegates from each Colony. At this session no Bills were brought forward, but resolutions were adopted affirming the desirability of defining the status, and of granting facilities for the winding up of companies carrying on business in different Colonies; of rendering uniform the laws relating to banking; of establishing an effectual system of quarantine; of adopting a more economic method of raising public loans; and of taking steps with a view to the holding of a second Federation Convention. An address to the Queen was also adopted praying for the appointment of an Australian representative on the Privy Council Bench, in view of the special features often presented by Australian appeals.

The seventh session was commenced on 26th January, 1897, when the Colonies of Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia, were represented. An Act was passed, upon a reference of the matter to the Council by the Legislatures of Victoria and Queensland, to provide for the naturalisation within the Australian Colonies, or some of them, of persons of European descent naturalised in any of such Colonies, also upon a reference of the subject by the Legislatures of Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, an Act was passed to make provision for the enforcement in certain cases within the Australian Colonies, or some of them, of Orders of the Supreme Court of such Colonies for the production of testamentary instruments. The Council adopted an Address to Her Majesty, referring to the Address adopted in 1891 with regard to restrictions in the way of trade with the natives of the New Hebrides, urging that negotiations should be entered into with the other Powers concerned with a view to imposing on their subjects equal restrictions in that trade. This and all the previous sessions were held at Hobart. The Council resolved that the place of its next meeting should be Melbourne.

The Commonwealth Act.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Federal Council, however, a movement was made for the establishment of a more effective Federation, to embrace a Federal Executive, as well as Legislature, somewhat upon the model of Canada. Towards the end of 1889 negotiations were opened between the various Australasian Colonies, the result being that a Conference of the seven principal Australasian Colonies met in Melbourne, on the 6th February, 1890. At this Conference it was unanimously agreed that the best interests of the Australian Colonies would be promoted by their "early union under the Crown," and that the Legislatures of the various Colonies should be invited to appoint a National Australasian Convention during the year 1890 delegates empowered to report upon the scheme for a Federal Constitution.

In accordance with these resolutions, delegates were appointed, and the Convention commenced its deliberations in Sydney on the 2nd March, 1891. After an animated discussion, which lasted more than five weeks, a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia" was drawn up and adopted. The Convention recommended that this Bill should be submitted by the Parliaments for the approval of the people of the several Colonies. It provided for the union of the Australasian Colonies in a Federal Commonwealth under the Crown: for a Governor-General to be appointed by the Crown, who should be aided and advised by an Executive Council: the constitution of a Senate and House of Representatives, with certain definite powers, the latter to have the initiation of money bills, which the former might pass or reject, but not amend: for the establishment of a Federal Judicature: the revenue of the Commonwealth to be derived from the Customs and Excise duties, and other taxation, which should be collected by Federal officers, and expended as required for Federal purposes, any surplus to be returned to the respective Colonies. It also provided for absolute free trade internally throughout the Commonwealth, so soon as the Parliament should have imposed uniform Customs duties. The draft Bill of
1891, though it crystallised the idea of Federation, failed to command the serious attention of the Legislatures, and Federalists began a popular agitation to place the movement on a new footing.

A meeting of the Premiers of all the Australasian Colonies took place in Hobart in January, 1896, and agreed to a scheme for framing a Federal Constitution to be submitted for the approval of their respective Parliaments. The Enabling Bill, agreed to at this Conference providing for the election by each Colony of 10 delegates to prepare a scheme of Federation, was adopted by the Parliaments of N. S. Wales, Victoria, S. Australia, and Tasmania, and in a modified form by Western Australia.

Delegates were accordingly duly elected and assembled in Convention at Adelaide on 22nd March, 1897, for the purpose of drafting a constitution. Having prepared a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia," the Convention was on the 23rd April adjourned to reassemble at Sydney on 2nd September. The draft Bill was in the meantime submitted to the local Legislatures, and various amendments were suggested by those bodies. The Bill, together with those amendments, was further considered by the Delegates at the Sydney Session of the Convention, and a long discussion took place on various proposals submitted for settling questions of difference between the two Houses of the new Federal Legislature. Considerable progress was made with the rest of the measure, but the work of revision was not completed, and the Convention adjourned until 20th January, 1898, partly in the hope of seeing delegates from Queensland join in the final discussion. This hope was not realised, as the Queensland Legislature, for the second time, shelved the Enabling Bill.

The Convention met again at Melbourne on the 20th of January, 1898, and remained in session till the 17th of March, and a Bill was adopted which in accordance with the Federation Enabling Acts of the different Colonies was submitted to the popular vote for acceptance or rejection. In Victoria the polling was—For acceptance, 100,520; against, 22,099. The Bill was also accepted by the vote of the people in South Australia and Tasmania. But in New South Wales the statutory minimum number of 80,000 affirmative votes required by the Enabling Act of that Colony was not obtained, and the matter fell through for the time.

A further Conference of Premiers was held at Melbourne in January, 1899, to consider the objections of New South Wales; and this time Queensland was represented. The Premiers met in a spirit of compromise, and on the 2nd of February an agreement was come to which all the Premiers agreed to submit to their Parliaments for reference to the electors, it being understood that New South Wales should lead the way. South Australia, however, for purposes of local convenience, took a referendum vote upon the Bill on the occasion of the General Election, without waiting for New South Wales. This vote was taken on the 29th of April, when 65,990 votes were given for Federation and 17,053 against.

In New South Wales, the Bill providing for the reference to the people of the amended draft constitution was passed by the Lower House on the 2nd of March, but in the Upper House amendments were made. One of these required that one-third of the electors on the register should vote for the Bill in order to secure its acceptance. The Bill as amended passed the Legislative Council on the 21st of March. On the 22nd March the Lower House rejected the amendments of the Upper House. The latter body refused to give way. A conference between the two Houses was held without result on the 28th of March. Mr. Reid, Premier of New South Wales, prorogued Parliament for a few days, and on his advice the Governor added twelve new members to the Council. The Bill was re-introduced in the Lower House, and passed on the 13th of April. It was accepted by the Legislative Council with an unimportant amendment (providing that a period of eight weeks should elapse before the referendum was taken) on the 20th of April, and on the 25th of April it was announced that the question would be submitted to the electors on the 20th of June. It was accepted by a majority of about 25,000.

On the 27th July, the amended Commonwealth Bill was accepted by overwhelming majorities in Victoria and Tasmania, and on the 2nd September by a majority of about 7,500 in Queensland. The delay in taking action in Western Australia led to some correspondence between Sir John Forrest, Premier of Western Australia, and Mr. Reid. Mr. Reid declared on behalf of the Federating Colonies that no amendments to meet the views entertained in Western Australia could now be considered; and the same assurance was repeated by Sir G. Turner, Premier of Victoria. Sir J. Forrest, in fulfilment of his undertaking at the Premiers' conference, brought the draft Constitution before the Legislature, which referred it to a Select Committee, who reported that it should not be accepted without considerable amendment. The Legislative Council finally refused to allow a referendum to be taken.

Addresses to the Queen from the five Colonies which had accepted the Constitution praying for the enactment of the Commonwealth Bill were received in the autumn of 1899.

As it appeared that some alterations in the Bill might be required by the Imperial Government, Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Governor of New South Wales, expressing the hope that delegates were coming home to advise and assist during the passage of the Bill through Parliament.

Delegates were appointed, and reached England in March. Western Australia also sent a delegate to represent the views of that Colony, and the Agent-General for New Zealand was appointed to watch the interests of New Zealand.

The discussion between Her Majesty's Government and the Delegates turned chiefly on the clauses of the Bill relating to the Appeals to the Privy Council. Under the Bill, in Section 74, appeals were allowed both from the Supreme Courts of the States and from the Federal High Court, but there was a limitation in cases affecting the interpretation of the Constitution of the Commonwealth or of a State "unless the public interests of some part of Her Majesty's dominions other than the Commonwealth or a State are involved." Various memoranda passed on this subject of Clause 74, the delegates demurring to any alteration in the Bill, whilst Her Majesty's Government pointed out the difficulty of interpreting the Clause, and the danger that it might unduly restrict the right of appeal in cases where the interests of foreigners or British subjects outside Australia were affected.

The Bill was introduced into Parliament with amendments to secure Her Majesty's prerogative to grant special leave of appeal from the High Court of the Commonwealth or the Supreme Court of any State to the Privy Council. But the discussion with the delegates continued, and two successive compromises were arrived at. First, the appeal on Constitutional questions was made
dependent on the consent of the Executive Government or Governments concerned, and finally was made dependent on a certificate to be granted at the discretion of the High Court.

No other amendments of any consequence were made by Parliament in the Bill as received from Australia, except that provision was made for the inclusion of Western Australia as an original State, provided that Her Majesty was satisfied that the people of that Colony had agreed thereto prior to the issue of the Proclamation.

The Queen caused to be sent to Australia, for presentation to the Commonwealth Parliament, a duplicate of the Commission issued for the formal declaration of Her assent to the Act, together with the pen, inkstand, and table used on the occasion of its signature. She subsequently presented a duplicate of the Proclamation bringing the Act into force, duly signed and passed under the Great Seal.

**Constitution of the Commonwealth.**

The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australasia is contained in the Act of Parliament 63 & 64 Vict., cap. 12. The opening part of the Act recites that the union is to be indissoluble and provides for the admission of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the Queen. It makes provision for the proclamation and date of establishment of the Commonwealth, declares the binding force of Commonwealth laws, and makes definitions. The Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885, is repealed, and the Commonwealth is declared to be a single self-governing Colony for the purposes of the Colonial Boundaries Act. The proclamation was made on 17th September, 1900, constituting the Commonwealth as from 1st January, 1901.

The leading features of the Constitution proper are as follows:

- The Parliament consists of the King, a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Governor-General acts for the King.
- The Senate consists of six members from each State. The number may be increased or diminished, but so that the equal representation of the original States is maintained, and no original State has less than six Senators. Qualifications for Senators are the same as those for Members of the House of Representatives, as given below. Senators are chosen for six years. The qualifications of electors for the first Parliament were those for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State in which the elector was competent to vote. In the first Parliament of the Commonwealth the Franchise Act, 1902, unified the franchise for both Houses, on the basis of universal adult suffrage.
- The House of Representatives has approximately twice as many members as the Senate, and the number of members for each State is in proportion to the population, but not less than five for any State. The qualifications of electors are as stated in the preceding paragraph. Each elector is to vote only once. Qualification of a Member to be (a) 21 years of age; (b) to be an elector or entitled to be; (c) resident 3 years; (d) natural born or naturalised 5 years.
- House may continue to exist for 3 years from first meeting, but may be dissolved sooner; number of members may be increased or diminished by Parliament, subject to the Constitution.
- The general powers of the Parliament are grouped under 39 headings, the principal of which are to make laws for trade, taxation, bounties, borrowing, postal services, naval and military, census and statistics, currency, banking, insurance, insolvency, corporations, divorce, marriage, invalid and old age pensions, immigration and emigration, quarantine, industrial disputes, railways, &c. Exclusive powers are held in regard to the seat of Government, State departments transferred, and other matters declared by the Constitution to be within the exclusive power of the Parliament.
- Money Bills may not originate in, nor be amended by, the Senate, which House may, however, return the Bill requesting any omission or amendment. Equal power with the House of Representatives is possessed in respect of all other proposed laws. Tacking Bills are prohibited.
- Provision for Dead-locks.—Joint dissolution, and if again passed in Lower House and rejected in Senate a joint sitting to be held, and if passed by an absolute majority of total number of both Houses, disputed Bill to become law.
- A Bill having passed both Houses, the Governor-General shall either assent, withhold assent, reserve the Bill or return it and recommend amendments.
- Executive power vested in King and exercisable by Governor-General in Council, who may appoint Ministers of State.
- State departments of Customs and Excise transferred to Commonwealth on its establishment. Departments of posts, naval and military defence, lighthouses, &c., and quarantine, on a date or dates to be proclaimed (Posts, telegraphs, &c., and naval and military defence became transferred to the Commonwealth on 1st March, 1901; quarantine on 1st July, 1909; and lighthouses, &c., on 1st July, 1915).
- High Court of Australia established; appellate and original jurisdiction.
- Collection of Customs to pass to Commonwealth. Customs and Excise duties to be uniform, and intercolonial free-trade established within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, after which period the Federal Government shall have exclusive power to levy such duties and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods. Western Australia may continue duties in force on intercolonial goods at the establishment of uniform tariff for five years, subject to reduction of one-fifth each year.
- Of the net revenue from Customs and Excise not more than one-fourth to be applied by Commonwealth towards its expenditure. This holds good for the first 10 years and thereafter until the Parliament provides otherwise (Braddon clause).
- Right of States to reasonable use of river waters for conservation or irrigation reserved.
- Inter-State Commission provided for to regulate trade and commerce, and prevent discriminations being made by any State which may be deemed unreasonable or unjust to any other State. This Commission was established in 1913 and functioned till 1920, since which date no further appointments have been made.
- Constitutions, powers, and laws of States protected. State Debts may be taken over.
- Admission of new States provided for. Commonwealth to protect States against invasion or domestic violence.
- Seat of Government to be in New South Wales, not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and to be within Federal territory. Parliament to meet at Melbourne until it meets at the new capital. It is proposed to hold the first meeting of Parliament at the Federal Capital City (Canberra) in 1927.
An alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of any State, or the minimum number of representatives of a State, or altering its limits, or in any way affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation to it, shall not become law without the approval of a majority of the electors of such State.

The financial portion of the Act is too intricate to be briefly summarised. See Sections 81-106 of the Act.

Constitution may be altered by an absolute majority of each House; then to be submitted to electors, and if in a majority of States a majority of electors voting approve, also majority of all electors approve, then the change may be made. In case of a dead-lock between the two Houses, renewed after three months' interval, the Governor-General may submit the question to the electors in each State qualified to vote for the Lower House.

Two questions, both dealing with finance, were submitted to a referendum concurrently with the Federal elections of April 13th, 1910. The first provided that the Commonwealth should take the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise, and pay to the States a sum equal to one pound five shillings per annum per head of their population, to be determined according to the latest available Commonwealth statistics. A special payment was to be made to Western Australia, in view of the large contribution per capita made by that State to the Customs revenue. It was intended that this arrangement should take the place of the Braddon clause but it was rejected by the electorate. The Surplus Revenue Act, 1910, retained to the Commonwealth for ten years the whole of the Customs and Excise Revenue, subject to each State receiving an annual payment equal to 25s. per head of the population of the State. This arrangement is still in force, although various proposals have from time to time been made for its modification. Special allowances are still made to Western Australia and Tasmania. The second proposal related to the conversion of the State debts. The Constitution provided for the conversion of all the debts existing at the time of Federation, and it was the object of the second proposal to amend the Constitution so as to give the Commonwealth unlimited power to assume all State debts existing at any time. This was passed but the Commonwealth has not yet taken advantage of the powers thus conferred upon it.

Two more "proposed laws" for the alteration of the Constitution were submitted to a referendum on 26th April, 1911. They were:

A. Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) 1910, and

B. Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) 1910.

The object of A was to extend the legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament in four directions (a) Trade and Commerce (b) Corporations (c) Industrial Matters and (d) Trusts and Monopolies. The result would have been a great change in section 51 of the Constitution. The object of B was to give the Commonwealth the power of making laws for, or assuming control of, any business or industry which was declared by resolution of both Houses to be the subject of any monopoly. Both resolutions were rejected by a large majority. At the general election of 1913 (May 31st), six questions were submitted to referendum; each question representing a proposed alteration of the Constitution, on which the electors were asked to decide. Of these, five were the old questions of 1911 re-submitted, and the sixth dealt with railway disputes. All the proposals were again rejected, but by much smaller majorities than in 1911.

Referenda were taken on 19th December, 1919, regarding a constitutional extension of Commonwealth powers in legislation and the nationalisation of monopolies. In each case the majority of votes was not in favour of the proposed extension.

On 4th September, 1926, a referendum was taken regarding an alteration of the Constitution in relation to the extension of legislative powers in regard to (a) Industry and Commerce, and (b) Essential Services. In each case the majority of votes was not in favour of the proposed extension.

It will be observed from the summary given above that the Constitution follows that of the United States rather than that of Canada so far as the distribution of Federal and State powers is concerned. The matters belonging to the Commonwealth are limited to those expressly specified, and in other respects State powers are maintained. But its general political scheme rests on the doctrine of the constant responsibility to Parliament of an Administration formed with the approval of the Representative of the Crown.

The Governorships of the States are still filled by the Crown, and the Governors correspond on State business directly with the Secretary of State. The Governor-General is, however, kept informed of the correspondence passing between the Governors of the different States and the Colonial Office.

Legislation, &c.

Up to the present time the Parliament of the Commonwealth has sat in Melbourne, the State Parliamentary buildings being assigned to them, and the State Parliament occupying the Exhibition building in that city. The site for the capital of the Commonwealth (which under the Constitution Act must be in N.S.W. but not less than 100 miles from Sydney) was fixed in 1908 at Canberra, N.S.W., and, as stated previously, it is proposed to hold the first meeting there of the Federal Parliament in 1927.

The subjects engaging the attention of the Federal Parliament have been numerous and important. A record of legislation enacted from the inauguration of the Commonwealth to 1915 is given in the 1920 edition and from 1916 to 1920 in the 1923 edition of this work.

The following is a summary of the more important legislative enactments of the Commonwealth Parliament during the year 1926:

(i) Export Guarantee. Assistance is extended to growers of primary produce used in preparation of goods for export.

(ii) States Loan. Agreements may be made with the States for the Commonwealth to raise money to be loaned to the States, and to convert State loans.

(iii) Immigration. Provision is made for prohibiting the entrance of aliens of specified nationality and the deportation of certain persons guilty of creating industrial disturbance or of offences prejudicial to public welfare.

(iv) Navigation. Power is given to suspend certain provisions of the Navigation Act relating to coastal trade.

(v) Nationality. Definitions of British Consulate and of natural-born British subjects are amended.

(vi) Peace Officers. Power is given to appoint Peace Officers.
(vii) Commonwealth Bank (Rural Credits). Provision is made for the establishment of a Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank.

(viii) Main Roads Development. An additional sum of £750,000 is provided for development or reconditioning of main roads.

(ix) Australian War Memorial. Provision is made for an Australian War Memorial. A Board of Management is to be appointed and a fund established.

(x) Commonwealth Electoral. Provisions regarding persons entitled to enrolment and qualifications of members of House of Representatives are amended.

(xi) Customs. Conditions as to the application of the Preferential Tariff are defined.

(xii) Entertainments Tax. Rates of tax are altered.

(xiii) Invalid and Old-age Pensions. The maximum pension is raised to £53 per annum.

(xiv) Income Tax Assessment. Taxable income is further defined especially as regards the income of companies.

(xv) Income Tax. Rates for 1925-26 are declared.

(xvi) Excise Tariff Validation. Validates Excise duties introduced into Parliament on 2nd September, 1925.

(xvii) Customs Tariff Validation. Validates Tariff proposals introduced into Parliament during September, 1925.

Commonwealth Departments.

The Trade and Customs Departments of the States were transferred to the Commonwealth Government on the 1st of January, 1901, and the Defence and Post and Telegraph Departments on the 1st of March, 1901. Other departments which have been created were those of Home and Territories, the Attorney-General's Department, the Treasury, the Prime Minister's and External Affairs Department, the Works and Railways Department, the Department of Health and the Department of Markets and Migration. (The Navy and Army are now in one Department, i.e., Defence.)

**AUSTRALIA.**

*Public Debt of Australia, 30th June, 1925.*

The referendum of 13th April, 1910, gave power to the Commonwealth, at any time to assume all the State debts existing at that time, but, so far, this power has not been exercised. The distinction which formerly existed between the debts which could be taken over under the Constitution, and those which could not, consequently exists no longer. The following table shows the complete indebtedness of the States and Commonwealth at 30th June, 1925. From the total amount shown below there must be deducted £71,135,473 representing loans which have been counted as part of the Commonwealth and also of the State Public Debts. The net Public Debt of Australia at 30th June, 1925, was thus £965,870,844.

NEW SOUTH WALES.

Boundaries and Area.

The State of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 154th meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the State of Victoria, it is bounded by a surveyed and marked line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the State follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards the southern bank of Murray, into which the first-named stream merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the State is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the State follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary, the Dumaresq; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dumaresq. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area of New South Wales is 310,372 square miles (inclusive of Federal Territory—940 square miles and Lord Howe Island, a dependency of New South Wales, 5 square miles), or 198,638,000 acres, being a little over two and a half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area is 195,669,000 acres, or about 305,733 square miles.

The length of the State, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 683 miles, the length of the seaboard is 907 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 756 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 860 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' 41" S. lat., and 151° 12' 23" E. long.

Of the total area of the State, 63,096,007 acres have been alienated, or were in process of alienation on the 30th June, 1926.

The number of alienated holdings over one acre in extent used for agricultural and pastoral purposes during the last year for which returns were compiled are:

In addition, there are 6,992 Holdings embracing 35,907,736 acres of Crown Lands only.

History.

The name "New South Wales" was given to the eastern part of Australia on its discovery by Captain Cook in 1770, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, at Port Jackson, under Captain Phillip, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The Merino sheep was introduced in 1797, but progress for a time was slow because a passage over the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. The population in 1800 was about 5,200. At the first census in 1828 the total population was only 36,598, but it increased rapidly thereafter, and the discovery of gold in 1851 brought much population to the State. Responsible government was established in 1856, and the next thirty years was a time of remarkable prosperity and progress. On the 1st January, 1901, the Colony of New South Wales united with the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, into a close political federation known as the Commonwealth of Australia. This, the second outstanding political event, was followed by a further period of phenomenal prosperity and progress which lasted until the outbreak of the European war in 1914. Then the extraordinary overseas demand for the staple products, which increased as the war continued, enhanced the value of local production, and the critical period which followed the post-war trade boom passed without any economic disorder.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean in shade is 42° 6', to Bourke, 67° 0'. On the coast it varies from 64° 7" in the southern portion to 67° 8" in the northern districts, Sydney being 63° 4". On the mountains snow lies in a few places all the winter. On the table lands the mean annual temperature is somewhat lower than in the coastal districts, where the winter is milder.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The average rainfall of Sydney is about 48 inches annually, the average annual number of days on which rain falls is 157.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.
Trade and Industry.

The staple products of New South Wales are wool and wheat.

In 1925 the cable messages sent from New South Wales numbered 320,600 and 310,543 were received. The amount collected for cable messages was £80,312.

Of inland rivers the Murray, Darling, Murrumbidgees, and Lachlan are navigable most of the year for small river craft, and nearly all the coast rivers are navigable for varying distances by ocean-going steamers, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, the Macleay, the Manning, the Hunter and the Hawkesbury, while Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are large natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but communication with Europe is chiefly by the vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Marseilles and via Capetown), the Orient Royal Mail lines (via Suez and Naples), the Australian Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers (via Suez), the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles), Canadian Australasian line (via Vancouver), Oceanic line (via San Francisco), the Union S.S. Company of New Zealand (via San Francisco), White Star and Aberdeen lines (via Durban and Capetown), Scottish Shire line (via Suez), Blue Funnel line (via South Africa), the New Zealand Shipping Line (via Panama), Canadian Government line (via Vancouver and Montreal), The Clan line; Cunard line; Commonwealth and Dominion line; Federal Steam Navigation Co.; Ellerman and Bucknall line; Holland-Australia line; Swedish-Australia line; Norwegian-Australia line; German-Australian line; North German Lloyd; Lloyd Sabaudo line. Five or six mails are sent to and despatched from England monthly.

Letters from England reach Sydney in about 31 days.

The number of articles passing through the Post Offices in 1924-25 was:

- Letters and Postcards ... 296,399,293
- Newspapers ... 72,711,100
- Packets and Book Parcels ... 51,198,200

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Public Instruction Act of 1890. Teachers in State schools belong to the Public Service and are paid fixed salaries according to their qualifications and the classifications of their schools. Education is free and compulsory between the ages of 7 and 14 years.

At the close of 1926 there were 3,216 State schools divided into 30 high schools, 8 for boys, 5 for girls and 17 mixed; central junior technical schools, 2; public schools, 1,961; provisionalschools, 547; half-time schools, 86; travelling schools, 1; correspondence schools, 1; evening continuation schools, 54; subsidised schools, 631; and industrial and reformatory schools, 3. School buildings are erected and maintained wholly at the expense of the Government.

State aid to denominational schools ceased many years ago, but general religious instruction is imparted by the State teachers, and for limited periods with the consent of parents by ministers of religion. Children are conveyed to central schools, and in very thinly-populated remote districts subsidies are paid either to families who combine and engage teachers, or to single families of 2 children and upwards: in the latter case it may take the form of assisting to board the children near existing schools. A properly equipped travelling school conveys a means of instruction to several outlying groups in rotation. As a further means of providing facilities for the education of children of isolated families correspondence schools have also been organised. All children are carried free by rail to the nearest school, while conveyances are subsidised by the Department to carry pupils residing in an outlying district to a Central School.

The "Bursary Endowment Act," passed in 1912, provides for the establishment of a fund for Bursaries tenable in public or private secondary schools and in the Sydney University and for
the constitution of a Bursary Endowment Board. About three hundred Bursaries, each tenable for four or five years at a High or District School, and carrying a monetary grant ranging from £2. to £50. per annum, are awarded annually. Provision is made for the supply of necessary text books to all pupils by the Department free of cost to the pupil. Agricultural Scholarships, Technical Scholarships and thirty University Bursaries are also awarded annually. A Higher Education Scheme has been established which provides for (a) higher primary education in Superior Public Schools which are of three types (commercial and junior technical for boys and domestic for girls), and (b) High School education of several types (general, commercial, technical and agricultural), in High Schools. There are also District Rural Schools, which provide elementary agricultural instruction. Intermediate Certificates are issued on the satisfactory completion of a three years' High School course, and leaving Certificates (equivalent in prescribed subjects, to the University Matriculation Certificates) are awarded on the satisfactory completion of a five years' High School course. Twenty-eight High Schools and two Agricultural High Schools are in operation. At the end of 1925, 792 students were undergoing courses of training, covering two years or more, at the Teachers' College, a large training establishment within the University Grounds. In addition, 250 students were receiving a short (12 months') course of training preparatory to taking charge of small bush State Schools, or of receiving appointments as assistants in country schools.

Evening Continuation Schools have been brought into operation in city and country centres divided into the following classes: (1) Junior Technical Schools; (2) Commercial Schools—in both cases the object being to assist lads to push on more rapidly in the callings they have chosen; and (3) Domestic Schools, for girls only.

For the year 1925 the net cost to the State of public instruction was £4,142,012., exclusive of £196,506., expended on technical education.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1850. Its State endowment was originally £5,000., and from 1890 to 1892 was £13,900., but it has recently been increased to £32,000. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The State endowment and special grants for 1924-25 amounted to £121,670. Four denominational colleges are affiliated to the University. In addition, there is the women's college, also affiliated. During the year 1924-25, the total State endowment amounted to £6,500. Of this sum, £4,000. was devoted to defraying the cost of building extensions. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, engineering, agriculture, veterinary science and dentistry. Recently, several faculties have been added to its curriculum. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, with an enrolment of 695 pupils, and having a State endowment of £1,500. There are also technical colleges, under the Department of Public Instruction, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns. The Central College—a large establishment—is extensively equipped and staffed for trades, professional, and scientific instruction. The fees are within the reach of all, and the colleges are open to males and females alike. There is an Australian Museum, a National Art Gallery, a Public Library, including the Mitchell Library, with endowments of £1,000., £2,000., and £2,000. respectively, a State Conservatorium of Music and a Music Library. Public libraries and schools of arts are established throughout the State and obtain Government subsidies. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, a Historical, a Geographical, and two Art Societies, a Government Observatory, Agricultural and Forestry Museum, and a Mining and Geological, and Technological Museums, Government Agricultural Colleges, Experimental Farms, with many other educational associations.

Local Government.

In New South Wales the greater portion of the State has been incorporated, leaving only the "Western Division" which is but sparsely settled, outside the scope of local government. Even in that division, however, several towns have been established as Municipalities.

The area incorporated comprises 183,977 square miles out of a total area of 309,430 square miles in the State (i.e., exclusive of Lord Howe Island and the Federal Capital Territory of Canberra and Jervis Bay).

The local government of this large area, with the exception of the City of Sydney, is provided for under the Local Government Act, 1919, which came into force on 1st January, 1920, and was amended by the Local Government (Amendment) Act, 1920, the Local Government (Validation and Amendment) Act, 1922, the Main Roads Act, 1924, the Local Government (County Councils) Amendment Act, 1924, and the Local Government (Amendment) Act, 1924.

The City of Sydney was first incorporated in 1842, being the first town in the State to be granted municipal government, but it has, since its incorporation, been governed under special Acts applying to it alone.

The first Act to provide for general municipal government was passed in 1858. This Act was superseded by the Municipalities Act, 1867, and this in its turn was replaced by the Municipalities Act, 1897.

These Acts made provision for the incorporation of towns only, but in 1906 an Act was passed—the Shires Act, 1906—to provide for the division of the whole of the Eastern and Central Divisions of the State, outside the towns incorporated under the Municipalities Acts into Shires, thus providing for local government for the first time throughout the greater part of the State.

In the following year, the Shires Act, together with the Municipalities Act, 1897, and an Act passed in 1906 for the extension of local government—the Local Government Extension Act, 1906—were consolidated in the Local Government Act, 1906. That Act which came into general operation on the 1st January, 1907 (although the rating provisions as applying to Municipalities did not commence until the following year), marks the commencement of the system of local government which is still in force.

It was amended in several of its details in the years which followed its enactment, and was ultimately repealed and consolidated with other Local Government Acts like the Impounding Act, 1898, and the Country Towns Water and Sewerage Acts, by the Local Government Act, 1919, which did not, however, alter the system of local government previously in operation, but merely improved and extended it, and most of the provisions of the old Acts are preserved unaltered or in a slightly altered and improved form.
There are two types of local government provided for, viz.—Shires and Municipalities—the former comprising country districts (sometimes of great extent, the largest being the Shire of Lachlan containing 5,736 square miles) and the latter the larger towns. There are now (October, 1926) 136 Shires and 179 Municipalities in the State. As regards town areas in Shires, a Shire Council may (subject to the Governor's approval and if a majority of the electors concerned do not veto the proposal at a poll which may be taken on a petition signed by not less than 100 of such electors) acquire the right to exercise the powers of a Council of a Municipality in any such area by having the area declared by Proclamation of the Governor to be an "Urban Area," without the expensive machinery of a separate municipal government having to be set up. Provision is also made for the continuance as cities of all towns so proclaimed before the Act came into force, and for the proclamation of any municipality as a city, if it fulfils the requirements laid down by the new Act. Cities, however, have no further powers than Municipalities, and are treated as Municipalities under the Act in all respects except as to name.

The franchise by which Councils were elected under the Local Government Act, 1906, remains unchanged in its main features although several alterations have been made in detail, that is to say, speaking broadly, that any natural-born or naturalised British subject, male or female, who is an occupier, owner, or ratepaying lessee of rateable land in a Shire or Municipality, is entitled to enrolment as an elector. Councils consist of not less than 6 and not more than 9 Councillors in the case of Shires and not less than 6 nor more than 15 Aldermen in the case of Municipalities. Any person whose name is on a roll of electors is eligible for election as a Councillor or Alderman, except in certain cases where disqualification is provided for, the most important of which is on account of business or financial relations with the Council.

Each Shire is divided into Ridings, and a Municipality may be divided into Wards or may exist as an undivided area, but Ridings and Wards must be represented by an equal number of Councillors or Aldermen, as the case may be. Provision is made for the election of Urban Committees of three persons to manage the affairs of Urban Areas in Shires where such have been created. General elections of Councillors and Aldermen take place every three years, the next election being due to be held on 1st December, 1928, and it is further provided that in any Shire and Municipality elections may, if the electors so decide at a poll taken upon a petition of one-fifth of their number, be held according to the principles of proportional representation.

The functions of Shire and Municipal Councils include the control of roads, bridges, public watering places for stock, wharves and jetties, the lighting of streets, the regulation of traffic, the removal and disposal of nightsoil and garbage, the provision of water supplies and of sewerage services, the regulation and licensing of public vehicles, the control and management of parks and recreation grounds, etc.

A complete list of the many other powers given to Councils under the Act would take up too much space to enumerate. It will suffice to mention the following as indicating the wide range of such powers—the formation of Civil ambulance brigades and the provision of temporary hospitals, infant's milk depots, and maternity and infant welfare centres, the regulation of boarding houses and lodging houses, elementary town planning, the establishment and maintenance or subsidising of public libraries, the establishment of sports grounds, the provision and regulation of places of public recreation and amusement, the provision of baths and the regulation of bathing, trading in the direction only of public services such as gas, electricity, ferries, motor bus services, motor lorries for transport of wool, etc., and the supply of ice, sand, stone, gravel, pipes, and flagstones, the control of burials, the establishment of markets, resumption of land for subsequent sale to the public, housing of workmen and the erection and sale, on extended terms of payment, of dwellings generally and of shops and other buildings, and the regulation of the picking of wild flowers. Councils are also empowered to grant franchises to private individuals and companies for the manufacture and supply of gas or electricity or the provision of railways in public places for the purpose of any business other than the carriage of goods or passengers. The granting of such franchises is, however, subject to the Governor's approval and to Parliament raising no objection.

To provide the revenue for carrying out its powers a Council is empowered to levy a general rate of not less than 1d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of all rateable land in its area. Where, however, a general rate of 1d. is more than sufficient in any year to meet the requirements of a Council, the Governor is empowered to authorise the levying of a rate less than that sum.

In addition to the general rate Councils are empowered to levy special rates for special works, local rates for works of benefit to a portion of the area only, and loan rates for the repayment of loans. In the case of these rates ratepayers may petition for a poll to be taken as to whether the rate shall be levied on the Unimproved Capital Value or the Improved Capital Value of the land subject to it.

The amount of rates which a Council may levy is limited as follows, but provision is made that the Governor may grant permission to exceed these limits in special cases.

**Shires.**—General rates—2d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of all rateable land in the Shire.

Rates in Urban Areas other than general, and water and sewerage local rates—2s. in the £ on the assessed annual value of all rateable land in the Urban Area.

**Municipalities.**—General rates—a sum equal to 2d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value and 1s 6d. in the £ on the assessed Annual Value of all rateable land in the area; provided that a general rate of more than 3d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value shall not be levied on a mine worked for minerals other than coal and shale. All rates (other than water and sewerage local rates)—a sum of 2d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value and 2s. in the £ on the assessed Annual Value of all rateable land in the Municipality.

Water local rates are limited in both Shires and Municipalities to a sum equal to 2s. in the £ on the assessed Annual Value of all land rateable to the water rate, and sewerage local rates to a similar sum.

There are four methods provided by which Councils may borrow for carrying out the purposes of the Act, viz.:—limited overdraft, renewal loans, ordinary loans and special loans. Ratepayers may
petition for a poll of ratepayers to be taken as to whether a special loan shall be raised, as well as to whether the loan rate shall be on the Unimproved or Improved Capital Value.

It is compulsory to levy loan rates for the repayment of renewal, ordinary, and special loans, except in certain circumstances, and except in the case of special loans raised by Shire councils. The total borrowings of a Municipal Council are limited to twenty per cent. of the Unimproved Capital Value of all ratable land in the area, and special loans by Shire Councils must not in the aggregate exceed thrice the amount of the income of the Shire.

To assist Shire Councils it is provided that out of the Consolidated Revenue a sum of not less than £150,000. shall be distributed each year among Shire Councils by way of endowment, according to an apportionment made by the Governor every three years. Special grants and loans for works are also made by the Government each year to both Shires and Municipal Councils, the amount paid to Shires in the year ended 30th June, 1926, being £314,329L (special grants £184,959L., loans £129,370L.), and to Municipalities £25,650L. (special grants £8,955L., loans £16,695L.).

In addition to what has been stated above as to a Council's powers, some novel features which have been introduced by the Act of 1919 may be mentioned. These include the formation of groups of whole or parts of Shires and Municipalities—the groups being called "County Districts"—in order to carry out more effectively such functions of the Councils of the areas included, as the destruction of aquatic plants like water hyacinth, the growth of which in some districts has been found to render rivers unnavigable until the river is cleared and the plant destroyed; the prevention of river bank erosion or of floods; or any other function which would be a matter of concern to the district in which such Shires or Municipalities are situated. The Act provides for each "County District" to be administered by a "County Council" composed of delegates elected by the Council of each Shire or Municipality included in the district. The functions of a County Council are limited to the powers specially delegated to it by the Governor. The other powers of the Shire or Municipal Councils of the district will not be interfered with in any way. Four "County Districts" have so far been proclaimed.

Difficulty has been experienced in the past in many Shires and Municipalities in getting Councils to carry out works like the making of a new road or bridge desired by the residents of a particular Riding or Ward, and the 1919 Act accordingly provides that in circumstances like that, upon a petition signed by all the Councillors or Aldermen representing the Riding or Ward, or by at least one-fifth of the ratepayers of the Riding or Ward, the Council shall take a poll of ratepayers of that Riding or Ward, and, if such poll is favorable, shall carry out the work the people want and levy a local rate to provide repayment therefor.

It is also provided in the Act that a Council may at any time take a poll of electors or ratepayers on any question arising out of the administration of the Act, and any question of importance may be thus referred to the people themselves for decision.

The provisions of the law now in force mentioned above will serve to indicate the democratic character of the new Local Government Act, which has been designed as far as possible to secure that local government shall be something more than a name, without, however, taking away the powers of the Central Government in all such matters as are necessary to conserve the authority of the State and promote the common good. Special legislation is in contemplation respecting town planning, advertisement hoardings, protection of native flora and other matters relating to local government.

In November, 1924, an Act was passed (Main Roads Act, 1924), under the provisions of which a Main Roads Board was constituted. The Board is charged with the duty of assisting Councils in the work of constructing a well-organised system of main highways with the primary object of developing the vacant lands of the State and feeding the railway lines with traffic, of giving the settlers access to wharf or rail and of providing facilities for modern motor traffic. It is estimated that a sum of approximately £10,000,000 consisting of Government subsidies, contributions by Councils and the proceeds of motor taxation will be at the disposal of the Main Roads Board for expenditure during the first five years. The State Government has definitely recognised the principle that the proceeds of motor taxation should be earmarked for expenditure on main roads by making provision in the Main Roads Act for the handing over of the proceeds of such taxation, less cost of collection, to the Main Roads Board.

The Local Government (County Councils) Amendment Act, 1924, was passed with the object of assisting in the constitution of a very large County District to be comprised of forty-two municipalities and shires in the northern part of the State for the purpose of carrying out the Jackadgery Hydro-electric Scheme. Under the previously existing provisions of the Local Government Act the Council of such a County District would need to have forty-two members and would have been unwieldy. This Act made provision for a number of the areas to be grouped together in one electorate and for the whole group to be represented on the County Council by one delegate instead of one for each shire and municipality included in the group.

The main object of the Local Government (Amendment) Act, 1924, was to amend the valuation provisions of the Local Government Act so as to give Councils and Shires other than any Shire wholly or partly within the County of Cumberland or the Blue Mountains Shire (i.e., those Shires situated in proximity to the City of Sydney) the right of adopting for the purpose of rating either the valuations supplied by the Valuer General under the Valuation of Land Act, 1916, or valuations made by their own valuers made under Schedule III. of the Local Government Act, 1919. Parts V. and VI. of the Valuation of Land Act relating to the use of the valuations of the Valuer General by Shire and Municipal Councils and by Government Departments do not come into operation in any Shire or Municipality until a date specified by proclamation in the Government Gazette. Until such proclamation was issued a Council had to make its own valuations under the Local Government Act, but when parts V. and VI. of the Valuation of Land Act were applied to an area, and the Governor was satisfied that a valuation list (i.e., a list containing valuations of all lands in an area) had been supplied to the Council he issued a proclamation that this valuation list had been so furnished and thereupon the valuation provisions of the Local Government Act ceased to apply and
the Council concerned had to use the valuations supplied by the Valuer General for the purpose of levying rates.

Since the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme was commenced the local government works and services in the irrigation areas have been the responsibility of the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission. A Royal Commission recommended that the Yanko irrigation areas be constituted as a Shire but that the Griffith areas be not constituted as a Shire until the end of 1928. These questions are at the present being considered by the Government.

**Constitution.**

The first Legislative Council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers on H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council were appointed for five years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council at present consists of 97 members, who are not paid, with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry. All members are privileged to travel free over all Government Railways and Tramways.

The Legislative Assembly has varied from time to time in its numbers and method of election. The property qualification and plural voting were abolished in 1893. The franchise was extended to women in 1902.

The electoral franchise is held by male and female adults, who are natural born or naturalised subjects of the King, and absolutely free, with a residential qualification, which requires residence for a continuous period of six months in the Commonwealth of Australia, three months in the State of New South Wales, and one month in the electoral district for which enrolment is claimed, subject to disqualification for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc.

The Parliamentary Elections Act, 1911, provided that an elector absent from the district for which he or she is enrolled may vote for that district at any polling place in any other electorate, and extended the franchise to members of the Naval and Military service.

The electoral Acts were consolidated in 1912.

On 18th December, 1918, an Act was assented to providing for the election of members of the Legislative Assembly at General Elections in accordance with the principles of Proportional Representation; for postal voting in cases where an elector throughout the hours of polling is not within 15 miles of a polling place, or is travelling under conditions which preclude him from attending a booth; or where an elector through serious illness or infirmity, or, in the case of a woman by approaching maternity, was precluded from attending a booth.

The State is subdivided into 24 districts, 9 of which are 5-seat districts and 15 are 3-seat districts.

On 10th December, 1920, an Act was assented to providing for the filling of casual vacancies by the election of the unsuccessful candidate at the last General Election who represents the same party interests as the late member, and who, upon the count of the primary preference votes, was highest on the list as disclosed by such count as between the unsuccessful candidates representing such party interests who are willing to be elected and available to fill the vacancy.

On the 28th December, 1921, an Act was assented to whereby full compulsory expression of preferences was abolished in favour of compulsion to the extent of the number of seats to be filled.

It provides for compulsory enrolment and also that an elector's name is not to be removed on objection unless and until it is proved that he has left the Electoral District. Further, that an elector who has transferred to another polling place area in the same district is not to be removed from the roll until his enrolment is effected for the new polling place area, and in connection with the Supplemental Rolls the Registrar's or Deputy Registrar's card of acknowledgment of receipt of application for enrolment of transfer enables the holder to exercise his vote (if by some mischance his name does not appear on the Supplemental Roll) on making a declaration.

The interval between the issue of the writ and the taking of the poll was extended from the 28th day to a day not later than the fortieth day after the date of the issue of the writ.

The polling hours were fixed from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and nomination papers are now required to be signed by six electors instead of one hundred.

On 17th March, 1926, an Act was assented to, which provides for a redistribution of the State into ninety single seat electorates and for the repeal of the system of proportional representation upon completion of the redistribution and the preparation of the rolls.

The repeal of the Casual Vacancies Acts was also provided for, to take effect upon the issue of the writs for the first General Election on the basis of single seat electorates, and from that date casual vacancies are to be filled by the holding of by-elections.

The duration of the Assembly is three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time.

The amount paid to members was increased from £600 per annum to £875 per annum as from 1st July, 1925.

Members may also travel free over the Government railways and tramways in the State, and are provided with official stamped envelopes for the transmission of correspondence through the post.

### LORD HOWE ISLAND

Latitude, 31° 30' S. Longitude 159° 5' E.

This island lies 436 miles north-east from Sydney, and 300 miles from Port Macquarie, the nearest part of the Australian continent.

It was discovered on February 17th, 1788, by Lieutenant H. L. Ball, of H.M.S. "Supply," while on his way from Port Jackson to found a settlement at Norfolk Island. It is of volcanic origin and crescent shaped, about seven miles in length and from one-half to one-and-three-quarters in width, containing about 3,220 acres. It is of great beauty throughout and covered with a dense and most luxuriant vegetation, but from the peculiar bouldery character of the formation of the major part of its floor, it has scarcely more than 300 acres suitable for agriculture. The soil of these few acres is extremely rich, and will produce almost any sub-tropical vegetation.

No lands have been sold, and the people pay no rent, occupying the land upon sufferance only—the Government reserving the right of resuming whenever they may see fit.

The population numbers 120 souls. Very fair and comfortable accommodation can be obtained amongst the settlers. The natural beauties of the island render it most attractive to visitors. Tourists are visiting this beautiful island in largely increasing numbers. Fish are very plentiful, and good sport can consequently be had. There is a monthly steam service to the island under the agency of Burns, Philp and Co.

The Island is a dependency of New South Wales and the Government of New South Wales have appointed a Board of Control consisting of the Hon. J. C. L. Fitzpatrick, M.L.A., Chairman; E. B. Harkness, Esquire, C.M.G. (Under-Secretary, Chief Secretary's Office, &c.); and Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith, &c. (Director, Botanic Gardens, &c.). Members: S. L. Anderson, Chief Secretary's Office, Sydney, Secretary. The Board take charge of the affairs of the Island, and the management and control of the Kentia palm seed industry. Lord Howe Island is the home of the Kentia palms, the hardiest and most beautiful palms in the world, and their seeds are collected and sold under the Board's direction. Hundreds of bushels of these seeds are shipped annually to all parts of the world.
QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger passing Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, and embracing the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, terminates on the boundary of the Northern Territory, in lat. 10° 40', Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Morotan, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 670,500 square miles, or 429,120,000 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

Early History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters or ranchers, as they are termed in America, began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the time of the proclamation declaring the Colony distinct.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 67°9', the extreme range during 1923 being from 37°1' to 105°7'. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the total for year at Brisbane was about 53,082 inches in 138 wet days; mean barometer 29°99'.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and continues its course northerly to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Sugar growing is a very important industry. In 1925 there were 269,509 acres under cane, of which the crops on 189,466 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 3,668,252 tons of cane, which produced 486,585 tons of sugar at 94% net titre.

Maize was grown on 154,252 acres, and returned a yield of 3,384,172 bushels, but the local demand is so great that practically none is sent out of the State.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1925, 96 acres yielded 103,523 lbs. of cured leaf.

The cultivation of cotton is now being undertaken on a large scale, and during 1925, 53,363 acres were under this crop of which 40,062 acres produced 19,537,274 lbs. of unginned cotton.

*In 1925 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 568 acres, which yielded 7,842 tons of tuber. A small proportion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Amongst other fruits, bananas occupied 14,766 acres with a production of 2,582,784 bunches of fruit. Pineapples, 3,995 acres, with 902,636 dozen. Oranges, 3,756 (bearing, 1,171 not bearing) acres, with 281,862 bushels. The total value of all crops for 1925 was 12,562,609.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, sparsely timbered but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, most of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. There is every prospect of the area of cultivation extending to the Burnett District and further west in the

*Outside Australia there are restrictions as to the term "Arrowroot." Although it is admitted that the product in Queensland—derived from "Canna Edulis"—meets all requirements, yet the term "Arrowroot" having been acquired by virtue of many years of trading, dealing with the product of another plant, namely "Maranta Arundinacea," the Queensland product has been practically prevented from entering the English market without such qualifications on the package as would prevent sale and exportation outside the Commonwealth.
near future. In 1925, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 10,614 acres were mown for hay, and 165,999 acres yielded 1,973,477 bushels of grain.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,897 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 183,918,080 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 82,469,364 acres are leased as grazing farms, homesteads, and 32,087,000 under occupation licence. Number of horses, 638,372; cattle, 6,436,645; sheep, 20,663,323; swine, 199,598.

Wool produced, 1924-25, expressed as greasy, 140,862,641 lbs., value £15,553,572.

The chief exports overseas of home production were:

Goods sent to other States of Australia are not now counted as exports.

In some items the details given are of practically no value. Notably gold, green fruit, sugar, etc., and a goodly proportion of other primary products which, being transhipped in other States, are not now counted to Queensland in official statements.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery, oils, etc. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Straits Settlements, Egypt, Papua, Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, India, China, Norway, Sweden, Java, Sumatra, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important in the State. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mount Morgan mine—Gympie, Chillagoe, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in over twenty-six districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total production of gold during 1925 amounted to 46,406 fine ozs., value £197,118.

Many other minerals are worked in the State. The principal of which and their value for 1925 were:

**Tin.**—£161,500.—Chief centres of production: Chillagoe, Cooktown, Herberton, Kangaroo Hills, and Stanthorpe.

**Silver.**—£53,003.—Chief centres: Brisbane, Charters Towers, Chillagoe, Croydon, Etheridge, Gympie, Herberton, Mt. Morgan and Stanthorpe.

**Copper.**—£254,074.—Chief centres of production: Chillagoe, Cloncurry, Etheridge, Gladstone, Herberton, Mt. Morgan, Mt. Perry and Ravenswood.

**Lead.**—£187,681.—Chief centres: Brisbane, Burketown, Chillagoe, Cloncurry, Etheridge, Herberton and Stanthorpe.

**Limestone.**—£38,091.—Chief centres: Chillagoe, Gladstone, Gympie, Rockhampton, Stanthorpe and Townsville.

**Arsenic.**—£11,150, mainly from Stanthorpe.

Total value of minerals other than gold, £1,815,559. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1925 being of the value of opal £1,000., whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area, £4,573. (Gems.) At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burram and Peak Downs, the Dawson Valley and the Darling Downs, and at Bowen and Mount Mulligan, N.Q., whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1925 was 1,177,173 tons, valued at £1,037,966.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the State is popularly divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbutt, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, crow's ash, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: Red Cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Bean tree, Kauri pine, Cypress pine, the pine, Silky oak, Satin wood, Maple, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—
Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia piulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus is used largely as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1925, 231 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 27,725.

Water Supply.

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State, of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1925 an indebtedness to the Government of £2,634,934l.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 670,500 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 4,167 artesian bores have been sunk with an aggregate depth of 711'28 miles; the depth ranges from a maximum of 7,000 feet, the depth of the bore at Springleigh; 1,343 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 1,407,880 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 301,333,800 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 270 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 230° to 78° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at about three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, so that not far short of a million sterling represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands. Irrigation has made a start in the State, and 21,669 acres were artificially watered last year. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but vegetables, fruit, Lucerne and green fodder and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51'20 per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population to be 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,919 females. The census of 3rd April, 1911, showed that there were 329,506 males and 276,307 females, making a total of 605,813, exclusive of 8,687 aborigines. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage.

The figures for 1911 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions. Population of State 30th June, 1926, 879,396.

CENSUS, 4th April, 1921.

|                | M.     | F.     | P.     |

| Other Asiatics| 2,129  | 362    | 2,491  |
| Half-caste Aborigines | 1,617 | 1,460 | 3,077 |

Practically the whole of the State is divided into local authority areas a few islands only being excluded, occupied by a population of about 1,500 persons. The receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1925 were £4,679,314l.; their expenditure £5,604,443l.; the assessed rateable value of the property in districts under their control £73,940,405l., excluding cost of construction of waterworks (£5,181,665l.), and sewerage £3,404,827l., and liabilities £12,700,924l. Liabilities for water works, amounting to £7,837,287l., which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given; assets, £13,352,461l.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, at the Census on 4th April, 1921, a population of 210,032 (ten mile radius). The City of Brisbane now consists of an area of 385 sq. miles and the estimated population on 31st December, 1925, was 263,711. It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy, and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (27,500), Ipswich (20,526), Maryborough (10,635), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (25,000), Gympie (8,769), Toowoomba (23,394), Charters Towers (9,499), Bundaberg (9,500), and Mt. Morgan (7,214).

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 30th June, 1926, 13 banks (exclusive of the Commonwealth Bank), with 419 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £1,930,574l.; deposits, £31,972,696l.; assets, £34,952,693l.; liabilities, £33,104,358l.

The Commonwealth Savings Bank, Queensland Branch, had on 31st Dec., 1925:

- No of Depositors ... 409,720
- Value of Deposits ... £21,909,458l.
- Average Value of each A/c. 53l. 9s. 6d.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling. The Commonwealth has also silver coin in circulation and British coin is being gradually withdrawn, but some years will elapse before local coin is exclusively in use.
Means of Communication.

Queensland is divided for the purpose of Railway administration into three divisional railway systems, Southern, Central and Northern, each in charge of General Managers, subject to the control of the Commissioner at Brisbane. On 30th June, 1926, there were 6,210 miles of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge and 30 miles of 2 ft. gauge Government Railway lines open for traffic, being the longest mileage of railway in any Australian State. In addition there are 134 miles of Railways and Tramways of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge owned by private companies or Local Authorities, which are either worked by the Commissioner or are subject to his inspection.

On 30th June, 1926, there were 311 miles of Railway under construction, exclusive of 123 miles on which work is temporarily suspended. The mileage of Lines authorised by Parliament but not yet commenced, is 1,165.

The rolling stock consists of 726 engines, 972 carriages, 17,701 wagons and 213 brake vans.

From Brisbane main trunk lines run west and north. The former crosses the Main Range (2,000 ft. high) and shortly after passing Toowoomba at the entrance to the Darling Downs, 101 miles from Brisbane, bifurcates, one arm proceeding due west through pastoral and wheat growing country until it reaches Cunnamulla (604 miles from Brisbane), the other crosses the famous agricultural Darling Downs and then passing through the granite district of Stanthorpe, in which are many flourishing fruit orchards, terminates at Wallangarra on the New South Wales border (223 miles from Brisbane).

Off the southern and western Lines there are 19 local Branches, with a total length of 648 miles. From Westgate (13 miles south of Charleville) the Great Western Railway links up with the main system, and is open to traffic to Quilpie, (125 miles). The South Western Railway joins the Southern system at Warwick and terminates at Dirranbandi (257 miles).

Within a radius of 100 miles from Brisbane there are 15 branch lines of 399 miles in length serving the suburban areas, seaside resorts, and rich agricultural and heavily timbered districts. One of these lines running due south meets the New South Wales border at Tweed Heads, 69 miles from Brisbane.

Between Brisbane and Rockhampton are 13 branches (totaling 545 miles) serving agricultural, mineral and sugar lands, and heavily timbered districts.

From Rannes (on the Mount Morgan Branch) Many Peaks (on the Boyne Valley Branch) and Mundubbera (on the Gayndah Branch) three branches converging on a central point at Monto are being constructed in connection with the Northern Burnett Scheme of land settlement. The total length of these three lines will be 219 miles, of which 74 miles is open for public traffic. Another extension of the Mount Morgan Branch from Baralaba to Castle Creek, 55 miles (45 miles is now open), is being constructed to serve an irrigation scheme on the Dawson River Valley.

The Central Line extends from the town of Rockhampton due west to Morella, 469 miles, passing through pastoral country, with 8 branches of 532 miles of line into agricultural, pastoral and mineral areas (including the Blair Athol Coalfield where the seam is 90 feet thick), and to the ports of Broadmount on the Fitzroy River, some 36 miles below the city wharves, and Port Alma, 37 miles south-east from Rockhampton.

From the port of Mackay, a short Line run through the sugar growing country east of the Eungella Range, to Netherdale, 45 miles, with three small Branches, running north and south, a distance of 23 miles, into sugar country. In this district there are over 200 miles of light tramways into the sugar plantations and mills.

From Merinda (4 miles from the port of Bowen) a branch 49 miles in length has recently been opened to the extensive Bowen Coalfield from which all coal supplies for the Townsville Railway system are now obtained instead of being sea-borne from the south. Shipping requirements can also be supplied from this field.

The Great Northern Railway which commences at the port of Townsville, 828 miles north of Brisbane, runs through the well known mining town of Charters Towers, 83 miles from the Port, and from Hughenden (236 miles) continues due west for over 200 miles through Northern Downs, pastured with millions of sheep, to the rich copper mining district of Cloncurry, 481 miles, thence with a southerly sweep to Selwyn, 72 miles from Cloncurry, passing through Malbon, where it bifurcates to the mining districts of Hampden, Mt. Elliott and the Dukeless, eventually reaching Dajarra, a distance of 582 miles from Townsville. From this point the line to Moonah Creek, 41 miles in the direction of Camooweal, is partially constructed. North from Cloncurry another line, 86 miles in length, has been built to serve the Mt. Cuthbert and Dobbyn mineral districts. At Hughenden a line runs south-west to Winton, a distance of 132 miles, through fine pastoral country. At 64 miles from Townsville, another Branch runs south to the town of Ravenswood, once a flourishing mineral township.

The main systems are now joined up by the North Coast Railway as far North as Cairns, completing the link between Brisbane and Cairns (1,040 miles). This line passes through Gympie, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Mackay, Bowen, Townsville, Ingham, and Innisfail, and links up these towns with the Australian Capital Cities.

In the far north from the port of Cairns, a line of Railway runs west over the Barron Ranges, past the famous Barron Falls, through some of the most picturesque tropical scenery of the world, through the wonderful timber scrub of Atherton, the mineral township of Herberton, to the rich table land at the heads of the Herbert and Johnstone Rivers. A Branch Line joining the Main Line 64 miles from Cairns runs along the Johnstone River through rich scrub lands to Millaa Millaa, 37 miles. At Mareeba, 46 miles from the Port, the line purchased from the Chillagoe Company junctions with the Cairns Railway. This line runs to Mungana, a distance of 103 miles, and 75 miles from this junction, another line 142 miles in length, serves the rich mineral fields of the Etheridge, whilst from Dimbulah another line of 30 miles taps the coal fields of Mt. Mulligan.

From Cooktown, the furthest Northern port on the Eastern Coast, a railway runs to Laura, a distance of 67 miles.

From Normanton in the Gulf country a railway runs to the mineral town of Croydon, a distance of 94 miles.
**Education.**

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict., No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1925 there were in operation 1,707 State Schools, with an average attendance of 106,994 pupils. Of these 13, with 97 teachers and 1,423 scholars, were High Schools. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 171 private schools, with average attendance of 21,694 children, and 10 grammar schools, with average attendance 1,650 pupils on the roll. A University is now established with 11 professors, 42 lecturers, including 3 assistant lecturers and demonstrators, and 20 miscellaneous assistants, enrolment 487. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

**Immigration.**

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 93,979, and the departures to all countries 80,426, showing an excess of arrivals of 13,553.

**Government.**

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of one House of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly. The members are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in the Legislature. The voting for members is by ballot. The Elections Act Amendment Act of 1906 provides for male and female adult franchise on residential qualification only, a twelve months' continuous residence in the State being the only proviso, subject to disqualifications for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc.

By the Electoral Districts Act, of 1910, the State is divided into 72 districts, each returning one member, or a total of 72 members as previously.

The Upper House, or Legislative Council, was abolished by an Act passed in 1923 (12 Geo. V. c. 32). Its members were nominated by the Governor and held office for life.

Note.—Since records of transfers of goods from other States has ceased to be kept by the Customs authorities, no credit is given to Queensland for overseas goods consumed there; this accounts for apparent drop in Customs receipts. And no credit is given to Queensland for exports that go interstate and for transhipment overseas, which constitutes a large proportion of the Total Exports.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vict., c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, was also annexed to South Australia, but was on January 1st, 1911, taken over by the Commonwealth. It is known as the Northern Territory.

Kangaroo Island (90 m. by 26 m.; area 1,500 sq. m., 1,000 ft. highest point), Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast, are included in the State.

Adelaide, the capital of the State, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

Early History.

The south coast of the State was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Stuart in 1829 explored the Murray River to its mouth.

The province was founded on the Wakefield system of colonization under Act of Parliament 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95.

The first colonists landed at Kangaroo Island, but the settlement was almost immediately transferred to the mainland where the province was proclaimed at Glenelg on December 28, 1836.

Copper was discovered at Kapunda in 1842, and at the Burra in 1845.

Responsible government was established in 1856.

Stuart reached the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Adelaide River in July, 1862, and the Northern Territory was annexed to South Australia in July, 1863.

Climate.

The rainfall at Adelaide averages 21 inches annually, mostly from May to October. It varies from 16 to 42 inches on the plains and hills respectively. The mean temperature 63°, the extreme range from 33° to 111°.

The South Australian climate is very mild and healthy. The birth rate is 21 per 1,000 of population, and the death rate only 9. The infantile mortality is about the lowest in the world, being less than 50 per 1,000 births.

General Government.

The Parliament of South Australia consists of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, created by the Local Act No. 2 of 1855-56, which was proclaimed on October 25th, 1856. This Act, commonly called the Constitution Act, was passed by virtue of the Imperial Act 13 & 14 Vict., cap. 59.

The Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as originally constituted, consisted of 18 and 36 members respectively. By the Local Act No. 27 of 1875, the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881, six members were added to the Legislative Council, and the Colony was divided into four electoral districts for the purpose of Council elections. In 1882 the House of Assembly was further increased to 52 members, representing 26 electoral districts; and by Act No. 450 of 1888, the Northern Territory was created an electoral district, returning two members, thus raising the number to 54. By Act 779 of 1901, the number of members was reduced from 31st March, 1902, to 18 in the Legislative Council and 42 (representing 13 districts) in the House of Assembly. The Northern Territory having been transferred to the Commonwealth Government, the Electoral Districts then numbered 12, returning 40 members. By Act 1148 of 1913 the Assembly Districts were altered, and now number 19, returning 46 members.

The five electoral districts of the Legislative Council are—Central No. 1, Central No. 2, Southern, Midland and Northern, each returning four members. (Vide Section 10, Act 959 of 1908, and Section 15 of 1148 of 1913). Elections are conducted by ballot. (Vide Section 21, Act 959 of 1908.)

The quorum of the Council consists of ten members, including the President.

The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the King, and that he has resided in the State for three years. The qualification of a voter is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have resided in South Australia six months. As to other qualifications, see Act 1148, 1913. Members of both houses are paid £400 per annum. The salary was increased from £300 on 1st December, 1921.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; 8 Districts returning 3 members each, and 11 Districts returning 2 members each. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be qualified and entitled to be registered as an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, a natural born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have lived in South Australia for six months. The total number of electors in 1924 for the Legislative Council was 88,161, of whom 21,766 were females, and 66,395 males, and for the House of Assembly 290,433, of whom over half are females. The session is usually from June to December.

The franchise for both Houses was extended to adult women by Act 613 of 1894.

Responsible government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature, who form the Cabinet, and are ex-officio members of the Executive Council. The ministry has a total salary of £7,750. per annum, increased from £5,000. from 1st December, 1921.

Local Government.

There are 39 municipalities in the State, whose powers are regulated by the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1890." The governing body consists
of Mayol (Lord Mayor for the City of Adelaide), Aldermen (Aldermen are at present elected for City of Adelaide and some of the Suburban Corporations only), and Councillors, elected by the ratepayers, who also elect the Auditors. The Council has power to levy rates for municipal purposes only on all house and land property within the municipal area, but the question of raising a loan must be submitted to a general meeting of the ratepayers, and a poll must be taken if demanded by six ratepayers. There are also 155 district councils having somewhat similar powers. The aggregate annual assessment of the property within the municipal areas and District Councils amounts to 7,890,423L.

**Population.**

The population of the State at the census of 1911, was 408,558 persons, and of 1921, 495,160. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are 2,500, exclusive of those living in a wild state. In 1921 there were 251 Chinese in the State. The immigration of Chinese is controlled by the Commonwealth Government under the Immigration Restriction Act, No. 17 of 1901. The population of the State on 30th June, 1926, was estimated to be 558,478.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide, including the suburbs, on 31st December, 1925, were estimated to be 303,614.

About 87 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 13 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 34 per cent.

**Production and Industry.**

It may be roughly estimated that not more than 150,000 square miles of the area of the State, are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 300 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached 1,200 miles. Forty-eight counties have been proclaimed to 31st December, 1925, embracing 84,680 square miles, or 54,194,880 acres. The area outside the declared counties covers 295,390 square miles, or 189,049,920 acres. Of the area of the State only 14,696,828 acres have been or are being alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to about 100 acres for each male adult in the State, and 121,000,000 acres are held under lease from the Crown. 3,900,000 acres are in process of alienation under systems of deferred payments. About two in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to leasing, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 20,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, etc.

Over half the total area of land cultivated is cropped with wheat (for grain, hay and fodder), of which 2,964,663 acres were cultivated in 1922-27. The total area under cultivation is about 5,500,000 acres. The following are the average yields of the main crops grown:—Wheat, 29,500,000 bushels; oats, 1,900,000 bushels; barley, 3,550,000 bushels; hay, 700,000 tons; and the estimated value of the crops in 1924-25 was 14,158,106L., or 27L. per head of population. The value of breadstuffs exported to overseas countries averages annually 8,000,000L.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry; 50,000 acres of land are devoted to this purpose. Wine made, 13,100,000 gals. There is a considerable export trade to overseas countries, chiefly Great Britain. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants; of the former 111,261 cwts., and of the latter, 103,910 cwts. were made in 1925-26. 9,340,760 lbs. raisins and 8,799,883 lbs. currants were sent to overseas countries in 1925-26.

Almond trees (250,000) are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment. Apple trees, 1,050,000; apricot trees, 365,000; orange trees, 500,000; lemon trees, 55,000; pear, 250,000; plum, 300,000; peaches and nectarines, 340,000; cherries, 80,000; and also figs, quinces, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, walnuts, peanuts, etc. The principal kinds of fruits produced each season is as follows:—Apples, 680,000 cases; apricots, 220,000 cases; peaches, 200,000 cases; oranges, 360,000 cases; pears, 160,000 cases; and plums, 130,000 cases. The dried fruit production is as follows:—Apricots, 9,000 cwts.; apples, 1,000 cwts.; peaches, 6,000 cwts.; pears, 2,000 cwts.; and plums, 4,000 cwts.

Returned soldiers and others are being settled on irrigation blocks for fruit and vine culture and for dairying along the River Murray, and the area under irrigated culture has increased from 7,000 acres in 1914, to 36,000 acres in 1925, and large areas are now being prepared for settlement by the building of locks, pumping stations, channels, etc.

The State possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive, 30,000 gallons of oil being expressed annually. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and superiority general over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a high position in the local market. 8,000 gallons of eucalyptus oil are distilled, and an export trade is being worked up.

Potatoes, onions, turnips, carrots, mangolds, pumpkins and melons, tomatoes, and practically all kinds of vegetables grow well in the State, their production in 1924-25 being valued at 370,000L.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. In 1926 there were 150,000 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 244,111; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 373,597; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to 6,810,495; whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 160,000 bales. Last year there were made 17,244,389 lbs. of butter, and 3,679,552 lbs. of cheese; and 5,095,970 lbs. of bacon and hams were cured. In normal seasons, large quantities of butter, frozen meat, etc., are exported to Europe, in addition to tallow and skins and hides. 2,473,287 lbs. of butter were sent last year. The value of pastoral and dairying products exported overseas averages 6,000,000L.
The keeping of bees is generally carried on in conjunction with other pursuits, and during 1924-25, 2,764,389 lbs. of honey were produced.

South Australian wattle bark holds a high place in the market for tanning purposes, about 6,000 tons being stripped every year.

The number of manufactories is 1,711, employing 38,353 hands and 129,192 horse-power actually used. Wages paid 7,537,433l. Total value production 32,143,953l. Value of land, buildings, plant and machinery, 14,411,973l.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, and there are now many steam flour mills, saw mills, foundries, agricultural implement works, electric light and gas works, breweries, and factories for clothing, boots and shoes, saddlery, jams, aerated waters, soap and candles, fertilizers, joinery, cycles and motors, brushware, glassware, etc., etc. Shipbuilding has also been commenced. Several marble and slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened.

Out of 19,273,608l. worth of produce exported overseas during 1925-26, the value of breadstuffs amounted to 7,439,492l.; while wool represented 4,432,432l.; fruits and wine, 859,772l.; butter, 165,172l.; meats, 78,987l.; tallow, 68,451l.; concentrates 1,894,603l.; lead, pig, 2,300,707l.; hides, 639,406l.; bullion and specie, 1,061,866l.

The chief imports are textiles, sugar, alcohol, tea, hardware, and machinery, manures, paper, oils, timber and vehicles. The total external trade reaches 35,000,000l., almost half of which is with the United Kingdom, the bulk of the remainder being with other British Countries, the United States, France, Italy and Japan.

The minerals produced during the year 1925 were valued at 1,028,471l., the chief being copper 35,878l., salt 176,066l., ironstone flux 674,649l., and gypseum 63,242l.

Since the inception of the state, 43,151,682l. of minerals have been produced, of which copper accounts for 33,024,836l.

Value of Production, 1924-25.

The crops produced in South Australia were valued at 16,318,080l., and in addition the net factories output was 11,332,374l., pastoral 8,137,801l., minerals 953,238l., dairying and poultry 3,301,035l., fisheries and game forestry, &c., 1,039,899l., the grand total being 40,082,427l., equal to 74l. per head of population.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

Ten banking institutions in addition to the Commonwealth Government Bank carry on business within the State, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland townships—numbering altogether 380 branches and agencies. Their names are: The Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Limited; National Bank of Australasia, Limited; English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Limited; Bank of Adelaide; Bank of New South Wales; Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited; Bank of Victoria, Limited; and Australian Bank of Commerce, Limited; Primary Producers Bank of Australia, Limited. The total average assets of the eleven banks amount to (June, 1926) 25,053,820l., and the total deposits to 25,787,075l.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 40 branches and 340 agencies. The number of depositors on 30th June, 1926, was 429,264 and the total deposits amounted to 19,137,983l. Rate interest paid to depositors, 4½ per cent. The Commonwealth Savings Bank had 59,884 depositors and 2,639,355l. deposits at the same date. 85 in every 100 persons of the population are depositors in savings banks, the deposits averaging nearly 40l. per head of population. The total deposits in Savings Banks and Banks of Issue amounted to 45,046,002l., being 80l. per inhabitant.

Penny Banks.

Agencies at schools, 848; depositors, 46,810; deposits, 70,504l.

Education.

The University of Adelaide was founded by Royal Letters Patent in 1881, and an Act of the local Parliament in 1874. It was endowed by private munificence, aided by an annual grant of 5 per cent. on all sums contributed from private sources, and an endowment of land, the total amount of income for 1926 being 136,080l. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and music; the staff consists of 197 professors, lecturers, &c., 18 being lecturers and assistants and teachers in the Conservatorium of Music. All classes are open to women. It had in 1925 732 undergraduates and 754 non-graduating students (exclusive of 632 students at the Conservatorium of Music), besides those attending extension lectures. Total expenditure, 78,320l.

The School of Mines and Industries was established in 1889. It is supported by an annual parliamentary vote of about 20,000l. and by school fees. Diplomas are awarded in mining, metallurgy, and mechanical engineering. The staff consists of 86 teachers. The students number 3,663, including children from public schools receiving instruction in domestic economy. There are in addition nine Technical Schools in the country with 1,584 scholars; one School of Arts and Crafts, with 979 students, and Apprentice Classes, with 747 students.

Primary, secondary and technical education is provided for by the Education Acts, by which the management of public education is committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free from January 1, 1892, up to the compulsory standard, and it has been compulsory since 1876. In 1925 there were 1,041 schools, with 3,127 teachers and teachers in training, and 84,284 scholars. Included in these are 24 High (secondary) schools, with 154 teachers, and 3,908 scholars, and technical education is imparted at 30 Domestic Art Centres and 14 Woodwork Centres and also at a number of primary schools in addition to the technical schools mentioned above.
The expenses of the Education Department for payment of teachers, etc., and buildings, were during 1925, £89,383. The total expenditure from loan money on school buildings up to December 31, 1925, was £1,241,607.

Towards the maintenance of the South Australian Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, also country institutes (240 in number) the sum of about £28,900 is annually granted by the Government in addition to special grants for buildings.

There are also 184 Private Schools with 873 teachers and 14,990 scholars.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the State consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and three Puisne Judges; the Court of Vice Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, and Gladstone, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court; Local Courts of Insolvency at Port Augusta, Gladstone, Mount Gambier, and Port Wallaroo, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction in all the principal towns throughout the State with full Jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates, and Limited Jurisdiction, by Justices of the Peace; and Police Magistrates' Courts.

The number of persons convicted in the Supreme Court in 1925 was 123, approximately one in every 5,000 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes.

Means of Communication.

There are 42,500 miles of roads defined in the settled districts, the greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed from the General Revenue—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 12,000. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

The railways are all constructed and worked by the Government. The mileage opened for traffic in the State is 2,499, exclusive of the Port Augusta Oodnadatta railway, 478 miles, and the East West railway, 598 miles, which are controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Up to June 30th, 1926, the cost of construction and equipment reached £25,902,778. The receipts in 1925-26 were £4,262,174. There is daily railway communication between Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, and tri-weekly between Perth.

The geographical position of South Australia necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. To accomplish this South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of telegraph, some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over £500,000 across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party. An additional wire has been erected at a cost of over £50,000. At present the railway reaches Oodnadatta, 688 miles north of Adelaide, and Katherine River, 199 miles south of Palmerston, the intervening gap being 1,200 miles, and it is proposed to build another section from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs.

On the 30th June, 1925, there were 736 telegraph stations in the State, and the number of telegraph messages sent in 1924-25 was 2,144,808. There were 373 telephone exchanges, with 29,541 connections.

Internal water communication is afforded by the Murray River, on which steamers run for 2,000 miles. There is regular and frequent communication by mail steamers with all parts of Australasia as well as with Europe and San Francisco.

**TASMANIA.**

**General Description.**

Tasmania, the smallest State of the Australian Commonwealth, is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide, Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 33' and 43° 39' S. lat., and 144° 39' and 148° 23' E. long.

**History.**

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Diemen's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1833. It was not known to be an island until 1798. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay, from which it was separated in 1825. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856. Federation with the other Australian Colonies came into effect on the 1st of January, 1901.

**Climate.**

Captain Cook described the climate as "the finest in the world," and succeeding generations have endorsed the verdict. It is of the type of the south of England, rather warmer in summer, considerably milder in winter, and with much more sun at all times. The rainfall varies from 20 ins. on the East Coast to over 100 ins. on the Western Mountains. The mean temperature at Hobart in the three hottest months is 62°, about the same as London, and in the three coldest months 47° which is 8° warmer than London.

**Means of Communication.**

There is a mail and passenger service, two or three times a week, between Launceston and Melbourne, and twice a week between Burnie and Melbourne, and a weekly service between Hobart and Sydney.

Mail and passenger communication with Europe and America is chiefly via Melbourne and Sydney. In the apple season (February to May) direct steamers leave Hobart every few days for England; at other times of the year less frequently.

Post and telegraphs are controlled by the Commonwealth. There are 2,531 pole-miles of telegraph, and telegrams were sent in 1924–25 at the rate of 4·0 per head of the population. Telegrams within the Commonwealth cost 1s. 3d. for 16 words.

There are 10,753 telephone instruments connected, which is 49 per 1,000 of population.

There are 548 Post Offices in the State, and the number of letters and postcards received and despatched in 1924–25 was 140 per head, and of packets and newspapers 60 per head.

Postage rates for all British Dominions are 1½d. per oz. for letters, and for newspapers 1d. per 4 ozs.; for all other places, 3d. for first oz., 1½d. for each additional oz. for letters, and 1d. per 2 ozs. for newspapers.

The receipts for Post and Telegraph and Telephone services in Tasmania in 1924–25 exceeded the working expenses by 21,000l.

**Area.**

The State contains 26,215 square miles (16,778,000 acres) of which 6,246,357 acres had been granted or sold up to 1925. Of the balance
2,245,470 acres are held under pastoral and timber leases and occupation licences, which return £32,000 in rentals to the State; and 52,000 acres for mining purposes which returns an annual rental of £12,000. About 50 per cent. of the total area is still in the hands of the Crown, but a large proportion of this is unsuitable for settlement.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group (including Flinders Island), Robins Island, King Island, Bruny Island on the south, and Maria Island on the east coast.

Roads.

All roads are constructed by the State Government, mostly out of Loans; but the Federal Government, beginning with 1924, gives a subsidy in aid of special new constructions. The maintenance of main roads is also borne by the State, partly out of a Motor Tax; of all others by Municipalities. There are 6,200 miles of macadamised, and 5,800 miles of other roads.

Railways.

There are now 858 miles of railways in the state; constructed mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. Of these 696 belong to Government, d cost £6,875,326., and 163 to private companies costing £1,170,229. The gross earnings of the government lines in 1924-25 were £1,256L, and working expenses £531,590., making profit on working of 0'26 per cent. of the capital, against an average rate of interest payable of 3 per cent. The net deficiency, £290,466., is about 1 per cent. of the total (State and Commonwealth) taxation. The private lines return almost exactly the same percentage of capital cost as the State lines.

Land.

There is little first-class Crown land now available for selection. Most of the accessible land of all kinds has been alienated, though only a small proportion has been cleared for cultivation. Bush land suitable for fruit-growing is readily obtainable at from £5. to 10/- per acre. Cleared land can often be had for little more than the present expense of clearing.

Some 100,000 acres of land have been purchased by the Government for closer settlement, besides 200,000 acres for soldier settlement. These are now held under lease from the Crown with right of purchase.

Trade.

The chief exports in 1925-26 were:

| Item                  | Value   |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Fruit, fresh and preserved, &c. | £1,387,031 |
| Zinc                  | £1,589,197 |
| Other Metals and Ores | £1,109,108 |
| Wool                  | £815,876  |
| Potatoes              | £698,678  |
| Timber                | £545,304  |
| Hides and Skins       | £398,645  |
| Hops                  | £162,969  |
| Butter                | £102,722  |

Confectionery, Woollen Goods, Cement and Carbide of Calcium are other exports of growing importance.

Hobart does over one-half of the total trade, and Launceston over one-quarter. Burnie and Devonport are considerable exporters of farm produce to the mainland States.

Farming.

The land in crop in 1925-26 was 266,000 acres (5 per cent. below the decennial average), including 34,000 acres of orchard. The area under hops was reduced from 1,500 to 1,200 acres on account of over-production and unprofitable prices. Wheat production (average yield 18 bushels) is below home requirements; but oats (25 bushels), oaten hay (1'4 tons), and potatoes (2'6 tons), produce a considerable surplus for export to the mainland. The apple crop goes normally two-thirds to Europe and one-third to Australian States, which also take the bulk of the soft fruits. Apple production was over three million bushels marketed, of which two million bushels shipped to Europe met with such disastrous prices as barely covered the costs of marketing.

Wool production in 1924-25 was valued at £1,446,000. The number of sheep was 1,614,000, and of cattle 225,700, which are respectively 4 per cent. below and 12 per cent. above the average for the last 10 years.

Farming wages are about 8s. per day, or 2/- per week for permanent hands.

Mining.

Tasmania has a particularly rich and varied store of minerals, particularly in the west, north-west and north-east parts of the island. The most important mines are copper, silver-lead, silver-lead-zinc and tin, followed by coal, osmiridium and gold. Wolfram, asbestos, iron pyrites, bismuth and ochre are also produced, but in small quantities. Large and valuable deposits of iron ore and shale are being developed, but have not yet reached the producing stage. From 1880 to 1925 the State produced minerals valued at £2,549,163.

The chief copper producer is the Mt. Lyell mine, one of the great mines of the world, which in the last 30 years has produced over 201,000 tons of copper. For 1925, the production was—copper, 6,539 tons; gold 2,229 ozs.

Tin is found in many parts of the island. The chief producer has been Mt. Bischoff, another of the great mines, which has produced tin to the value of over 5,000,000., and paid dividends of £2,500,000. Substantial quantities are also got from the alluvial deposits of the north east which are now more important than Bischoff.

Zinc is produced chiefly at the Electrolytic Works at Risdon, a suburb of Hobart, from concentrates brought from Broken Hill. The new plant with an output of 100 tons of zinc per day, using 30,000 electrical h.p., is now in full operation. Subsidiary works are now in operation at Zeehan to treat the valuable complex ores near Dundas, which have hitherto resisted commercial treatment. The total output of zinc for the year 1925 was 46,088 tons, valued at £1,670,971, of which only 3,112 tons, valued at £110,691, was produced from Tasmanian ores.

Coal is widely distributed, but not generally of high quality as steam-coal. The production in 1925 was 81,700 tons. Valuable deposits of high grade steam-coal are now being developed at Recherche Bay in the extreme south.

Gold, once of high importance, has now taken a minor place in mineral production. In 1925 3,524 ozs. were produced, worth £15,041.

Osmiridium of high quality is a special Tasmanian product. It has been won by simple washing methods from the serpentine detritus in several localities now worked out. A new field
discovered in 1925 promises greater permanence. The output in 1925 was 3,366 oza., valued at £103,570.

Hydro-Electric Power.

The water power of the island is under process of steady development, under a State department. The first scheme of using the waters of the Great Lake (on the Central Plateau, at a height of 3,300 feet), is now assured success. The present capacity is 63,000 horse power, all of which is now being used for industrial or domestic purposes. A further development of 13,000 H.P. also on the Central Plateau is nearing completion. For the year to 30th June, 1926, the revenue was £245,196.

The Great Lake station supplies the Zinc works at Risdon (electrolytic extraction of zinc, zinc-rolling and zinc oxide), the Carbide works at North West Bay, the Cadbury Combine of chocolate manufacture at Claremont, and the requirements of Hobart and Launceston for tramways and general and domestic use.

Further large demands for power are now a certainty in connection with wood-pulping. The old problem of turning the enormous waste of eucalyptus into paper has now been solved. Operations will commence in the first instance at Geeveston on the Huon River. It is expected that in a few years the Australian consumption of paper of all kinds will be fully met.

The Mount Lyell Hydro-electric plant at Lake Margaret, generating 8,000 h.p., supplies the Lyell mine, and the concentration of the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Zeehan, referred to above.

Other Industries.

The principal other industries, apart from those for the satisfaction of the State's own requirements, are saw-milling, fruit-preserving (jam making, canning, drying, etc.), confectionery, wool manufacture and cement.

Tasmanian apples have long enjoyed a good name throughout Australia.

Population.

The population, as determined on June 30th, 1926, is males, 104,115; females, 105,263. Total 209,378.

There was normally an excess of males in the population, amounting in 1914 to 2 per cent. of the population. After considerable fluctuation, due to the war, the proportion of the sexes has steadied to very near equality.

The birth rate has dropped from a pre-war average of 30 per 1,000 to about 25 per 1,000. The death rate of 10 per 1,000 is little less than the pre-war average, so that the rate of natural increase has declined considerably. It is still, however, over 15 per 1,000, and the highest in Australasia. The infant death rate in 1925 was 55 per 1,000 births.

Hobart on the river Derwent is the capital, and had, with the suburbs, a population (census 3-4-21) of 53,400. Launceston, on the Tamar, had 28,000.

Migration.

The population is swelled annually during the summer by about 20,000 visitors from the mainland cities; for Tasmania is the natural playground of Australia. The permanent growth of population, however, in spite of high natural increase, is somewhat slower than in Australia as a whole. Tasmania has, in fact, since 1850 been a source of population for other parts of Australasia, and except for brief intervals there has been a steady outflow to those parts of the mainland which are in the state of most rapid development. On the other hand, Tasmania offers peculiar attractions to a certain type of settler, such as the retired officer or civil servant, possessing a pension or some private means. Though the cost of the necessities of food and clothing are no lower than in other States, the amenities of life are more accessible and come within the reach of very moderate incomes. In education at moderate expense and in bringing up of children generally, the island has great advantages. These circumstances coupled with an attractive and healthy climate, great beauty of scenery, and an easy-going and friendly temper in the people, have always, and increasingly in recent years, attracted a fair number of settlers of this type, which has balanced in part the loss of the younger native-born, who have set out to push their fortunes in other States and Dominions.

Banking.

The system of coinage is the same as in Great Britain. Commonwealth notes replace Bank of England and Treasury notes as legal tender.

There are seven cheque-paying banks operating in Tasmania, including the Commonwealth Bank.

The Commonwealth Savings Bank operates throughout the State through the Post Offices, having taken over, by agreement, the State Savings Bank. There is also a Savings Bank managed by Trustees at Hobart, with branches in a few country towns, and one at Launceston, and a State Agricultural Bank. The total deposits in Savings Banks are equal to about 21l. per head of population. The number of Savings Bank accounts is 63 per 100 of the population.

Education.

The University of Tasmania, established in 1890 at Hobart grants degrees in Arts, Science, Law, Engineering and Commerce.

Its revenue comes largely from the State, which, however, exercises no direct control, but half of the members of the governing body are elected by the members of Parliament.

The University has 7 professors, 16 lecturers, and 230 students taking courses for degrees. Twenty-nine scholarships from public grant and private benefaction are tenable at the University; these cover tuition fees, and for country students add a maintenance allowance in most cases. The University also largely controls secondary education by conducting intermediate and leaving school examinations, and on the results of the latter most of the University scholarships are awarded.

Under the joint control of the Workers Educational Association and the University, 11 Tutorial classes, were held at different centres in 1925.

Secondary education is about equally divided between the older Secondary schools (partly "Public," partly "Private") and the newer State High Schools, which are free. Of the former the principal are Hutchins School and Friends' High School in Hobart, and the Launceston Grammar School; of the latter, full-course schools are working very successfully in Hobart, Launceston and Devonport.

Practically every qualified child in country districts can get a bursary, covering maintenance, to one of the State High Schools.

The expenditure on State High Schools, apart from capital cost and repairs, is about 20s. per pupil.
Primary education is mostly in the hands of the State. It is free, compulsory and non-sectarian in State schools. A complete course of training at the Teachers' College has now been sufficiently long in operation to ensure an adequate supply of trained teachers for all requirements.

Tasmania was, in Australia, the pioneer State in the matter of medical inspection and treatment of school children.

Central Government.

The main lines of the present Constitution were laid down by a local Act in 1855. These have been amended from time to time and, of course, profoundly modified by Federation.

Parliament consists of two elected Houses. The Legislative Council of 18 members is elected by free-holders of 10l., and lease-holders of 30l. annual value. Returned soldiers are also entitled to vote. Three members retire annually, and the Council cannot be dissolved as a whole.

The House of Assembly is elected on adult suffrage for a maximum of three years, and consists of 30 members returned for five six-member constituencies, which are the same as the Commonwealth electoral divisions. The system of voting is substantially the Hare system of the single transferable vote, with obligation to record at least three preferences. After an earlier partial trial it was applied to the whole State in 1909, and seven General Elections have been held under it. The system has given general satisfaction. The machinery has worked easily and the elector has been so little troubled by its supposed intricacy that the proportion of informal votes is smaller than that for a block vote in Federal Elections. For each of the seven elections, the system has given representation to parties in almost exact proportion to their strength. A number of amendments have been proposed to improve and safeguard proportional representation, but no serious proposal has been made for reverting to older methods. Casual vacancies, the bugbear of proportional representation, are filled from the results of the previous General Election, and this method has been found satisfactory in practice. Full information may be found in the departmental reports, and the detailed rules of the scrutiny in the Commonwealth Year Book, No. 6.

The power of the Upper House to amend money bills sent up from the Assembly has always been a matter of some doubt, and at the end of 1924 was successfully challenged by the House of Assembly in respect both of the Appropriation Bill and of an Income Tax Bill. The controversy on the subject was early in 1926 settled by a compromise, by which the Upper House gave up any claim to amend the Appropriation Bill or bills imposing a rate of Income Tax, but maintained full powers of amendment of other money bills.

Taxation.

The State imposes graduated taxes on incomes and on land and estates passing at death. Income Tax is much the most important and includes a considerable sum drawn from winners of lottery prizes throughout Australia.

Under the Land Tax Act the rates payable on unimproved values (without exemption) range from 1d. in £ on the first 2,500l. to 3½d. on portions over 80,000l.

The Income Tax Act is based upon the Commonwealth Act in operation in 1922. The rates on taxable amounts not exceeding 2,000l. from property or 3,000l. from business are identical under both Acts; but the taxable amounts or corresponding gross incomes are different. Incomes of less than 125l., and in the case of married persons of 200l., are exempt. Deductions from taxable amounts of 1l. for every 2l. by which the income is less than 500l., and also a deduction of 3½l. for each child, are allowed to married taxpayers, and £1 for every £6 by which the income is less than £400 to unmarried persons.

The rates per £ on gross incomes from business range from 4d. to 2s. 5d.; and on incomes from property from 4d. to 2s. 11d. The tax on Companies is 1s. 9d. in the £. In addition to these State Taxes, the Commonwealth also imposes taxes on income and land, and collects death duties.

Local Government.

There are 48 municipalities, under the Act of 1907, besides Hobart and Launceston, the constitutions of which are earlier and somewhat different. Police and Education are both centralised, but in other respects municipal powers and functions are of the usual type; the most important in the country being the maintenance of roads, other than main roads. The Councils elect a Warden as Chairman, and appoint a Council Clerk as permanent executive official. The Councils are elected by the ratepayers, with votes varying in number from one to six, according to the annual value of their property. All rating is on capital value, and not, as with State taxation, on the unimproved value.

About half the municipalities undertake some measure of water supply, and about one-third do some lighting. The rates vary from about 1s. 3d. in some purely agricultural districts, to from 3s. to 5s. in the towns and mining districts.

VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the River Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass' Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and on the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the State meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 31' S., longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,974,681 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places.

That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other States of the group, that it now contains 28 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The estimated population on the 30th June, 1926, was 1,694,479, viz., 842,892 males and 851,587 females. These numbers give a proportion of 101 females to 100 males.

Immigration.

For several years prior to the war the Government pursued a policy of assisted immigration from the United Kingdom and other countries, and met with a considerable amount of success. Agriculturists, rural workers, and domestic servants were the classes of immigrants principally encouraged. Assisted immigration was suspended during the war, but the nominated system on a reduced scale was continued. On 1st March, 1921, a joint Commonwealth and State scheme of immigration came into operation, and from that date the Commonwealth Government assumed responsibility for the booking of passages for nominated and other settlers proceeding to Australia. Approval of nominations is dealt with by the State authorities, who also indicate the classes and numbers of persons who may be absorbed in the population. Inquiries in Great Britain should be addressed to the Director, Commonwealth Migration and Settlement Office, Australia House, Strand, London.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 577 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number 1,785. The postal, telegraph and telephone revenue was £2,771,870., in 1924-25, and the expenditure £2,327,934.

There are 13,014 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and 38,388 miles of wire; also 432,956 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1924-25 was 4,461,790. There are 112,226 telephones in use in the State, with 81,794 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1924-25 was £1,368,882.

The railways in Victoria, with the exception of two small lines, are all owned by the Government.
The number of miles open for traffic on 30th June, 1926, was 4,635, and 56 miles were in course of construction. In 1925-26 the gross receipts were £12,743,666., and the working expenses £9,833,240L The interest and expenses on the debt incurred for construction amounted to £3,092,695., and the revenue deficit for the twelve months was £82,369/.

Climate.

From its geographical position Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other State of Australia. In regard to heat the weather is never severely oppressive, except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 58°4'; the mean atmospheric pressure noted first at an Observatory, 91 feet above the sea level, and later at the Weather Bureau 115 feet above sea level, was 30.012 inches; rain falls on the average upon 137 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25.65 inches.

Early History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonisation, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered in February, 1802, by Acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year an attempt was made to colonise the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the (as yet) unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements, but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when, on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is grazing and agriculture, 6,890,922 acres being under cultivation in 1925-26. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 2,513,494 acres, producing 29,255,534 bushels; oats, 437,696 acres, producing 4,998,165 bushels; barley, 103,395 acres, producing 1,774,963 bushels; potatoes, 63,369 acres, producing 160,729 tons; and hay, 1,013,613 acres, producing 929,068 tons. About 42,467 acres were devoted to the culture of the vine, producing 1,368,765 gallons of wine, 386,999 cwts. of raisins, and 104,948 cwts. of currants. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. The dairying industry has made rapid strides; in 1924-25 there were produced 100,849,382 lbs. of butter (of which 53,371,160 lbs. were exported overseas) and
6,193,135 lbs. of cheese. In March, 1926, there were in the State 463,051 horses, 1,613,787 cattle (including 727,940 milch cows), 13,740,500 sheep, and 339,601 pigs. The wool exported overseas in 1924-25 amounted to 116,942,582 lbs., valued at £14,446,378. The amount of gold raised in 1925 was 47,296 ozs., making a total since 1851 of 71,176,997 ozs., valued at £302,339,954. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the State will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of coal raised in 1925 was 1,410,714 tons, valued at £762,621. The chief exports other than wool and gold are grain and flour, butter, hides and skins, meats, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are textiles and apparel, sugar, woollens, coal, tea, timber, paper, oils, machines and machinery, and iron. Melbourne does 87 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Wahgunyah, Yarrawonga, Gooramadda, Koondrook, Toomelah, Cobram, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1924 numbered 347, with a total tonnage of 168,685.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments employing four hands or upwards, except when machinery worked by steam or other power is employed, and except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on therest; were this done, the manufactories of the State might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. The following is a statement of the number and nature of manufactories and hands employed therein during 1924-25:

| Nature of Industry                  | Number of Manufactories | Hands employed |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|

Total: 7,425 hands employed

The total number of all establishments is 7,425, of which 1,238 use steam or gas engines, 4,448 use electric power, and 432 oil, water, &c. They employ 154,158 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is £61,031,975. The value of materials used was £65,205,233, and of articles produced or work done £118,177,394. The wages paid amounted to £29,067,052.

The estimated value of Victorian production in 1924-25 was as follows:

| Category                          | Value       |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Agricultural Production           | £18,165,772 |
| Pastoral and Dairying Production  | £29,615,977 |
| Mining Production                 | £1,468,866  |

| **Total**                         | **£101,544,294** |

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other States. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. By the Water Act of 1905 all existing irrigation trusts, with the exception of the First Mildura Irrigation Trust, were abolished, and their works and duties transferred to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. In 1909 an Act was passed extending the authority of this latter body by giving it the general construction of works formerly intrusted to the Department of Water Supply and by imposing on the Commission all the duties formerly performed by the Water Supply Department. The capital expenditure on the irrigation works controlled by the Commissioners on the 30th June, 1925, amounted to £7,652,603. The Commission is empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation under their jurisdiction, the total area irrigated being 375,503 acres. The Mildura Irrigation Colony, lands, works, and approaches are controlled by the First Mildura Irrigation Trust. From time to time the Government has assisted the Mildura Trust until on the 30th June, 1925, the total amount advanced was £117,018, of which £109,969 was outstanding on 30th June, 1925. The extent of watering done by this Trust represented 39,212 water acres in 1923-24.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, on the 31st December, 1925, had a population of 912,130. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (40,990), Geelong (39,100), Bendigo (33,700), Warrnambool (8,020), Castlemaine (7,170), Mordialloc (7,220), Carrum (6,500), Wonthaggi (6,600), Mildura (5,850) Ararat (5,000), and Hamilton (5,200).

Coloured Immigrants.

With a view of restricting the immigration of Asiatics and other coloured persons, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Immigration
Restriction Act in 1901, which provides that any person, who, when asked to do so by a public officer, fails to write out from dictation and sign in the presence of the officer, a passage of fifty words in any prescribed language, is prohibited from landing in Australia. Certificates of exemption are granted in certain cases, and members of the military and naval forces, as well as the master and crew of any public vessel of any government, are excepted. There are not more than 6,000 coloured persons in the State.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches and agencies, numbering 884 in all, throughout the State during the June quarter of 1926:—The Bank of Australasia; of New South Wales; of New Zealand; of Victoria; Commercial of Australia; English, Scottish and Australian; National of Australasia; Royal of Australia; the Union of Australasia; Queensland National; Queensland; Ballarat Banking Co.; Comptoir National D'Ecuscompte de Paris; Australian Bank of Commerce; Bank of Adelaide; and The Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to 100,375,758/., and the paid up capital to 45,928,051/.

There are also 184 banks and branches, with 383 agencies of the Savings Bank. The number of depositors on the 30th June, 1926, was 1,130,121, and the amount on deposit was 56,461,928/., (including 738,073/., to the credit of deposit stock accounts). The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of 3,311,662/., was issued in 1925. Coinages of silver and bronze are also undertaken by the Mint.

Education.

Education establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its four affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary and secondary education; registered schools for primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognised in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are four Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, Queen's, and Newman—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, the Methodist, and Roman Catholic Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1925 was 2,557. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1925, the total number of students who matriculated was 13,141, and 9,736 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, number 26; there are also 2 Agricultural Colleges and 1 School of Horticulture. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes and open to women as well as men. The gross enrolment of pupils, excluding those at agricultural and horticultural colleges, was 14,249.

The system of primary public instruction, which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14, and State instruction is granted free of cost. In 1924 there were 2,503 State schools, with a total enrolment of 264,144 scholars, instructed by 7,444 teachers (including 467 temporary teachers). The average attendance was 171,382. In 1924-25 the cost of public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was 1,852,401/.. There is no local control over the schools.

The secondary schools are for the most part under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1925, there were 490 registered schools in Victoria, with 2,163 teachers, and an attendance of 64,265 scholars. Of these schools the Roman Catholic denomination had about one-half and over half the scholars.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is the official head of the Legislature, and assents in the name of the Crown to Acts passed by the Parliament. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 34 members elected for 17 Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 65 members returned by 65 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

The constitution of the two Houses and the qualification of Members and Electors have been amended on several occasions; and a Reform Act received the Royal Assent on 26th November, 1903. By this Act the number of Members of both Houses was reduced, the franchise for the Upper House broadened, and the property qualification for membership reduced, and several other reforms made. In 1907 an Act was assented to abolishing the separate representation of railways and public officers in the Parliament of the State—one of the provisions of the Reform Act of 1903. Officers in the service of the Government are, however, forbidden to take any part in the political affairs of the State otherwise than by recording a vote, and are prohibited from using any influence in respect to any matter affecting their remuneration or position in the public service.

The Adult Suffrage Act of 1908, assented to on 31st March, 1909, places women on an equality with men as electors for the State Legislature.

One of the two Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every three years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council, except in case of a deadlock between the two Houses. The property qualification of members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 50/.. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10/.. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 15/- annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, matriculated students of the University
of Melbourne, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated school-masters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered. By the Reform Act of 1903 the Council is now empowered to suggest alterations in these Bills.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of members of the Legislative Assembly, and universal suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. Plural voting was abolished by an Act passed in August, 1899, so far as the election of members of the Assembly is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is, under ordinary circumstances, three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856, and by an Act passed in October, 1900, provision is made for voting by post in certain cases.

All members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 500l. a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The members of the Legislative Council are paid 200l. a year.

An Act was passed in December, 1903, limiting the amount which may be expended by candidates for election expenses to 400l. and 150l., for the Council and the Assembly respectively. The purposes for which such expenditure may be incurred are also defined.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,880 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the State. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality, except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 3s. in the pound, on the annual value as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. The ratepayers if they so desire may have the rate imposed on the unimproved value of the land. In 1925-26 twelve municipalities were rated on this method. In 1925-26 there were 55 cities, towns, and boroughs and 139 shires. The number of ratepayers was 560,547; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 30,712,120l., representing a value in fee simple of 571,683,489l.; the total income in 1925 was 5,579,080l., and the expenditure was 5,900,455l.; whilst their loan indebtedness amounted to 8,146,750l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1925 was 732,470l., and its expenditure 1,202,450l., including capital expenditure 633,412l. The outstanding debt of the Trust at the end of 1925 amounted to 2,964,288l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1924-25 the Board's ordinary revenue was 1,178,862l., and its expenditure 1,189,285l., exclusive of 1,211,912l. from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1925, amounting to 15,584,660l. The expenditure on the sewerage works completed and in course of construction amounted to 9,589,073l. up to the 30th June, 1925.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities and the Insurance Companies. In 1925 their revenue amounted to 207,322l., their expenditure to 223,944l., including 19,047l. loan expenditure, and their debt to 161,268l.

The Melbourne tramways were constructed by a Trust at a cost of 1,700,794l., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. The debt was gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a public company, to which the lines were let for a period of 30 years. The lease expired on 1st July, 1916, when the balance of the outstanding debentures (450,000l.) was paid off. A Board consisting of five members, was nominated by the Government to take over and operate the cable tramways from 1st July, 1916, to 31st October, 1919, or such earlier date as might be proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council. This Board was on 1st November, 1919, superseded by another Board of seven members appointed under authority of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Act, 1918. On 2nd February, 1920, the electric tramways systems were vested in the board. The capital cost of the tramways under the control of the board, including the suburban lines, amounted to 6,011,898l. at 30th June, 1925. The cost of the cable system, which is included in this sum, amounted to about 2,417,868l. The Board is empowered to borrow up to 3,000,000l., this being in addition to the transferred liabilities attaching to the tramways vested in it.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th meridian. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 51' E.

Coast Line.

The Southern and Western coast lands are to a great extent of a more or less flat and sandy character, even though mostly protected by rocky cliffs and headlands, or dunes; there are here comparatively few natural harbours or other indentations, until the Kimberley Division is reached, where the character of the coast changes, and it becomes bold and broken, and fringed with numerous islands. The total length of the coast line, not including minor features, is estimated to be 4,350 miles.
Bays, Gulfs, &c.

The principal inlets, beginning from the north, are: Cambridge Gulf, Napier Broome Bay, Vansittart Bay, Admiralty Gulf, Montague Sound, York Sound, Brunswick Bay, Camden Sound, Collier Bay, King Sound, Beagle Bay, Roebuck Bay, Lagrange Bay, Port Walcott, Nickol Bay, Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, Champion Bay, Cockburn Sound, Koombana Bay, Geographe Bay, Flinders Bay, King George Sound, Bremer Bay, and Esperance Bay. With the exception of Princess Royal Harbour (the inner harbour of King George Sound), the principal anchorages used to the south of the 19th parallel of latitude are open roadsteads, which, as a rule, are only partially protected; but the holding grounds of these are fairly good, and accidents seldom happen to vessels properly founded. Fine harbours have, however, been artificially provided at Fremantle, at the mouth of the Swan River, and at Bunbury, in Koombana Bay.

Capes.

The principal capes are: Capes Demott and Dusséjour at the entrance of Cambridge Gulf; Cape Londonderry, which is the most northerly point of the State, with Cape Talbot, on the same peninsula; Cape Bougainville, lying between Admiralty Gulf and Vansittart Bay; Cape Voltaire, which is the western boundary of Admiralty Gulf; Cape Torrens, at the entrance to York Sound; Cape Lévêque, the western boundary of King Sound; Cape Bruguières, to the west of Nickol Bay; North-West Cape, which forms the western boundary of Exmouth Gulf; Cape Cuvier, at the northern extremity of Shark Bay; Cape Inscription, at the north end of Dirk Hartog Island, so named because of an inscription plate placed there by Dirk Hartog in 1616; Steep Point, situated on the southern entrance to Shark Bay, which is the most westerly point of the Continent; Cape Flaming, being the Western extremity of Rottnest Island; Capes Naturaliste and Leeuwin at the south-western extremity of the Continent, and Point D'Entrecasteaux, West Cape Howe, Bald Head, Cape Riche, Hood Point, Cape le Grande, and Cape Arid on the Southern coast.

Tides.

As would naturally be expected with so extensive a coastline, the tides are very varied, little or no rise and fall being experienced on the South and South-Western coasts, whilst from Shark Bay northwards they increase rapidly, though not uniformly in range, attaining at King Sound a height of 46 feet.

Islands.

The islands which occur on the coast are, as a rule, small and unimportant, those best known being Garden and Rottnest Islands off Fremantle; the Houtman Abrolhos, near Champion Bay, on which guano is found; Dirk Hartog and other islands in Shark Bay, used for pastoral purposes; Dampier Archipelago and the Montebello Group on the North-West coast; and off the Kimberley or extreme Northern coast, the Lacepedes, on which are guano deposits, and the Buccaneer and Bonaparte Archipelagos, for the most part unexplored.

Rivers.

The principal rivers are: in the North, the Ord, with its tributaries, the Denham, Bow, Negri, and Panton; the Pentecost, with its tributary, the Chamberlain; the Durack, Drysdale, King Edward, Prince Regent, Charnley, Indell, and the Fitzroy, with its tributaries the Margaret and Hann Rivers and Christmas Creek. In the North-West the De Grey, with its tributaries, the Oakover, Shaw, and Strelley; the Yule, the Fortescue, and the Ashburton, with its tributaries, the Henry and Hardy. Then, falling to the Western Coast, the Minilya, the Gascoyne, with its tributary, the Lyons; the Wooramel, the Murchison, with its tributary, the Sanford; the Greenough; the Swan, on which is situated the capital of the State, and which, inland, is called the Avon; the Murray, the Collie, and the Preston. And lastly, on the Southern Coast, the Blackwood, Donnelly, Warren, Deep, Franklin, Denmark, Hay, Kalgan, Pallinup, Gairdner, Fitzgerald and Phillips Rivers.

Mountains.

In the Kimberley District the principal range of hills is the King Leopold range. The highest point in it is Mount Broome, 3,040 feet. In the North-West, between the Fortescue and Ashburton Rivers, the highest range is the Hamersley, with Mount Bruce (4,024 feet) in the vicinity. The Darling range, which extends from Yatheroo in the North to Point D'Entrecasteaux in the South, a distance of about 300 miles, attains its highest elevation, 1,910 feet above the level of the sea, at Mount Cooke in the Cockburn Sound District. In the South, the loftiest range is the Stirling range, the highest point of which is Bluff Knoll (3,640 feet). Between it and the coast, and parallel with both, extends the less elevated Porongorup range.

Lakes.

There are no lakes of any considerable importance in the State. Between the Darling range and the coast there are a few salt water lagoons, and many fresh water lakes, the majority of which are nothing more than swamps during the dry season, and none of them are of any economic importance. The so-called lakes in the interior of the State, which are frequently of very considerable area, are, except after the occasional heavy rains, merely immense salt marshes or clay-pans.

Contour of the Country.

That part of the State lying to the north of the 19th parallel of latitude may be described as mountainous, consisting of alternating high and lower lying plateaux; the highest country here is principally of sandstone formation. The North-West Division and much of the Gascoyne Division also are distinctly mountainous, the ranges here being principally granite. The north and northeastern parts of the State contain a large area of good pastoral country. A large proportion of the South-Western and Southern sea-boards shows indications of a recent geological formation, and may be described as a vast forest, principally timbered with jarrah, karri, wandoo, tuart, marri (or red gum), most of which timbers are of great commercial value. From some points on the Western sea-board settlement has extended for about 500 miles inland. That portion of the interior lying between the 19th and 30th parallels of latitude, and between the 123rd and 129th meridians is to a very large extent unexplored, but from information furnished by gold prospectors and other travellers, this area may be described as a great tableland, with an altitude of from seven hundred and fifty to two thousand feet above sea level, the surface of which consists partly of sand dunes, varied by wide stretches of
clayey soils and ranges. Between the 30th parallel of latitude and the Great Australian Bight, much of the country is of limestone formation, and here there are immense areas of grass land, which only await the discovery of subterranean water to make them rank amongst the most productive areas of the State.

Early History.

The first authentic record of European explorers visiting any portion of Western Australia is contained in the words cut into the tin plate, now in the State Museum at Amsterdam, which was nailed on the 25th October, 1616, by Dirk Hartog, the commander of the Dutch vessel Eendragt, to a post erected on Point Inscription on what is now called Dirk Hartog Island. Other vessels successively visited, or were driven by stress of weather to the West coast of the Continent, notably the Leeuwin in 1622, the Batavia (Capt. Pelsart) in 1628, the Limmen (Capt. Tasman) in 1644, and the Geelvink (Capt. de Vlaming) in 1696. The first Englishman, however, to land on these coasts was William Dampier, who, in 1688, in the Cygnet, landed at King Sound. French navigators followed during the next century and after, viz., de St. Alouarn, in Le Gros Ventre, in 1772, d'Entrecasteaux, in La Recherche, in 1792, Baudin, in the Géographie, in 1801, de Freycinet, in the Uranie, in 1818, and De Bougainville, with the vessels Thétis and Esperance, in 1826. In 1791, Vancouver, in the Discovery, took formal possession of the country about King George Sound. In 1801, Matthew Flinders, in the Investigator, explored the Southern coast of the Continent, which, at his suggestion, subsequently received the name of Australia; whilst from 1818 to 1822 Philip Parker King, first in the Mermaid and afterwards in the Bathurst, explored and carefully charted its Northern Coasts.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent 20 convicts and a detachment of soldiers to King George Sound and formed a settlement then called Fredericks Town. In 1827 Captain James (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, in H.M.S. Success, surveyed the coast from King George Sound to the Swan River, and in May, 1829, Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Charles Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. Challenger, took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain Stirling founded the Swan River Settlement, now the Commonwealth State of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success, until, in 1850, the Settlement was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants' petition that it might be made a penal settlement was acceded to. Between 1860 and 1868, when transportation ceased, 9,718 convicts were sent out. The Imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

In 1870 the constitution, which was what is called "Representative," was established by Act 33 Vict., No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council, consisting then of three official members of the Executive Council, three unofficial nominees of the Governor, and 12 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The Legislature consists of two Houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 30 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 50 members.

Both Houses are elective.

By the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act, 1920, it has been enacted that a woman shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage for being elected to, or sitting and voting as a member of the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly.

Legislative Council.

Provinces.—The State is divided into 10 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Any person who is (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a natural born subject of His Majesty and a resident in the State for at least 2 years; or (3) naturalised for 5 years, and a resident in the State during that period.

Qualifications of Electors.—"The Constitution Act Amendment Act, 1899," has extended the right to vote equally to both sexes. The qualifications of an elector are as follows:—is not under 21 years of age, and not otherwise disqualified; is a subject of the King, either natural-born, or having been naturalised for at least 12 months; has resided in the State for 6 months; and in the province for which enrolment is claimed has freehold property of the clear value of £50, or is a householder or a leaseholder in respect of property of the clear annual value of £17, or a ratepayer of property of the annual rateable value of £17, or a Crown leaseholder paying a rental of £10 per annum.

Legislative Assembly.

Districts.—There are 50 electoral districts for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by one member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 3 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any person, 21 years of age, who has resided in the State for 12 months, is not subject to any legal incapacity, is a natural-born subject of the King, or naturalised for 5 years, and has resided in the State for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Subject to certain qualifications every person not under twenty-one years of age, who—

(a) is a natural born or naturalised subject of His Majesty; and

(b) has resided in Western Australia for six months continuously; and

(c) has resided in the district for which he claims to be enrolled for a continuous period of one month immediately preceding the date of his claim,

is entitled to be enrolled as an elector, and when enrolled, and so long as he continues to reside in the district for which he is enrolled, to vote at the election of a member of the Legislative Assembly for that district. No person can be a registered voter in more than one electorate.

The claiming of enrolment is compulsory.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible Ministers, who form the Cabinet:—

The Premier, Colonial Treasurer, and Minister
for Forests; the Minister for Lands, Immigration and Industries; the Minister for Mines and Agriculture; the Minister for Railways, Justice and Police; the Minister for Public Works, Water Supply, Trading Concerns, etc.; the Chief Secretary and Minister for Education, Health and the North West.

Western Australia is represented in the Federal Senate of Australia by six members, and in the House of Representatives by five members.

Local Government.

Under the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1906," municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding 2s. in the £ per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property. All license fees, tolls, dues, etc., under the Municipal Corporations Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. Under the "Road Districts Act, 1919," Boards are allowed to levy a general rate as follows:—Upon the unimproved rateable value of land not more than 3d. in the £, and upon the annual value not more than 2s. in the £. Provision is also made for a minimum rate of 2s. 6d. in the case of Road Districts, whilst in municipalities this is provided for by a minimum valuation. Municipalities and Road Boards have power to borrow money for the construction of roads and other purposes. Both may levy "loan rates" for interest and Sinking Fund in connection with loans; for the former the rate must not exceed 1s. 6d. in the £, but for the latter no maximum has been fixed. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Boulder, Bunbury, Busselton, Carnarvon, Claremont, Collie, Cottesloe, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Guildford, Kalgoorlie, Midland Junction, Narrogin, Northam, North Fremantle, Perth, Subiaco, Wagin, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000 consist of a mayor and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and 12 councillors—the mayor being elected annually by the ratepayers, by whom also the councillors are elected for a term of three years.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the State at the census of 4th April, 1921, was ascertained to be 332,732, and on the 30th June, 1926, was estimated at 375,158, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese at the 1921 census was 1,327, of whom 1,280 were males and only 47 females. In addition to these there were 67 male and 52 female half-caste Chinese.

The chief town is Perth (population, including Fremantle and the various suburbs within the Metropolitan Area, estimated to be, at 31/12/25, 179,388). The capital is picturesquely situated on the right bank of the Swan River estuary. The King's Park (approximately 1,000 acres), on a hill overlooking the city and the wide estuarine reaches of the river, is one of unique natural beauty. The chief ports are:—Fremantle (29,168), Albany (3,980), Bunbury (4,860), Geraldton (4,199), and Broome, with a considerable floating population of pearlers, mostly Asiatics. The chief centre of the agricultural districts is Northam (4,600), and of the goldfields areas Kalgoorlie (including Boulder), with a population of 11,163.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the State, 30,277,669 acres only were, on the 30th June, 1926, alienated or in process of alienation, while 230,662,767 acres were leased, viz., 226,610,576 for pastoral, and the balance for other purposes. No less than 363,748,364 acres were still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 4,350 miles, not including minor features, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. The south-west corner of the State, however, where the older settlements are situated, is destined to become one of the world's greatest wheat producing areas, and agriculture here is progressing at an almost phenomenal rate, the wheat harvest having increased from 2,460,823 bushels in 1909, to 23,887,397 bushels in 1926, and 20,471,177 bushels in 1926. As a rule, a sufficient rainfall can be relied upon. The areas under farms and cultivation are constantly and rapidly extending. The total area of land under cultivation on 28th February, 1926, was 9,757,188 acres, viz., under crop 2,932,110 acres, under permanent artificially sown grasses 89,170 acres, new ground cleared during the season and prepared for next season's crops 460,021 acres, land in fallow 1,594,691 acres, area of other cleared land, previously cropped, now used for grazing or lying idle 2,417,072 acres, ring-barked or partially cleared land 2,264,235 acres; beyond this, the traveller's way still lies for the most part through Savannahs or forests, varied by open sand plains covered in the season with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialised in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

The Agricultural Bank, established under the "Agricultural Bank Act, 1894," had, to 30th June, 1926, advanced a total amount of 5,730,101L. The Industries Assistance Board, established in 1915, had, to 31st March, 1926, advanced to assisted settlers a total amount of 10,509,120L. Under the Government scheme for Soldier Settlement, advances made to 30th June, 1926, amounted to 6,346,617L. Up to the same date, 5,211 returned soldiers had been assisted.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian States, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which in 1925 there were 6,861,795) are pastured in all parts of the State. The export of wool in the year ended 30th June, 1926, was 49,689,083 lbs. valued at 3,527,885L. A considerable quantity of wine is made, nearly a quarter million gallons annually. To show the advance of the wheat (and flour) industry it may be pointed out that in 1907 the export of wheat was valued at 96,675L., that of flour at 34,565L. In 1910 the figures were respectively 406,326L. and 26,427L., and for the year ended 30th June, 1916, 1,023,362L. and 214,166L. The
figures for 1920 were respectively 2,641,688L and 2,526,620L; for 1923, 1,471,101L and 670,909L; for 1924, 2,542,626L and 824,743L; for 1925, 5,153,202L and 968,501L; and in 1926, 4,186,714L and 1,294,311L. Another progressive industry is fruit-growing, especially apples, which latter are already exported in considerable quantities. The export of fruit rose in value from 925L in 1907 to 32,274L in 1913, whilst the figures for the four years ended 30th June, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926, were 237,940L, 188,947L, 246,535L and 232,149L.

The principal forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 36°. Western Australian Jarrah is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, harbour works, etc., and is being used in increasing quantities for the manufacture of furniture and office fittings. There is a large and increasing export of this and other timbers, and the forests are worked by companies enjoying concessions from the Government, and also by the State itself. The export of timber for the years ended 30th June, 1923, 1924, 1925, and 1926, were respectively 997,564L, 1,367,713L, 1,477,997L, and 1,522,968L. Sandal-wood is still abundant, and was exported to Asiatic countries to the value of 102,912L in 1922-23; 348,713L in 1923-24; 186,778L in 1924-25; and 238,203L in 1925-26.

At Broome and on the north-west coast generally, during 1926, a fleet of 246 schooners, cutters, and luggers were employed on the pearling banks, giving occupation to 165 white, 31 aboriginal, and 1,550 Asiatic pearlers. The export of pearls and shell amounted to 289,433L in 1925-26.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but of late years little continuous work has been done in them. Copper, however, has since been found also in several other districts, notably those of Mt. Morgans, Phillips River, and West Pilbara.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until three decades since. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887, and this attracted a large number of experienced miners to Western Australia. The result was the discovery of gold in great quantities elsewhere.

After the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining became for the time being the principal industry of the State, and so rapidly did the annual output of gold increase for a number of years, that it placed Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing States of Australasia—a position it still occupies, producing 66 per cent of the total gold output.

The value of gold produced up to the end of June, 1926, exclusive of premiums, was 154,976,717L. During 1925, the value of the gold production was 1,874,320L, exclusive of premiums, realised on export sales.

There is good coal in the south-west corner of the State, and evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district. On the Collie Coalfield, situated in the Wellington district, several companies are successfully working coal-leases. The output in 1925-26 was 438,137 tons.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered at Greenbushes, on the Blackwood river. Considerable quantities of tin have also been raised at Marble Bar.

Silver is found, mostly together with other minerals, and extracted in conjunction with gold. Other minerals found are antimony, gadolinite, bismuth, tantalite, lead, arsenical ore, asbestos, mica, wolfram and scheelite, zinc, graphite and magnesite, molybdenite, gypsum, manganese, pyritic ore, also limestone and ironstone.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia commenced business in Western Australia on 20th January, 1913. The average deposits for the quarter ended 30th June, 1926 (included above), amounted to 4,969,100L, including Commonwealth Savings Bank Deposits.

The State Government Savings Bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1926, amounted to 6,312,143L, exclusive of amounts deposited in the Schools Savings Bank, viz., 37,509L.

Branches of the Commonwealth Savings Bank were opened in this State at the beginning of 1913, and the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1926, amounted to 2,522,246L.

A branch of the Royal Mint exists in Perth. The number of sovereigns minted during the year ended 30th June, 1926, was 1,680,046. The total value of sovereigns and half-sovereigns minted since the foundation in June, 1899, was, on 30th June, 1926, 98,747,202L.

Education.

Government Primary Schools exist in all parts of the State, and are under the control of the Minister for Education. The whole cost of the schools is borne by the Government, and the staffs are appointed by the Education Department.

Attendance at school is compulsory for all children between the ages of six and fourteen, and only in cases of poverty or sickness on the part of the parents is exemption granted to children between the ages of twelve and fourteen. General religious teaching, exclusive of dogmatic or polemic theology, is included in the course of instruction given, whilst representatives of various denominations are admitted to give instruction during school hours to the children of adherents.

The number of Government Primary Schools open in 1926 was 816. The average enrolment for the year was 51,663, and the average attendance 46,259.

Where an average attendance of eight children cannot be maintained, the Department pays an annual grant (from 10L to 11L 10s.) for each child if the parents secure a suitable teacher.

Children in isolated localities are taught by correspondence.
Children who complete satisfactorily the primary course may pass to a District High School for a five years' Secondary Course, or to the upper classes of a Central School for a two years' course.

Three courses—Commercial, Industrial, and Domestic—are provided in the upper classes of the Central Schools.

The five years' course in the Government High Schools is divided into two sections. The work of the lower section is, with very few exceptions, common to all students. In the upper section there is a considerable amount of specialisation.

Manual training in woodwork is included in the course of all the larger Primary Schools. In the Central Schools and High Schools metalwork is also taken.

Domestic work—Cookery, Laundry and Housewifery—is included in the course of all the larger Primary Schools, and also in the course of the Central Schools and High Schools.

Continuation Classes are provided for those who leave school without passing through the upper classes of the Central Schools or the High Schools. The courses of these classes are designed to lead to higher work in the Technical Schools.

Technical Schools are established in the principal centres. They include advanced work in Science, Trades Classes, Commercial Classes, Art Classes, Domestic Classes, etc. There is also a large School of Mines at Kalgoorlie.

The University in Perth provides courses for Degrees in Arts, Science (including Agriculture), and Engineering.

Scholarships are provided by the Government to enable pupils from the Primary Schools to pass to the Secondary Schools. Further scholarships are provided to be held at the Technical Schools, and eleven exhibitions are offered each year for the University.

A number of scholarships is offered each year to enable children from country schools to attend District High Schools or the Narrogin School of Agriculture.

Scholarships for children of fallen or disabled soldiers are also offered. They are tenable at Secondary Schools, District High Schools, Narrogin School of Agriculture, Technical Schools, School of Mines, and the University.

Private Schools are open to Government inspection, and must be declared efficient. The Government Secondary School Scholarships may be held at non-Government Secondary Schools.

The total Government expenditure upon education during 1924-25 (apart from the University and the cost of buildings) was £86,516. The amount expended on buildings for the Education Department was £3,987. There was also a grant of £18,500 to the University. Other Educational expenditure amounted to £15,048. The aggregate expenditure upon Education was therefore £84,060.

Means of Communication.

The State possesses at present eight lines of Government railways as shown below. The first four form the Southern System, which is connected with the Northern System by No. 5. The Midland Railway Company's (Private) line of 278 miles, constructed on the land grant system, and running from Midland Junction to Walkaway, also affords a connection between the Southern and Northern Systems.

The Hopetoun to Ravensthorpe and Port Hedland to Marble Bar Railways are not geographically connected with the above-mentioned systems.

Total... 3,865

These lines have numerous sidings, totalling in all 399 miles.

On the 1st July, 1913, the Government took over the Perth Electric Tramways which now have a total length of 34 miles of lines laid.

There are also several other private railway lines, mostly constructed by timber companies in the south of the State, in extent about 600 miles.

Since 1917 the Transcontinental Railway (4ft. 8½in. gauge) from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, unites the railway systems of Western and South Australia, a distance of 1,051 miles.

The earnings of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1926, were £3,337,292., and the working expenses £2,509,049. The total cost of construction has been £21,026,792.

Of electric telegraph on the 30th June, 1926, there were 24,407 miles of wire. During 1924-25 the revenue received by the telegraph branch was £126,682; telephone receipts amounted to...
198,875l., and postal and other revenue of the post and telegraph department to 309,428l.; cost of post and telegraph, to 30th June, 1926, was 969,660l. There is telegraphic communication with Europe, vid South Australia, also with South Africa by Cocos Island. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the State, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are 63,952 miles of telephone wire in the State; further there are 9,120 miles of railway telephone circuits and 1,115 miles of telegraph, comprising a total length of 10,135 miles of wire; in addition, about 600 miles of private railway telephone wire.

A high-power wireless station has been erected at Applecross, between Perth and Fremantle, by the Commonwealth Government. Stations of lower power have been erected at Esperance, Geraldton, Broome and Wyndham.

The steamers of the P. and O. and Orient Companies carry mails to and from the United Kingdom and Europe, which are further supplemented by those of the Australian Commonwealth Line whilst the White Star Aberdeen, P. & O. branch line of steamers conveys those from and to South Africa. Mails are despatched to and received from Australian States, New Zealand, and Polynesia, by the Trans-Australian Railway. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 26 days vid France.

The federal postal statistics for the year ended 30th June, 1926, give the following as the number (each counted once) of letters, postcards, etc., received and despatched in this State:

| Within Commonwealth | Beyond Commonwealth |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Letters, Post Cards and Letter Cards | 31,688,500 | 4,184,500 |
| Newspapers | 6,117,600 | 1,761,200 |
| Packets | 5,820,500 | 741,100 |
| Parcels | 618,900 | 57,200 |
| Registered Articles | 478,622 | 88,794 |

Fremantle is a modern port equipped with all up-to-date appliances necessary to give rapid despatch to shipping. It is the first and last port of call in Australia for all mail and other liners using the Suez route and for many on the Cape route. All ships up to 35 feet draft can berth day or night at dead low water. It is an important fueling port for coal or oil and all other provisions are available and all repairs can be effected.

The cargo handling equipment is the best in Australia. For the year ending 30th June, 1926, the number of vessels which used the port was 669 of an aggregate gross tonnage of 4,800,649 tons. The largest vessel to berth at the wharves to date was H.M. Battleship "Hood" in February 1924.

The tonnage of cargo, including live stock, handled during the year ending 30th June, 1926, was 1,353,823.

Aborigines Department.

It is estimated that the aboriginal population of the State is approximately 25,000, about 15,000 of whom are in touch with civilization and the remainder in those portions of the State as yet uninhabited by the white man. In the more populous centres of the State—principally in the South-West—the native population is on the decline, whilst in the North slight increases are recorded.

The Aborigines are still assisting, to no small extent, in the development of the Northern portion of the State, and, had it not been for their assistance in the past, this work would not have proceeded so satisfactorily as it has done.

Some 4,500 aborigines are engaged throughout as stock-boys, shepherds, station-hands, domestic servants, etc., all of whom are engaged under permit in accordance with the provisions of "The Aborigines Act, 1905."

Generally speaking the Aborigines are not hostile, though they at times become somewhat troublesome owing to their predilection for cattle killing. Some years ago, cattle killing by natives was very prevalent, and the State spent a considerable amount of money in apprehending offenders and maintaining them in prison while undergoing sentence. To minimise these depredations amongst settlers' stock, the Government has established three Cattle Stations in the Kimberleys in order to breed cattle with which to supply the natives with meat and so prevent them from killing cattle belonging to pastoralists. The scheme has proved most successful.

Other Settlements have been established both in the North and in the South, while some sixty Rationing Stations are controlled by the Aborigines Department. One large Settlement has been established for some years on the Moore River, about 80 miles north of Perth, especially for aged and indigent natives and children requiring the care of the Department. The male adults who are capable of working are employed on farm and garden work, and the women assist with domestic duties. The children are schooled and trained in various ways. The establishment includes a sewing room, in which the girls and young women are taught to sew and manufacture garments for natives throughout the state. In addition there are seven Mission Stations, six in the north and one in the south. Six of these Missions are subsidised by the State.

There are ninety-six Protectors of Aborigines, including three women, scattered throughout the State. These Officers assist in the administration of "The Aborigines Act," and generally look after the welfare of the natives.

The total expenditure of the Aborigines Department for the year ended 30th June, 1926, was 27,719l.

The policy of the Department is in the direction of inducing the natives to support themselves by their own labors, and it is hoped that all Native Stations will eventually become entirely self-supporting.

Approximately, 12,454l. was spent during the year mentioned in direct relief in the shape of clothing and medical attendance, while a considerable sum was spent upon buildings and improvements at Stations.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate during 1925, was 9·90 per 1,000. The average rainfall at Perth is 34·03 inches (for 50 years), and the mean temperature is 66°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY.

Area and Population.

The first attempt at settlement in North Australia was made in 1824.

Upon the extension of New South Wales westward to the 129th meridian in 1827, the portion of North Australia subsequently known as the Northern Territory was included within that colony, and in 1863 was annexed by Royal Letters Patent to the province of South Australia. With the adjacent islands, it was transferred to the Commonwealth on 1st January, 1911.

The total area of this Territory is 523,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres. Its length from north to south is about 900 miles, while its breadth from east to west is 560 miles. Its eastern boundary, dividing it from Queensland, is the 138th meridian of east longitude; and its western boundary, separating it from Western Australia, the 129th meridian. Its southern boundary is the 26th parallel of south latitude, dividing it from South Australia. The northern boundary is the coast line of those parts of the Indian Ocean known as the Timor and Arafura Seas at about the 11th parallel of south latitude. The length of coast line is about 1,040 miles. The Territory includes a number of islands most of them being small and of little importance. The best known are Melville Island, Bathurst Island and Groote Island.

In 1881 there were 670 Europeans in the Territory, and at the Census of 4th April, 1921, there were 2,469. The Chinese population, at its maximum during the years of railway construction, 1887 and 1888, has gradually dwindled, the number recorded at the Census of 1921 being only 722. Japanese, first recorded in 1884, increased up to the year 1898, falling again after five years, the number at the Census of 1921 being 34. The highest recorded population, excluding aborigines, was 7,533 in 1888. The estimated population for the last ten years is given in the following table:

| Year | Male | Female | Total |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1922 | 2,540 | 1,011 | 3,551 |
| 1923 | 2,527 | 1,028 | 3,555 |
| 1924 | 2,538 | 1,069 | 3,597 |

The interior of the Territory is the most thickly populated by the natives, but it is believed that they are dying out. In the regions remote from contact with other races the native has maintained his primitive simplicity, and furnishes an interesting subject of study to the anthropologist and the ethnologist. At the census of 1921, full-blood aboriginals in the employ of whites, and those who were living in a civilised or a semi-civilised condition in the vicinity of European settlements, were enumerated—the males being 1,184, females 866; total 2,050. The estimated number of natives in the Northern Territory is about 20,000. There are, however, areas in the north-east and north-west, where it is difficult to obtain satisfactory information, and it is quite possible that with fuller knowledge the estimate will need adjustment.

Historical.

Exploration and Colonisation.

(i.) Coastal Surveys. The coast was surveyed by King in 1818, and by Wickham and Stokes in 1838 and 1839. Port Darwin, the site of Darwin, the present capital, was discovered in the latter year.

(ii.) Exploration of Interior. Leichhardt traversed a great deal of the country in 1844-5, journeying from Queensland to Port Essington. Gregory started from Point Pearce in 1855, and reached Brisbane. Minor explorations were also successfully undertaken.

(iii.) Crossing the Continent. In 1861, Stuart began his transcontinental journey from Adelaide, and reached the north coast in July, 1862. His track has become the main route, and along it the telegraph line is constructed.

(iv.) Demarcation of Boundaries. Upon the extension westwards of New South Wales, in 1827, the Territory was included in that colony, and remained so until 1863, when it was added to South Australia, which in 1836 had been created a separate province.

(v.) The Military Settlement. A military post was formed on Melville Island in 1824. This was transferred in 1827 to Raffles Bay, and a few years later to Port Essington. Little public attention was given to the station, and no attempt at colonisation was made. It was abandoned in 1849.

Control by South Australia.

(i.) Transfer. As a result of representations to the Imperial Government by South Australia, the Territory was incorporated with that State in 1863, and administered through a Government Resident located at Port Darwin up to 31st December, 1910. Early attempts at settlement failed. Ultimately, Port Darwin was chosen for the site of the capital, and Palmerston (now officially named Darwin) founded.

(ii.) Land Legislation. The South Australian Government's land legislation was framed to attract settlers, viz., low rents with easy entry and unencumbered holding over long periods; or grant of fee simple at low price. Special arrangements were made to foster tropical agriculture, including the establishment of botanic gardens at Port Darwin, for observation and experiment. Large "runs" were established on the northern well grassed and watered pastures.

(iii.) Mining. The survey and construction of the overland telegraph revealed the auriferous nature of the country, and gold and other minerals were discovered in various localities. The Government regulated the area of claims and the conditions upon which they were held.

(iv.) Cessation of Supervision by South Australia. Progress was not as marked as was desired, the Territory being thought capable of more rapid development. Accordingly the Federal and State Governments agreed upon a surrender by the latter as from 1st January, 1911, since which date the Territory has been a dependency of the Commonwealth.

Transfer to Commonwealth.

(i.) The Agreement. An agreement of transfer, afterwards ratified by the representative Parliaments, was made between the two Governments. In accordance with a proclamation issued in the
terms of the Commonwealth Acceptance Act (No. 20 of 1910), the transfer was effected on 1st January, 1911.

(ii.) The Northern Territory Acceptance Act. By the Commonwealth Act, the agreement was ratified and approved, and the Territory was accepted together with the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway; laws and courts of justice remained in operation, powers and functions of magistrates and officials remained vested; estates and interests continued upon the same terms; trade with Australian States was declared free. The Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the State loans in respect of the Territory, paying the interest yearly to the State, providing a sinking fund to pay off the loans at maturity, and paying off the deficit in respect of the Territory. It also purchased the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, and agreed to complete the construction of the trans-continental railway from Port Darwin to Port Augusta.

(iii.) The South Australian Surrender Act.—The State Act approved and ratified the agreement surrendering the Territory.

(iv.) The Northern Territory (Administration) Act, 1910.—The Act provided for Government authorising the appointment of an administrator and officials. South Australian laws applicable to the Territory at the date of the transfer were declared to continue in force as laws of the Territory and certain Commonwealth Acts to apply. Power was given to the Governor-General to make Ordinances having the force of law.

(v.) Administration.—A Resident Administrator, vested with authority in internal affairs, was appointed in the Department of the Minister for External Affairs in February, 1912.

The Northern Australia Act, 1923, provides for the appointment by the Governor-General in Council, of a North Australia Commission consisting of three (3) members. The powers of the Commission will extend to various matters in relation to the development of so much of the Northern Territory as is situated north of the twentieth parallel of South latitude (North Australia), and to the administration of Crown Lands throughout the Northern Territory.

An agreement may be made by the Governor-General with the Governor in Council of any State adjoining the Northern Territory for the application to any part of the State contiguous to the Territory of all or any of the measures of development which have been or may be applied by the Commission to North Australia. This agreement may also provide for the appointment as a Commissioner of a person nominated by the Governor in Council of the State concerned.

On and after a date to be fixed by Proclamation the Northern Territory will be divided for administrative purposes into two parts, separated by the twentieth parallel of South latitude. That part north of the twentieth parallel will be known as North Australia, and that south of the twentieth parallel as Central Australia. The seat of Government of North Australia will be established as soon as practicable at Newcastle Waters, but until the seat of the Government is so established it will be at Darwin. The seat of Government of Central Australia will be at Alice Springs.

A Government Resident may be appointed for North Australia, and one for Central Australia. The Act provides for the creation of Advisory Councils in North and Central Australia, whose function it will be to advise the Resident in relation to matters coming under its jurisdiction. The Advisory Council is to consist of the Resident (who will be Chairman ex officio), and four members, two to be appointed by the Minister and the other two elected.

On and after the date to be fixed by Proclamation for the division of the Territory into North and Central Australia, the office of Administrator will cease to exist, and the power of the Governor-General to make Ordinances having the force of law in the Northern Territory will be exercised under the Northern Australia Act. Subject to any Ordinance made by the Governor-General under the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910, or which may be made under the Northern Australia Act, the South Australian laws in force at the date of acceptance will continue in force in the Northern Territory.

(vi.) Legislation.—The main provisions of the Ordinances passed are as follows:—The powers and duties of the Administrator vested in the appointee, include custody of the public seal, appointment and suspension of officials, and execution of leases of Crown lands. A Supreme Court with original and appellate jurisdiction is instituted, the method of appointment of the Judge is prescribed, and provision is made for trial by jury, and for the registration and summoning of jurors.

By the Observance of Law Ordinance, 1921, the trial on indictment of any offences against any law of the Northern Territory, other than an offence for which the punishment is death, shall be by a Judge without a jury. A Sheriff, a Registrar-General, and a Health Officer are provided for, also the registration of births, marriages and deaths, and of deeds and documents. Custody and control of aborigines with extensive powers of supervision are vested in the Chief Protector. Provision is made for the control of fisheries. Crown lands are classified, and their mode of acquisition, entry and holding defined. The prevention and eradication of diseases in plants have been provided for. Under the Stock Diseases Ordinance the Chief Inspector of Stock has wide powers in regard to the movement of stock control and prevention of diseases, etc. A town council has been constituted for Darwin and provision made for assessment, rates, etc. Mining is encouraged by the provision of rewards for the invention of new processes, and the discovery of valuable deposits and of new mineral fields; subsidization of the industry and the issue of prospecting licences are also provided for. Provision has been made for the issue of licences to search for mineral oil, and leases of land for the working of the industry. A Board is constituted for the purpose of making advances to settlers, who intend to improve and stock their holdings, to purchase farm implements, plant, etc., or to pay off mortgages, the rate of interest and terms of repayment being set out. Advances in aid of the erection of workmen's dwellings have also been provided for. Provision has also been made for the compensation of injured workers, for controlling the sale, etc., of necessary commodities, for the appointment of a Public Trustee, for amendment of the "Taxation Act of 1884" of South Australia in its application to the Territory. A new Land Ordinance was passed in May, 1924, which repealed the then existing ordinances and provided for the appointment of a Land Board.
By an Act of Parliament passed in 1922, the Northern Territory elects a member of the House of Representatives. As this member represents a very small number of electors, he is not entitled to vote, but he may take part in any debate in the House.

Physiography.

Tropical Nature of the Country.—The territory is within the torrid zone, with the exception of a strip 2½ degrees wide, which lies south of the Tropic of Capricorn.

Contour and Physical Characteristics.—The low flat coast line seldom reaches a height of 100 feet. Sandy beaches and mud flats, thickly fringed with mangroves, prevail. Sandstone, marl, and ironstone form the occasional cliffy headlands. The sea frontage of more than 1000 miles is indented by bays and inlets, and intersected by numerous rivers many of which are navigable for considerable distances from their estuaries.

Inland, the country is generally destitute of conspicuous landmarks. From the coast there is a general rise southwards to the vicinity of the 17th or 18th parallel of south latitude, where the higher lands form the watershed between the rivers that flow northwards to the sea, and those that form the scanty supply of the interior systems. Towards the centre of the continent the land over a wide area is of considerable elevation, and there are several mountain ranges, generally with an east and west trend.

Climate.

On the northern coast, as in the tropics generally, there are two main climatic divisions—the wet season, November to April, and the dry season, May to October. The changes of season are uniform and regular. Immediately after the vernal equinox, the wet season is heralded by the cessation of the east-south-easterly monsoon, which gives place to calm and light variable winds. Intensely hot weather prevails for a few days, thunder-clouds gathering and increasing daily until they burst in heavy thunderstorms accompanied by hurricanes, and increasing in strength and frequency until the end of November, when they become of almost daily occurrence, about an inch of rain falling during each storm. During December the north-west monsoon sets in gradually, with rain nearly every day, and increasing in force until about the end of January. At this period of the year the wet season penetrates into the heart of the continent. This monsoon dies away at the autumnal equinox, and is succeeded by light and variable winds till the end of April, when the dry season commences with the setting in of the south-east monsoon. Nearly the whole of the rainfall occurs in the summer months.

Fauna and Flora.

Native Animals.—The ordinary types of Australian fauna inhabit the territory. As elsewhere on the continent, the higher Theria are rare. There are many genera of marsupials, and individuals are numerous. The birds also are typically Australian, with brilliant plumage, and not generally gifted with song. Crocodiles and fresh-water tortoises frequent the northern rivers. There are some species of snakes, mostly non-venomous, the most numerous being the harmless python. Frogs abound, the water-holding frog being common in Central Australia. The rivers contain many varieties of freshwater fish. The molluscan fauna of the coast is mostly carnivorous, the vegetable feeders being very poorly represented, probably on account of the dearth of seaweed. Land and freshwater shellfish are not abundant. Among insects, many beautiful butterflies thrive in the warm damp atmosphere. Beetles also are strongly represented. The white ant is a pest, very few timbers being immune from its ravages. Anthills in the Territory sometimes attain a height of twenty-five feet and a diameter of ten feet. Another destructive insect, particularly active and mischievous inland, is the borer. Mosquitoes and sandflies are very troublesome, particularly from January to April. There are not many crustaceans.

Imported Stock.—Buffalo thrive in the coastal districts, but their numbers have been greatly reduced through indiscriminate shooting for the sake of the hides. Timor ponies have also been introduced. Sheep-breeding has so far not been a success, but cattle thrive well.

Protection of Fauna.—Ruthless destruction of native birds is prohibited. An Ordinance gives the Administrator power to declare that any bird is protected; and provides that permits to export protected birds, or the skins or eggs of such birds, will only be issued subject to such conditions as the Administrator directs.

Flora.—The vegetation is tropical, many of the forms belonging to the Malayan and Oceanic regions. The timber trees are not of great commercial value, but in the coastal regions tropical vegetation grows luxuriantly to the water's edge. The indented arms of the coast are thickly fringed with the mangrove. On the ranges, pines, fig trees, and orange trees flourish. The Roper River drains extensive forest lands. Leichhardt pines and palms form the vegetation of the tableland, which stretches across the Territory about the 14th degree of south latitude. On the higher steppes there are a few varieties of eucalyptus, and many fibre plants are also indigenous. On the wide expanses of plain country of the interior, there is little vegetation, tree growth being very scanty, consisting chiefly of stunted eucalypts, such as the gimlet gum, black box, and desert sheoak. In the north-western districts there is an almost entire absence of lichens and mosses, though ferns are plentiful in the vicinity of the Victoria River. The following orders are well represented:—Euphorbiaceae, Compositae, Convolvulaceae, Rubiaceae, Goodeniaceae, Leguminose, Urticeae.

Production.

Agriculture.—Up to the present agriculture has not made much progress in the Territory, although it has been proved that various industrial plants thrive. Rice, tobacco, coconuts, mangoes, cotton, peanuts, and various fodder plants can be grown. Expense of harvesting at present appears to be against the economic production of rice. Trial plantations of tobacco and cotton have given promising results. Good crops of peanuts have been obtained. Much of the coastal area is suitable for coconuts, but except at the Mission Stations and one or two small isolated plantations, little attention has been devoted to planting.

Pastoral.—The spacious, well-grassed "runs" of the Territory are suitable for horse and cattle breeding. It is anticipated that the cattle trade with the East will develop. Large numbers are
overlanded to neighbouring States, which also take considerable quantities of horse and cattle hides. The estimated number of stock on 31st December, 1925, was:

- Horses, 46,390; cattle, 970,342; sheep, 8,030; pigs, 382; goats, 31,859; camels, 462; donkeys, 1,113; mules, 280.

Dairying as an industry is non-existent. The abundant indigenous herbage is, however, well suited for stock, and the making of hay and ensilage would ensure the development of the industry.

Mining.—Gold, tin, wolfram, copper and mica are mined. Both alluvial and reef gold are found, and there are several batteries and cyanide plants. The total mineral production in 1924-25 was valued at £21,715, which included tin ore valued at £16,966.

Pearl Shell and other Fisheries.

In 1884 mother-of-pearl shell was discovered in the harbour of Port Darwin. Difficulty in working, principally through heavy tides and muddy water, retarded the development of the industry for many years. Subsequently, however, the opening up of new patches led to a revival, but the war gave the industry a setback from which it has not yet recovered.

The territorial waters abound in marketable fish, and despite inadequate transport facilities a commencement has been made with a trade in fish, dried or otherwise preserved.

The value of sea products exported from Darwin during 1924-25 was as follows:

| Product     | Value (£) |
|-------------|-----------|
| Pearl Shell | 2,070     |
| Dried Fish  | 1,485     |
| Trepang     | 1,986     |

Commerce and Shipping.

No record is kept of the direction of trade between the Commonwealth States and Territories. It is, therefore, impossible to give the total imports and exports of the Northern Territory. The figures for imports from and exports to outside Australia for 1914-15, and following years are given below.

| Period    | Annual Imports | Annual Exports |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|

Internal Communication.

Railways.—Under the Agreement ratified by the Northern Territory Acceptance Act, 1910, the Commonwealth is to construct or cause to be constructed as part of the Transcontinental Railway a railway from a point on the Port Augusta Railway to connect with the other part of the Transcontinental Railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper.

The Northern line from Adelaide terminates at Oodnadatta, about 150 miles south of the southern boundary of the Territory. The only line at present in the Territory is one from Darwin to Katherine, a length of 198·68 miles, of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge; and Katherine is distant about 1,040 miles from Oodnadatta. The line from Katherine River to connect with the Oodnadatta (about 0·102 miles) has been surveyed, and the section from Katherine to Daly Waters authorized by the Commonwealth Government at a cost not to exceed £1,545,000 is under construction. The railway bridge over the Katherine River has been completed and opened for traffic and construction work south of the river is now proceeding. The completion of the gap would permit of the development of the broad belts of pastoral and mineral country towards the centre of Australia. The Commonwealth also acquired on 1st January, 1911, the property in the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta (478 miles). The continuation of this line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, a further distance of 292 miles, was authorised during the last session of the Commonwealth Parliament. The surveys for the extension have been completed and construction work from Oodnadatta has commenced.

Posts.—Postal communication is maintained by vessels belonging to Burns, Philp & Co., which maintain a monthly service between the Territory and the Eastern States. In addition the vessels belonging to the State Steamship Service of Western Australia give a service once every 60 days between Fremantle and Darwin. Inland the northern part of the territory receives its mail via Darwin, while the southern districts are served via Adelaide.
Telegraphs.—The transcontinental telegraph line, covering a length of 2,230 miles, was completed on 2nd August, 1879, at a cost of nearly half-a-million sterling. The line runs in a northerly direction from Adelaide to Darwin, whence telegraphic communication is provided with Asia and Europe, via Banjoewangie (Java), Singapore and Madras.

Between Darwin and Banjoewangie the submarine cable is duplicated. High-power wireless stations have been constructed by the Federal Government at Wave Hill, in the Territory, and at Camooweal, just over the Eastern boundary, in Queensland.

Land Tenure.

A Lands Ordinance was passed in 1924 repealing all previous Acts and Ordinances and may be summarized as follows:

(i.) Pastoral Leases. A pastoral lease may be granted for such term, not exceeding 42 years, as the Land Board determines. The rental for the first period is fixed by the Board, and is subject to re-appraisement on such dates as are specified in the lease or are prescribed. A holder of a pastoral lease under previous Acts or Ordinances may exchange his lease for one under the present (1924) Ordinance, in which case the rent varies according to the district in which the lease is situated from a minimum of two shillings per square mile to a maximum of eight shillings per square mile. A lessee must within five years stock the land to the extent provided in the lease, and keep the land so stocked during the continuance of his lease.

(ii.) Agricultural Leases. Agricultural lands are classified, and the maximum area which may be included in any one lease is as follows:—Division A, Cultivation Farms, Class I, 1,280 acres, Class 2, 2,560 acres; Division B, Mixed Farming and Grazing, Class I, 12,800 acres, Class 2, 38,400 acres. Agricultural leases are granted in perpetuity, and the rent for the first period is fixed by the Land Board, and is re-appraised every 21 years. The lessee must—(a) in the case of lands for mixed farming and grazing, stock the land to the extent prescribed by the regulations and keep it so stocked; (b) establish a home within two years and reside on the leased land for six months in each year in the case of land for cultivation, and for four months in each year in the case of land for mixed farming and grazing; (c) cultivate the land to the extent notified by the Board; and (d) fence the land as prescribed.

(iii.) Lease of Town Lands. Leases of town lands are granted in perpetuity, the rental being fixed every fourteen years. Such leases must, in the first instance, be offered for sale by public auction, and if not so sold, may be allotted by the Board to any applicant, at the rental fixed by the Board. The lessee must erect, within such time as is notified, buildings to the value specified in the conditions of sale.

(iv.) Miscellaneous Leases. The Land Board may grant a lease of any portion of Crown lands, or of any dedicated or reserved lands, for any other prescribed or approved purpose. Such leases are for a term not exceeding 21 years, and may be offered for sale by public auction, or granted to any applicant at an annual rental fixed by the Board.

(v.) Grazing Licences. Licences may be granted to any person to graze stock on any vacant Crown lands or on any reserved or dedicated lands for such period, not exceeding one year, as is prescribed, and at the rent and on the conditions prescribed.

(vi.) Occupation Licences. Licences may be granted for any period not exceeding five years, and on prescribed rentals and conditions, for the purpose of drying or curing fish, or for any manufacturing or industrial purpose, or for any prescribed purpose.

(vii.) Miscellaneous Licences. The Board may grant licences for miscellaneous purposes for a period not exceeding twelve months on prescribed terms and conditions.

(viii.) Leases to Aborigines. The Governor-General may grant to any aboriginal native, or to the descendant of any aboriginal native, a lease of Crown lands not exceeding 160 acres for any term of years upon such terms and conditions as he thinks fit.

(ix.) Area held under Leases, Licenses and Permits. The following table shows the total area held under lease, license and permit, at the end of the years 1920 to 1925.

Freehold.

Under the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1926, an amendment of the principal (1924) Ordinance, which came into force on the 6th August, 1926, provision is made for the granting of freehold in respect of:—(a) Town lands; (b) agricultural lands; (c) garden lands; and (d) tropical lands.

The following is a summary of the provisions of the amending Ordinance.

Town Lands. The holder of any existing Town Lease or of a Town Lease that may hereafter be granted, may, at any time, apply for a grant in fee simple of the lands included in the lease, and the grant may be made, provided that, in addition to complying with the conditions of the lease, the lessee has—securely fenced the land; erected on the land a residence of the value of at least 50l., within the first twelve months of the lease; resided on the land continuously for twelve months immediately prior to the application; and paid the purchase money and all moneys due in respect of the land. The purchase price fixed by the Land Board shall not in any case be less than 5l. per block.

Agricultural Lands. Agricultural Lands consist of any lands within an area declared to be an agricultural area for the purposes of the proposed Ordinance. The holder of any existing Agricultural Lease or of any Agricultural Lease that may hereafter be granted, may at any time apply for a grant in fee simple of the lands, or portion of the lands, included in the lease. A grant of the fee simple may be made, provided that the applicant, in addition to complying with the conditions of the lease, has—securely fenced the land over which the fee simple is required; cultivated not less than one-tenth of that land; stocked and kept stocked the land as directed by the Land Board; erected a residence and buildings on the land of the value of at least 50l.; and paid the purchase money and all moneys due in respect of the land. (Note—Residential conditions are already provided in Agricultural Leases under the principal Ordinance.) The purchase price fixed by the Board shall in no case be less than 2s. 6d. per acre. The maximum area of agricultural lands which may be granted in fee simple to any one person is 1,280 acres of
Class 1 lands, or 2,560 acres of Class 2 lands. Where the lands included in an agricultural lease; or leases, include both Class 1 and Class 2 lands, the maximum area that may be granted in fee simple shall be the maximum area that could be so granted if the lands were all of the same class. For this purpose one acre of Class 1 lands shall be deemed to be equivalent to two acres of Class 2 lands.

Garden Lands. Garden lands consist of Crown Lands or dedicated or reserved lands within ten miles of a town, which have been declared by the Minister to be Garden Lands. Leases of Garden Lands may be granted for vineyards, orchards or gardens, but for no other purpose. The maximum area of a lease of garden lands may not exceed ten (10) acres. The holder of a lease of garden lands may at any time apply for a grant in fee simple of the land or any portion of it. A grant of the fee simple may be made, provided the lessee has—complied with the conditions of the lease; fenced the land; cultivated and kept under cultivation at least one-third of the area for a period of not less than two years prior to the issue of the grant; erected on the land a residence and buildings of the value of at least £50., and is permanently residing on the land; and has paid the purchase price, which shall be not less than 10s. per acre.

Tropical Lands. Tropical Lands consist of areas north of the 16th parallel of South latitude which have been declared by the Minister to be tropical lands, for the purposes of the production of cotton or tropical products. Any Company incorporated or registered in the Northern Territory may, upon entering into an agreement in the prescribed form, hold an area of tropical lands, not exceeding, in the aggregate, 20,000 acres, for a term of 14 years. Every such agreement shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and no transfer of any agreement shall be permitted by the Minister except to a Company, but not to a Company which would thereby hold more than 20,000 acres of tropical lands. If the Company fails to comply with any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of the agreement, the Minister may resume the whole or any portion of the lands, and, on such resumption, all improvements (except tenant's fixtures), upon the land resumed will become the property of the Crown. The agreement will provide that the Company shall use the land for the growth of cotton or other tropical products, and that it shall plant, during the first three years of the term, one twenty-fifth of the land, and keep cultivated the said one twenty-fifth of the land so planted, and, during the last four years of the term, it shall cultivate and keep cultivated at least one-fifth of the land. The Company will also be required, after the first seven years of occupation, to pay an annual rental of 1½d. per acre per year or portion of a year thereafter until the completion of the purchase or other determination of the agreement. The Company will be entitled to a grant of the land in fee simple at any time during the term of the agreement, on payment of 2s. 6d. per acre, and provided that it proves to the satisfaction of the Minister:—That it has spent 10s. per acre in the aggregate in cultivation and for necessary plant and machinery; that it has produced from the land two hundred pounds weight of cotton, or tropical products of an equal amount in value, for every acre held under the agreement; and that it has cultivated one-third of the land.

Miscellaneous. Miscellaneous provisions of the amending Ordinance provide, inter alia, that:—(a) A husband and wife shall not hold jointly in fee simple a greater area of land than the maximum area which may be granted to any one person under the Ordinance; (b) no person shall be entitled to hold in fee simple, for his own use and benefit, whether by grant from the Crown or by transfer from any person, a greater area of any lands than the maximum area which may be granted to him in the name of the Crown in pursuance of the Ordinance; (c) no alien shall be entitled to acquire any land in fee simple; (d) no application from an alien for the fee simple of any land shall, therefore, be accepted unless it is accompanied by the statutory declaration of the alien that he has resided in the Northern Territory continuously during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the application and intends to apply within five years after the date of the application for a certificate of naturalisation; (e) the grant of any land in fee simple shall be subject to the following reservation:—A reservation to the Crown of all minerals and mineral substances in or upon the land, including gold, silver, copper, tin, metals, ores and substances containing metals, gems, precious stones, coal, shale, mineral oils, and valuable earths and substances, together with the right to authorise any persons to enter upon the land to mine, work for, win, recover and remove them or any of them, and to do all things necessary or convenient for those purposes.

PAPUA.

Situation and Area.

Papua (formerly called British New Guinea) is composed of a portion of the island of New Guinea, and of a number of islands, most of which lie to the south-east of New Guinea. The boundaries of the Territory are as follows:—"The S. and S.E. shores of New Guinea, from 141° E. long, eastward as far as East Cape, thence N.W. to 8° S. lat. in the neighbourhood of Mitre Rock, together with the territory lying south of a line from Mitre Rock, proceeding along the said 8° S. parallel to 147° E. long., then in a straight line N.W. to the intersection of 6° S. lat. and 144° E. long., and continuing W.N.W. to the intersection of 5° S. lat. and 141° E. long., thence proceeding Southward along the 141st meridian of E. long. to its intersection with the right bank of the Fly River, thence by the right bank of the Fly River bearing Southerly to its intersection with the meridian 141° 1' 47" 9" of East longitude, thence by the said meridian bearing South to a point on the Southern coast of the Island of New Guinea at the middle of the mouth of the Benbach River, together with the Trobriand, Woodlark, D'Entrecasteaux, and Louisiade groups of islands, and all other islands lying between 8° and 12° S. lat. and between 141° and 156° E. long., and not forming part of Queensland; and including all islands and reefs lying in the Gulf of Papua to the north of 8° S. lat."

New Guinea, the largest island in the world if Australia is excluded, lies some 80 miles to the north of Queensland, between 0° 0' and 12° 0' S. lat., and between 130° 50' and 154° 30' E. long. Its greatest length is 1,490 miles, and its maximum breadth 430 miles; its area being about 234,768 square miles. The islands which lie near Papua, and which form part of the Territory, number, great and small, about two hundred. Of these the principal ones are: Kiriwina (in the Trobriand group of D'Entrecasteaux), Woodlark, Normanby, Goodenough, Fergusson, St. Aignan, Rossel and Sudest.

History.

The island of New Guinea was discovered in 1511 by Antonio de Abrea, and it was touched at by several of the early navigators. The Archipelagos lying to the south-east of New Guinea...
was visited by Torres in 1606, and by French navigators towards the close of the eighteenth century. The waters that are adjacent to the Archipelagoes, and to the south-eastern coasts of New Guinea, have at different periods been partly surveyed and mapped by British ships of war.

The whole island to the west of 141° E. long. is claimed by the Dutch as suzerains of the Sultan of I'dore. The Dutch have established a post on the south coast of New Guinea, known as Morauké, which is in charge of a Resident. It is a little to the West of the S.W. extreme of the Anglo-Dutch boundary. That portion of the island which lies to the eastward of 141° E. long. and to the north of British New Guinea belonged to the German Empire. The acquisition by the British Crown of the portion of the island not claimed by Holland was long advocated by Australian statesmen, and the growing influence of France and Germany in the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the establishment of a penal settlement in the French island of New Caledonia, created some alarm in Australia lest a country lying so near to Australia as New Guinea should pass into the hands of a foreign Power. To prevent this from taking place as regards the eastern part of New Guinea, the Government of Queensland annexed it to the Empire on the 4th of April, 1883, but this proceeding was not ratified by the Imperial Government. The Intercolonial Convention held at Sydney in Nov. and Dec., 1883, passed resolutions urging the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, and undertook to recommend their respective Legislatures to provide for defraying a part of the cost of a Protectorate if one were established by the Imperial Government. On the Australasian colonies agreeing to guarantee 15,000£. a year to meet the cost, a Protectorate was proclaimed by Commodore Erskine on the 6th November, 1884, over the south-east coast of New Guinea and the adjacent islands.

General Sir Peter Scratchley was appointed Special Commissioner for the Protectorate, and arrived in 1885, but he succumbed, in the Protectorate, to malarial fever in November of the same year. He was succeeded by the Hon. John Douglas, C.M.G., formerly Premier of Queensland. At the Colonial Conference held in 1887, the Colonies of Queensland, N.S. Wales and Victoria undertook to guarantee 15,000£. a year for ten years, for defraying the cost of administering the territory now forming the Possession, on the understanding that Her Majesty's Sovereignty would be proclaimed over it. By the Queensland British New Guinea Act, 1887, that colony undertook to be responsible for the payment of the 15,000£. a year. The territory was annexed to the Crown by the newly appointed Administrator, Dr. (afterwards Sir W.) Macgregor, on 4th September, 1888.

The Imperial Government has contributed some 52,000£. towards the founding of the Possession. The local revenue raised in the Possession was formerly paid over to Queensland, for distribution amongst the guaranteeing colonies, in reduction of their contribution of 15,000£. a year, but is now kept and expended by the Government of the Possession.

At the end of 1901 the Government of the Commonwealth agreed to take over the Possession as a territory of the Commonwealth, and brought proposals before the Federal Parliament (which were adopted) for providing towards the expenses of administration a sum not exceeding 20,000£. a year. The provision ran from 1st July, 1901, and was subject to revision at the end of five years.

On the 1st Sept., 1906, a Proclamation was issued by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, under the provisions of the Papua Act, 1906, declaring British New Guinea a Territory of the Commonwealth, under the name of "Papua." The above Act provides that a sum of £20,000 shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth towards the revenue of the Territory in each financial year, up to and including 30th June, 1906, and thereafter such sums, if any, as the Parliament appropriates for that purpose. In 1921-22, 50,000£. was paid by the Commonwealth towards Administration.

**Description and Formation.**

Papua extends from east to west upwards of 800 miles, and about 200 from north to south towards either end, but is only about 50 miles deep behind Freshwater Bay, near the middle of the portion of the colony that is situated on the island of New Guinea. The total coast line of the Possession has been computed at 3,664 statute miles, 1,728 on the mainland and 1,936 on the islands. The total superficial area is about 90,540 square miles, of which about 87,786 are on the mainland of New Guinea, and 2,754 made up of many islands.

With the exception of the low coral islands of Kiriwina, Nada, part of Murua, and a few others of small dimensions, the islands are mountainous and principally of schistose formation, the highest, Goodenough, 8,000 feet. The eastern end of the Territory is also mountainous, and as the mountains extend westward they rise and coalesce to form a great central chain, which attains its greatest altitudes in the Owen Stanley range, the highest point of which is Mount Victoria, 13,200 feet, and in Mount Scratchley, the Wharton Range, and Mount Albert Edward, the latter about the same height as Mount Victoria. Further west the main range becomes more broken and lower, while pursuing nearly the same general trend towards the north-west as it had in the more eastern part of the colony. The western end of the Territory is for nearly 300 miles generally low and swampy until a long distance from the coast is reached. The mountains near the east end, on the mainland, are of igneous origin; the great masses of the central part of the main range are all schistose, while in the west sandstone predominates, but there are outcrops of igneous formation, such as Mount Yule, upwards of 10,000 feet high. On the Fly River, near the point of junction of British, Dutch, and ex-German territory, there are limestones with fossil corals, and these are also met with at many other places in the low and swampy regions of the western end of the colony and elsewhere. The whole Territory is remarkably well watered. The great mountains, and by far the larger portion of the lower country, are all covered by forest.

**Rivers.**

The majority of the principal rivers open into the Gulf of Papua. They have a general direction towards a point near the middle of the Gulf. The two largest are the Fly and the Purari. The Fly spreads out its head branches over a large area in the centre of the island, comprising considerable portions of the three different territories. Its course is about 620 miles from the sea to the boundary of Papua. The influence of the tide
is felt for six or seven score of miles up the Fly. It is navigable by a steam launch for over 500 miles.

The Purari River is the second in point of size, and seems to start from the southern side of the Bismarck range of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. It is navigable by steam launch for 120 miles. The Bailala and Lakekamu rise in undetermined mountains in the central main range. The Angabunga River has its origin from the western spurs of Mount Albert Edward; the Vanapa from the Owen Stanley Range, the Wharton Chain and the southern slopes of Mount Albert Edward; the Brown from the Owen Stanley Range east of Mount Victoria. On the northeast coast the rivers are all small, except four that open into the sea between Cape Nelson and the former German boundary. These are, proceeding northwards, the Musa, Kumusi, Mambaro, and Gira. Each of them pursues a course from the central main range towards the north-east until it enters the sea. The Gira rises from the eastern spurs of Mount Albert Edward, and is smaller than the other three, all of which are nearly of the same size.

Climate and Natural Resources.

As Papua lies between five and eleven and a half degrees of south latitude, the climate of the lower part of the country is warm. It is outside the range of the hurricanes that pervade the southern part of the Western Pacific. At Port Moresby, the seat of Government, and situated near the middle of the colony, the average temperature for the year 1925-26 at 9 a.m. was 80°6. The average maximum readings for the same period, 85°7; the average minimum readings, 75°6. The hot season is from November to May; the hottest months are January and February; the cold season is from June to October, the coldest month is August. During the hot season winds on the south coast are from the north and west, and are unsteady; during the cold season they are from the south-east, and are much more regular.

At Port Moresby the rainfall for the year 1925-26 was 26'15 inches, and at Kikori 198'14 inches, these represent the minimum and maximum rainfalls near the coast. It is much greater, but undetermined, on the central mountain ranges. On the south coast the climate is rather comfortable than oppressive during the cold season. It is generally agreeable at an altitude of 2,000 feet, a height that can be reached on foot in one day from Port Moresby. At 5,000 to 6,000 feet it becomes distinctly cold at night, the thermometer sometimes reading 50° F.; at 10,000 feet ice is met with in the early morning. Above that the grass is often covered with hoar frost, and the cold is severe.

Malarial fever, as a rule quite mild, is not rare in the low parts of the country. About the time of the change of seasons inflammatory diseases of the chest have always frequently occurred amongst the natives, and more recently the country has suffered from influenza. The mortality from this latter complaint has been estimated to be about two per cent. of the population.

The obstinate scaly ringworm, so common in many parts of the Pacific, occurs frequently amongst the natives. Plague, smallpox and cholera have not been met with since the country has been occupied by Europeans. Yaws is prevalent amongst the natives, and is now being dealt with by means of the new salvarsan compounds. Dysentery, once very prevalent in epidemic form, seldom occurs now. Europeans suffer from cancer much as they do in non-tropical countries, but cases of cancer amongst the natives are exceedingly rare. As in other parts of the tropics, the natives, with the exception of the dry Port Moresby area, are frequent carriers of ankylostomiasis (hookworm). Syphilis is practically unknown amongst the natives, but gonorrhoea occurs in most districts. Granuloma inguinale occurs especially at the west, east and northern parts of the Territory.

The climate is favourable to the cultivation of all tropical products. The cocoanut palm bears well everywhere, and is common anywhere along the coast line, but in the far interior it is not met with. Cotton would be specially suited to the dry climate of the central district. Tobacco, in certain localities, of superior quality, and sugar cane seem to be indigenous or to be long domesticated; there are several native trees and plants that yield good classes of rubber. There are some good varieties of timber, including sandalwood, ebony, and cedar. Tea, cacao, and coffee thrive well, but are not indigenous; the latter has been introduced and propagated. The climate is very congenial to rice and maize and all kinds of tropical fruit. The mineral deposits comprise gold, which exist over a large area; osmiridium, which has been found from the Gira River to the Owen Stanley Range; and in the Purari sandstone district there is coal. Indications of petroleum have been located at scattered intervals over an area of country covering about 1,500 square miles between Yule Island and the Purari Delta, in the Gulf Division of Papua. Quantities of oil and inflammable gas have been met with in the test bores put down, but not in sufficient bulk as yet for commercial purposes.

The marine resources comprise pearl-shell and pearls, trepang, sponges, trochus, snail and turtle shell.

Fauna and Flora.

There are no dangerous wild beasts in the Territory; wild swine are common. There are several varieties of wallaby, phalanger, and echidna. There are no hares or rabbits; deer are found in the vicinity of Port Moresby, they were introduced many years ago and are apparently doing well; the most dangerous creature is the crocodile. Many lives are lost each year through these amphibians and by snake-bite. The snakes are nearly related to those of Australia. The birds include the cassowary, many birds of paradise, a great variety of pigeons, the hornbill, the black and the white cockatoo, geese, many species of ducks, quails, and on the mountain tops snipe and woodcock.

The flora is as varied as the climate. On the tops of the highest mountain chains there are many species of grasses; several kinds of buttercup, forget-me-nots, daisies, rhododendrons, heaths, and other flowers of temperate climates. The forest there is principally cypress. From seven to ten thousand feet it is chiefly myrtaceous, often covered by trailing bamboo or mixed with pandanus. From two to five thousand feet the evergreen oaks are common. On the low lands there are several varieties of hardwood trees, azelie bijuga, calophyllum, etc. Native cloth is made by beating out the bark of the paper mulberry, of the bread fruit tree, or of certain trees of the nettle family. Fibre is obtained from the banana, the
coconut, from the bark of many saplings, and the best of all from the aerial roots of certain species of pandanus. Most of the trees and flowers that are met with in the tropical islands of the Pacific, or in North Queensland, occur also in Papua.

The People.

The races of Papua are now known to be very diverse as regards physical type and language. As regards culture there is less difference. When Europeans first arrived, the inhabitants used stone, wood and bone implements, but no metals. They cultivated the taro, yam, sweet potato, the banana, and on the coast, the coconut. Weaving and the use of the potter's wheel were unknown.

There are believed to be three constituent elements in the native population of Papua. The first is the Negrito, a short dark race. After the Negrito probably came a race called "Papuans," who are dark but taller than the Negritoes. Subsequently the Melanesians settled along the coast, and are now so mixed with the Papuans that it is difficult to distinguish them. They were of medium height and light-skinned, and probably were the first seamen of the Pacific and travelled in out-rigger canoes.

The present day population of Papua consists of these three elements mixed together in varying proportions.

The European population of Papua is 1,452. A census of a portion of the indigenous population has been taken and the total number of natives actually counted is 181,509, chiefly residing on the coasts. The balance of the population is estimated by District Officers at 93,034, making a grand total of 274,543.

The country and people have no history, and but few current well-defined traditions. These refer to only local movements and actions of tribes within the last four or five generations.

A large part of the interior of Papua is still in the stone age, much of it is in a stage of transition in which the stone axe and the steel tomahawk are used side by side. The aboriginal methods of house-building, of canoe-making, of pottery manufacture, of cultivation, are still generally maintained. Nearly all the coast line and considerable part of the interior has been brought under missionary influence. With the exception of two blocks between the Strickland and the Kikori, and north of the Samberigi Valley, practically the whole of the territory has been explored and most of it brought under Government control.

Five missionary societies are established in the Territory. They are the London Missionary Society, which has for its field the south coast of New Guinea; the Society of the Sacred Heart, which is established at Yule Island, and along the banks of the St. Joseph River extending to the Main Range; the Methodist Missionary Society of Australasia, which extends its influence over all the archipelagos; the Church of England Mission, which has as its field the north-east coast of New Guinea, the last-named constituting the Diocese of New Guinea, organized under a Bishop of the Church of England; and the 7th day Adventist, whose sphere of influence is comprised in the Central Division and is bounded on the North by the Brown River, on the South by the Laloki River and on the East by a line bearing approximately north-east from the coastal village of Kaile to the Main Range. The two first-named societies were in New Guinea before annexation was proclaimed; the last two have come there since the proclamation of sovereignty. The native population take readily to civilization in most great matters, while they often cling tenaciously to their own habits and customs in smaller and less important things.

Mode of Government.

Papua had formerly the constitution of a Crown colony, regulated by Royal letters patent of 6th June, 1888, under which the Government was carried on by an Administrator, with the advice and assistance of an executive and a legislative council. The correspondence of the Administrator of British New Guinea with the Secretary of State passed first through the Governor of Queensland, and afterwards through the Governor-General of Australia. By Letters Patent, of 18th March, 1902, provision was made for placing the Possession under the authority of the Commonwealth, and for the revocation of the Letters Patent governing the Constitution as soon as the Commonwealth Parliament had provided by law for the future government. Provision was made by the Papua Act, 1906, proclaimed on the 1st September, 1906, as above stated. There was no form of Government among the native population, the Polynesian system of chiefs being practically unknown; patriarchal authority did not extend beyond near family relatives, and even then was only loose. A certain measure of chiefly influence is being created now by a few men under Government authority, but control over the natives is being best acquired by the gradual creation of a force of village policemen. The Administration has at its disposal an armed constabulary, consisting of about 257 natives, enrolled from many different districts. Special laws have been passed for the protection of the native population, and for dealing with lands. A code consisting of a series of simple regulations, which are from time to time being added to, has also been passed for the benefit of the native population. The courts of the Possession consist of the Central, Petty Sessions, and Native Magistrates' Courts.

Magisterial Divisions.

The Territory is divided into eight magisterial divisions, in each of which there is a resident magistrate, who is also invested with the executive authority of dealing in the first instance with any administrative matter that may arise. Besides these there are assistant resident magistrates in certain more populous districts. The Central Court, which possesses the jurisdiction of an ordinary Supreme Court, sits wherever there is occasion. The principal seat of Government is at Port Moresby. This place is centrally situated. It is easy to approach the harbour, and the latter is large, commodious, and sheltered from all winds. It is not well watered, but is very picturesque, and comparatively healthy. The immediate neighbourhood is not well suited for ordinary cultivation on account of the rather scanty rainfall. Port Moresby is a port of entry.

Samurai, the next place in importance, is an island of some sixty acres two miles from the south-east end of the mainland. There is no
native village on that island. It is a port of entry, and the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate of the district. There is good anchorage there, but no convenient water supply. It is the port from which miners, pearl fishers, etc., generally obtain their supplies. Like Port Moresby, the neighbourhood of Samarai is very picturesque. Its rainfall is nearly three times as great as at the former place.

The third port of entry is the island of Daru, the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate for the Western Division. It has a good and safe harbour, with an approach that presents no difficulty. It is the only harbour Papua possesses in the west, and the island supplies the best building sites obtainable in that part of the country. It is visited by many boats engaged in the pearl-shell fishery of Torres Straits. Kwaiapen Bay, Woodlark Island, in the extreme east of the Possession is the fourth Port of Entry.

**Industries.**

There are no European manufactories in the Possession.

The chief industry worked by Europeans is agriculture, principally coconuts, para rubber and sisal hemp. Cotton is still in the experimental stage. Gold and copper mining are carried on and petroleum of good quality has been obtained in the Gulf Division, but not as yet in commercial quantities. During 1923-24 there were 24 white miners and 361 indentured labourers employed in gold mining. Gold to the value of £6,792l. in 1923-24, £14,980l. in 1924-25 and £32,450l. in 1925-26 was declared at the custom house for export. The gold-bearing country is extensive, but it is for various reasons very difficult to prospect. There are also indications of auriferous reefs, and several crushing plants have been established. Pearls, 16,600l. in 1923-24; 19,300l. in 1924-25 and 13,249l. in 1925-26. Trochus-shell was exported, 5,980l. in 1923-24; 8,578l. in 1924-25 and 14,140l. in 1925-26. The shell is widely distributed over the eastern seas of the colony, but large areas of water are difficult to work on account of their depth. Beche-de-mer is found on most of the reefs, and will always figure as a small industry: 10,441l. in 1923-24; 10,351l. in 1924-25 and 10,205l. in 1925-26. Sandal-wood was exported: 585l. in 1923-24; 666l. in 1924-25 and 250l. in 1925-26. It is sometimes found in the form of large trees, so far only in the central district on the mainland. It commands a fair price in the market. The rubber industry: 33,334l. in 1923-24; 68,507l. in 1924-25 and 194,849l. in 1925-26. Since 1907, cocoanuts have been largely planted by white settlers, the acreage on 30th December, 1925, being 50,506. There is also a very large area of native-owned cocoanuts. The old trees are only in small clumps, except in a few instances, and in those exceptional cases the groves are the property of large communities, who make extensive use of the cocoanut as an article of food. The value of copra exported was 136,659l. in 1923-24; 172,905l. in 1924-25 and 204,087l. in 1925-26. There are large sago fields in the colony, but this article has not yet been worked for export. Hemp, copper ore, and mangrove bark are also exported.

**External Trade.**

The customs tariff is comparatively a light one; ad valorem duties do not exceed 10 per cent. The external trade is chiefly with Queensland and New South Wales. The external trade, imports and exports, as entered at the customs, amounted to 434,363l. in 1918-19; 693,222l. in 1919-20; 657,442l. in 1920-21; 525,941l. in 1921-22; 494,875l. in 1922-23; 594,373l. in 1923-24; 826,709l. in 1924-25 and 1,120,147l. in 1926-26.

A monthly service from Sydney is carried on by a steamer belonging to Messrs. Burns, Philip and Co. under contract for the conveyance of mails and passengers. The coasting and general inter-island trade is carried on by means of a small steamer and some small cutters or luggers, many of which are manned exclusively by Papuans. There are suitable substantial wharves for working cargo at Port Moresby and Samarai, at which places all manner of supplies are obtainable at reasonable prices. Much of the internal communication will be made by the rivers. Tracks have been cut in many directions, and the natives are becoming accustomed to travel alone or with Europeans over great areas. During the prevalence of the south-east trades, travelling by small boat is uncomfortable and difficult west of Yule Island, where there is no barrier reef; but east of that the coast is largely protected. East of Yule Island harbours and good anchorages are numerous. In the interior travelling is done always on foot, but in the central district horses can be used on many tracks.

NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of three small islands lying 930 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 4' S. lat. and 167° 58' E. long., the other islets being Phillip and Nepean Islands. They comprise altogether about 15 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there. This was removed in 1856, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 194 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The Pitcairn Islanders were the descendants of the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," who occupied Pitcairn in 1790, and were removed at their own request to Norfolk Island. Of these 40 returned to Pitcairn. The total population at the census of 1921 was males 339, females 378, total 717. The chief occupation is agriculture, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The
island was on the 24th June, 1856, placed under the control of the Governor of New South Wales, who was given power to appoint officers, make laws and grant lands. On 1st July, 1914, the island was made a territory of the Commonwealth. The office of the administration is the Department of Home and Territories, Melbourne (Minister for Home and Territories, Senator Sir Thomas W. Glasgow, K.C.B., C.M.G., I.S.O., V.D.; Secretary, John Gilbert McLaren, C.M.G.). It is a station of the Pacific Cable Board. Communication is maintained once every 5 weeks by steamer from Sydney. There is a resident doctor. Education is free, and there is an efficient school which is conducted by a head master (D. R. Culey) placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government by the Department of Public Instruction, New South Wales. The village is Kingston.

THE TERRITORY OF NEW GUINEA.

(Formerly German New Guinea).

In 1884, Germany declared a Protectorate over Kaiser Wilhelm Land (the north-eastern part of the Island of New Guinea) and the adjacent Islands of the Bismarck Archipelago, and in later years the Protectorate was extended to the German Solomon Islands, Nauru, and to the Marshall, Caroline, Mariana and Pelew groups, North of the Equator.

The control and development of Kaiser Wilhelm Land was from 1886 to 1899 vested in the German New Guinea Company, which, to all intents and purposes, constituted a Government in itself, and issued its own coinage, but in 1899, the Imperial German Government again assumed control, making annual grants from the Imperial Treasury towards the cost of administration. The seat of Government was at Rabaul in New Britain.

That portion of German New Guinea, which has, since the 12th September, 1914, been administered by Australia, consists of Kaiser Wilhelm Land, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Buka and Bougainville (Solomon Islands). At the meeting of the council of the League of Nations in December, 1920, a mandate to administer these territories was issued to the Commonwealth. The islands North of the Equator are administered by Japan.

During the German regime, German New Guinea was administered by a Governor, who was appointed by the Imperial Crown. He was not assisted by any advisory council; to a great extent the laws of Germany were enforced, these being supplemented by the issue of ordinances by the Governor or higher authority. For better administrative control, the Colony was divided into seven districts, each in charge of a District Officer with certain judicial powers. This system has been adhered to by the Australian authorities.

Geographical Description.

The Mainland of New Guinea (Kaiser Wilhelm Land) is the North East part of New Guinea, having an area of about 70,000 square miles, nearly one third of the whole Island of New Guinea, the balance of which is divided between Holland (Dutch New Guinea), and the British Empire (Papua). It is divided into four districts namely, Aitape, Sepik, Madang and Morobe, the most important of the three being Madang, with head-quarters at Madang (formerly Friedrich Wilhelm Hafen) on Astrolabe Bay.

Possessing a long, but little indented coast line, the Mainland has few good harbours, the best being probably Madang and Vanimo Harbour, Sek Harbour, Hatsfeldt Harbour, Monumbo Harbour, and Finch Harbour, though Morobe Haven on which Morobe is situated is a well protected little port. Aitape is practically an open roadstead, and here, as is the case generally right along the coast, shipping, when desiring to anchor during heavy weather, is forced to do so under the lee of one of the many islands which dot the coast.

In respect of rivers, however, these three districts are more fortunate. The Sepik River in the Sepik and Aitape districts is a fine stream which rises in the mountains of Dutch New Guinea and has its mouth situated about 70 miles south east of Aitape. For vessels of, up to about 600 tons it is navigable for a distance of over 400 miles from its mouth, whilst vessels of greater size have covered a distance of over 200 miles. The Ramu or Ottillion River, a long but smaller river than the Sepik, rises in the Bismarck Ranges in the Madang District and discharges at a spot not many miles South East from the mouth of the Sepik. In the Morobe District is the Wuussi (or Markham) River, which is smaller than the two above-mentioned streams. It flows into the Huon Gulf.

The whole of the Mainland is very mountainous, some peaks rising to a height of about 13,000 feet. One or two of the islands along the coast are also mountainous, Vulcan Island being an active volcano. The mainland is believed to possess considerable mineral wealth, though, owing principally to the difficulties encountered in inland transport, no extensive mining operations have yet been undertaken. At various points along the coast, large plantations are found and Mission stations exist at many places, but comparatively little is known yet of the interior, though extensive patrols are now despatched from time to time by the Government. These it is anticipated will serve the double purpose of opening up the unknown country, and of bringing the inland native into touch with the representatives of the Government in the various districts.

The Bismarck Archipelago consists of New Britain, New Ireland, the Admiralty Islands and all the smaller adjacent groups of islands such as Lavongai and the Duke of York Group.

New Britain, a long, narrow crescent shaped island is the largest and most important island of the Archipelago.
The total area of the island is estimated at 13,000 square miles and as the mean breadth is only 50 miles, its extreme narrowness can be easily realized. Despite this, however, except at the northern and western extremities, it has never been crossed by white man. This is due to the fact that a high and very rugged range of mountains runs from one end of New Britain to the other. Little is known of the interior; the natives therefrom are considered, and have often proved to be, very treacherous, but with the vigorous system of patrols instituted during the past few years, and the development of roads into the interior it is hoped that before long, the whole interior will have been explored.

The highest peak in New Britain is an active volcano, The Father, 7,500 feet high, on the north west coast, near which are the two mountains, the North and South Son. Close to Rabaul are three peaks, the Mother and the South and North Daughter, the first named being an extinct volcano.

Volcanic action is very evident throughout New Britain, especially in the north, where, close to Rabaul, are found the Matupi Sulphur Springs situated at the foot of the Mother in Matupi Harbour. Vulcan Island, 133 acres in area, which lies on the south side of Blanche Bay, made its appearance in one night, in 1878, during an eruption from Mount Mother, when violent earthquakes were also experienced. At the present time earth tremors are of frequent occurrence.

Unlike the Mainland, New Britain is fortunate in possessing several good harbours, the best being Simpson Harbour, the inlying portion of Blanche Bay; others are Jacquinot Bay, Arawe, Linden Harbour and Powell Harbour on the south-east and south coasts and Rein Bay and Talasea Harbor on the north coast.

There are no rivers of any importance in the Island, those that do exist being short rapid-flowing streams.

Rabaul is situated upon Simpson Harbour, which is horse-shoe in shape, with good depths, well protected from winds and weather, and affords a most excellent anchorage for overseas shipping.

The bulk of the white population of New Britain has grouped itself in or near Rabaul, though settlers with coconut plantations, have operated at various suitable points practically round the whole coast line.

New Ireland lies close and practically at right angles to the northern end of New Britain. It is a long narrow Island, very mountainous, without any rivers of size, and geologically older than New Britain. The volcanic appearances so definite in the latter island are not evident in New Ireland. Its coast line is fairly unbroken and its best harbours are at Kavieng, Namatanai and Muliana on the north and east coasts and Kalili on the west coast. Crossings of the island have been made from time to time in several places, and here and there very fair roads exist.

New Ireland is divided into a northern and a southern district, the former, which includes the island of Lavongai being known as Kavieng District, and the latter Namatanai District. Kavieng is a substantial little tropical town with good Government Buildings. During recent years a Government Wharf capable of berthing ships of 2,000 tons has been built.

For some years, concern has been felt at the rapid decrease of the native population of New Ireland. This was believed to be to a great extent attributable to the fact that too many men were being recruited for labour in other parts of the Territory; and for several years some parts of the island was closed against recruiting.

The Admiralty Islands comprise a small group lying about 380 miles to the north west of Rabaul, and constitute the district of Manus, with headquarters at the principal port, Lorungau, situated on the north east corner of the island of Manus, which is the largest of the group and of the same rugged mountainous type as its neighbours, New Britain and New Ireland, though apparently free from volcanoes. It is only recently that government patrols have succeeded in pushing their way right across Manus, thus gaining some idea of the interior. What rivers exist are naturally small and unimportant. Several useful though small harbours provide good anchorages for small shipping which touches at these islands.

To the north west of the Admiralty Islands, at a distance of about 200 miles, are the three small groups, the Ninigo, Hermit and Anchorite Islands, better known as the North Western Islands. A particularly fine type of native is found inhabiting these Islands. The groups contain no harbours, excepting in the lagoons at The Hermit and Ninigo Groups; and in most cases depths ranging to about 200 fathoms are found close inshore, rendering it impossible for vessels to anchor while loading copra, of which a fair quantity is produced.

It is in the waters adjacent to the Admiralty Islands that most of the shell fishing in the Territory is carried on, trochus and gold-lip being obtained in large quantities.

The Solomon Islands.—Germany’s share of the Solomon Islands consisted of the islands of Bougainville and Buka, which constitute the district of Kieta, their total area being about 3,400 square miles.

These two islands are very mountainous, particularly Bougainville, where there are found several volcanoes. Mount Balbi, a peak in the Emperor Range in the centre of the Island, with a height of over 10,000 feet, is a dormant volcano, whilst Mount Bagana, in the Crown Prince Ranges is at the present time an active crater.

There are several good harbours along the coast, the principal being Kieta on the East coast of Bougainville. This is a very well protected bay, almost landlocked, with its entrance protected by a well defined coral reef. Shipping of fair draught finds a suitable anchorage close inshore to the little town of Kieta. Other good harbours are found at Rava and Tinputs, also at Carola Haven on Buka Island.

The interior of Bougainville was practically unknown, but during 1919, it was partially explored by Australian patrols, and a well equipped expedition commenced to construct a road which will ultimately link up the Eastern and Western sides of the Island. It will then be possible to get into touch with the tribes of the interior which at present are principally notable for their aggressive attitude towards white men.

Agriculture, etc.

The Territory comprises some 60 million acres of land, most of which is capable of cultivation under tropical staples. Of this area, about 700,000 acres are alienated, and 176,460 are under cultivation.
In the many islands of the Archipelago and the North-East New Guinea, land of all kinds is to be met with, from coral atolls to granite peaks. A considerable portion is flat and comparatively low lying, with soil ranging from sand to light sandy loam, usually overlying a sub-soil of broken coral ideal for coconuts, with which much has been planted.

Larger islands, while they frequently have a margin, or at least stretches of soil similar to the above, rise into undulating foot-hills, with or without peaks and headlands. On these the soil is of a heavier nature, ranging from sedimentary deposits to rich, and in some cases, comparatively recent, volcanic soils. Still larger islands, which often have a range of hills as a backbone, and areas of swamp near the coast, have soils grading from light sand to rich heavy clays. Many of these are well watered with creeks and rivers, in the valleys of which the richest of alluvial soils are to be met with, capable of growing anything.

Not only is the Territory particularly favoured in the matter of soils and rainfall, but the fact that it is outside the cyclone and hurricane belts, enables agricultural industries to be undertaken with greater security than many places afford.

At present the Territory is entirely dependent upon the one industry of agriculture, and almost entirely on the one staple of coconuts for the manufacture of copra. There are at present, some 350 to 400 coconut plantations opened, owned and worked by Europeans, of an average area of between four and five hundred acres, scattered through the Archipelago.

Other staples being cultivated to a smaller extent are, in about the order mentioned, cocoa, rubber, coffee, tobacco, arrowroot and kapok, often in conjunction with coconuts or each other.

The mineral wealth of the islands can only be surmised. Gold is known to exist, especially in N.E. New Guinea whilst mineral oil has been found although as yet not in commercial quantities. Sulphur is obtainable, whilst it is believed that copper and nickel deposits exist. The transport difficulty has proved a very effectual bar to the efforts of prospectors up to the present; and it is only with the expenditure of considerable capital that any venture is likely to be successful until the country has been opened up.

The shell fishing industry is one that cannot be overlooked when assessing the commercial value of the colony. Large quantities of trochus, green snail, gold-lip and black-lip are obtained yearly and the revenue obtained therefrom, which includes a royalty, is considerable. The value of marine products exported from the Territory during the year ended 30th June, 1925, amounted to £7,279.

Climate and Health.

The climate, and particularly the rainfall over so widely spread a group of islands, must naturally vary considerably in different parts. Generally speaking, the rainfall is plentiful and reliable. A N.W. monsoon period between December and February; and a S.W. between March and November are experienced. The latter, during which steady trade winds occur, and the islands are seldom without a breeze, constitutes the cooler and more pleasant portion of the year. No especial dry belts exist, and droughts of more than a few months' duration are unknown.

The average rainfall for the Territory may be taken as 100 to 125 inches per annum. The following are the averages for the districts:

- Rabaul, New Britain: 86.19 inches
- Aitape, New Guinea: 86.1 inches
- Madang, New Guinea: 146.30 inches
- Kavieng, New Ireland: 123.71 inches
- Manus, Admiralty Islands: 140.14 inches
- Kokopo, New Britain: 95.70 inches
- Morobe, New Guinea: 98.60 inches
- Kieta, Bougainville: 129.59 inches
- Namatanai, New Ireland: 117.4 inches
- Gasmata, South New Britain: 254.54 inches

The following are results of observations taken at Rabaul, the capital, on the Island of New Britain, about 4½ degrees south of the equator, from 1916 to 1923:

- Shade temperature:
  - Average monthly mean: 81.3°F
- Yearly average rainfall: 86.19 ins.

Many settlers, after a few years, affirm that the climate is pleasant, and certainly the lure of the tropics is no myth to those who have the temperament. For all this, the climate is tropical, and is not to be treated with disdain. Reasonable care and the exercise of common sense, with due attention to hygiene, are necessary to avoid the effects of malaria and other tropical ailments that any neglect of precautions render practically inevitable.

Malarial fever offers the principal obstacle to white colonists in this territory, some parts of the islands being more subject to the ravages of the fever than others. The efforts of the Australian medical authorities have met with great success, and the percentage of people suffering regularly from malaria has gradually decreased from year to year. In Rabaul, where much work has been performed on sanitation and bush clearing around the town, the malarial carrier, the anopheline mosquito, has been almost eliminated, with the result that malaria cases are at present few and far between. The man who suffers is of course the planter living in places remote from the activities of the medical authorities. Elephantiasis makes an appearance occasionally amongst the native population; and, as is the case in most tropical countries, dysentery and tubercular diseases yearly claim a number of victims from the colored races.

Constant care has to be exercised to prevent the introduction of epidemic diseases, such as smallpox, influenza or measles, the latter of which, while comparatively harmless among white races, becomes calamitously destructive among the careless living slightly clad natives.

Native Population.

Head-taxes are collected every year and a census is taken regularly in the parts of the Territory under Government influence. The total native population is estimated at 378,701. The non-native population is 3,132.

Generally speaking the New Guinea aborigine is of a good type, well built, and, when civilised, very amenable to discipline. As a rule he is fairly stolid, though flashes of brilliance are found amongst members of some of the tribes. In every island the different branches or tribes appear to be innumerable, and even at short distances it is found that great physical differences occur in the types; while tribes only ten or twelve miles from
each other often speak totally different dialects. The result is that interpretation is very difficult for travellers or for the natives amongst themselves, but throughout the colony the use of "pidgin" English has become so established, that even the Germans spoke "pidgin" English to their labourers. Natives are recruited for many purposes; they make good plantation labourers, boats' crews, or domestic servants, whilst many who have received special training have become adept artisans. The German Government had commenced a technical school for natives at Rabaul. This school has been continued by the Australian Authorities who have also established an Elementary School and a school for half-caste children.

Work of this nature is also carried out by the Missions.

Communications.

Between Rabaul and the various islands a line of small steamers maintains a regular service, carrying mails and stores to the outlying districts, and loading with copra, etc., for transhipment at Rabaul, prior to shipment to Australia.

Regular communication is maintained to and from Australia by a three-weekly shipping service.

Telegraphic communication is well maintained throughout the group by a system of wireless stations, some of which had been installed by the German Government.

DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba) were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and Athabaska were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 255,285 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 251,700 square miles.

By Federal Act passed in the Session of 1912, the boundaries of the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba were extended. Ontario was enlarged by 146,400 square miles, Quebec by 354,961, and Manitoba by 178,100.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1536 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate now consists of 96 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 represent Ontario, 24 Quebec, 24 the Maritime Provinces, and 24 the Western Provinces. The qualification for Senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of not less than thirty years, British nationality and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is at present 245; 82 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 14 Nova Scotia, 11 New Brunswick, 17 Manitoba, 14 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 16 Alberta, 21 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each
province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $4,000 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $4,000 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council or Cabinet possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. The territory not comprised within any province (Yukon and the North-West Territories) is very thinly inhabited. The Yukon Territory is governed by an appointed Gold Commissioner and an elective council of three members. The Northwest Territories are governed by a Commissioner and six councillors appointed by the Governor-General in Council.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures. The Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, naturalisation, and Indian affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head. Each Province also received an annual allowance for Government.

The Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, whose public debts were less, proportionally, at the Union than that of the old Province of Canada became entitled to receive an interest allowance, payable half-yearly, on the difference between their respective debts and certain stipulated amounts.

The annual subsidies granted to the several provinces were revised by Imperial enactment (1907), with the following effect:

(a) A fixed grant according to population:
Where population is—

| Population | Grant |
|------------|-------|
| Under 150,000 | $100,000 |
| 150,000 but does not exceed 200,000 | $150,000 |
| 200,000 | $400,000 |
| 400,000 | $800,000 |
| 800,000 | $1,500,000 |
| over 1,500,000 | $220,000 |

(b) A grant at the rate of 80 cents per head of the population of the province up to 2,500,000, and at the rate of 60 cents per head of so much of the population as exceeds that number.

(c) An additional grant of $100,000 yearly to the province of British Columbia for a period of ten years, from 1907.

In lieu of public lands in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which the Dominion retains, each province receives until its population reaches 400,000, an annual sum of $375,000, payable half-yearly; thereafter until the population reaches 800,000, an annual sum of $562,500; thereafter until the population reaches 1,200,000, $750,000; thereafter the sum payable shall be $1,125,000.

Each of these two provinces, inasmuch as they were not in debt at the time (1906) of their statutory creation, are entitled to be paid half-yearly, in advance, an annual sum of $405,375.

By chapter 32 of the Acts of the Parliament of Canada, 1912, the boundaries of the Province of Manitoba were extended northward to the 60th parallel of north latitude, and eastward to the shores of Hudson Bay, the area of the enlarged province as a result approximating the respective areas of the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In consequence of this enlargement allowances from the Federal Treasury practically identical in amount and upon the same basis as the allowances or grants to Alberta and Saskatchewan, as recited in the preceding paragraphs became payable to the Province of Manitoba.

By chapter 42 of the Acts of 1912, an additional annual grant of one hundred thousand dollars was made to the Province of Prince Edward Island.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland. Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises:

(a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 miles square (in the Prairie Provinces 6 miles square); (b) villages with a population over 750; (c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised
within a large district, called a county, constitute (d) the county municipality; (e) cities in the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 10,000 and 15,000 respectively. In the other provinces they are incorporated under certain Municipal Codes and Acts. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councillors; the towns by a mayor and councillors, and the cities by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,797,123 square miles (31 times the area of the United Kingdom, or four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion (including territory added to the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba) comprise a little over 1,773,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands on the west.

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. "Homesteads" of 160 acres can be obtained without any payment, and the process of settlement on the land in the west is rapidly going on; about 35 per cent. of the population is engaged in agriculture, and 3,969 "homesteads" were granted in the calendar year 1925. In 1925 there were 3,016 butter and cheese factories and 24 factories producing condensed milk and cream. In 1925 the quantity of creamery butter made was 183,524,314 lbs., valued at $63,658,167, and the quantity of cheese made was 177,139,113 lbs., valued at $36,671,556. The value of land, buildings and plant was $44,307,558. The number of persons employed in factories during the year was 11,334, and the amount paid for salaries and wages was $11,513,198.

Canadian manufacturing has grown steadily to reach the stage indicated by the table which follows. The utilization of hydro-electric power in Ontario and Quebec, which lack coal, is an important phase of the recent development.

The imports for home consumption from the United States in 1925-26 were $609,718,624. $133,125,438 of dutiable goods were imported from the United Kingdom.
By an Agreement concluded in 1925 between the British and Canadian Governments greatly reduced fares to Canada became available as from January 1st, 1926, for women proceeding to the Dominion as household workers, and for approved families, and single men proceeding under agreement to work on the land. The scale of fares varies from £3 to East Coast centres, e.g., Halifax, Quebec City, to £9 to Vancouver. In certain special cases settlers under this Agreement may receive a loan of the difference between the minimum fare of £3 and the fare to the distributing centre in the Dominion to which they are proceeding. Officers of the Land Settlement Branch of the Canadian Government will supervise migrants proceeding under this scheme for a period of five years after their arrival and will afford them free advice, instruction and any assistance possible.

Products.

The total yield of wheat in Canada for the year 1925 was returned as 387,956,000 bushels from 21,972,732 acres. The average yield per acre for Canada was 18·7 bushels. For oats the production was 513,384,000 bushels from 14,672,320 acres. The average yield per acre was 35·0 bushels. Barley yielded 112,668,300 bushels from 4,075,995 acres, the average yield per acre being 27·6 bushels. Flaxseed gave a total yield of 9,297,100 bushels from 1,128,100 acres. The yield per acre was 8·2 bushels. For the remaining grain crops the total yields and average yields per acre were in bushels as follows:—Rye, 13,688,900, average 16·0; peas, 3,410,700, average 18·6; beans, 1,500,700, average 18·4; buckwheat, 10,448,800, average 22·5; mixed grains, 34,301,000, average 38·6; husking corn, 10,564,300, average 44·2.

Turnips, mangolds, etc., yielded 36,868,000 cwts. from 204,376 acres, an average of 180·4 cwts. per acre. Sugar beets yielded 458,200 tons from 43,418 acres, or 10·5 tons per acre. The yield of hay and clover was 16,141,200 tons from 10,097,042 acres. The average yield per acre is 1·60 tons. Grain hay yielded 4,438,000 tons from 1,494,911 acres, the average being 2·97 tons per acre. Alfalfa yielded 1,640,200 tons from 655,567 acres, or an average of 2·50 per acre.

The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The value of the yield in the calendar year 1925 was $47,942,131, and the number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries was 73,855.

The principal minerals produced in 1925 were coal $49,261,951; copper, $15,649,882; gold, $35,880,826; silver, $13,971,150; nickel, $15,946,672; natural gas, $6,833,005; lead, $23,127,460; asbestos, $8,988,380; zinc, $8,328,446; gypsum, $2,389,891; cobalt, $2,328,517; salt, $1,410,697; cement, $14,046,704. The total production of minerals was $226,583,333.

The pulp and paper industry made satisfactory progress in 1925; there were 114 mills in operation, and the value of pulpwood exported, pulp exported, and paper manufactured was $202,782,017.

A century ago the value of the furs exported was greater than that of any other product. Canada is still the great fur preserve of the world; furs to the value of $17,432,440 were exported in the fiscal year 1926.
The value of lumber production in 1924 was $104,444,622. The timber on about two-thirds of the forest area is either too small or too far from transportation facilities to be worked profitably under present conditions.

Shipping.

The arrivals and clearances show, in the year 1925, a total tonnage of 158,553,870 tons. Engaged in sea going trade, 40,981,026 tons; 80,619,819 tons engaged in coasting trade, and 36,958,026 tons engaged on inland waters between Canada and the United States.

The number of vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1924, was 7,689, with a net tonnage of 1,221,020. Of this number 4,499 were steamers, with a gross tonnage of 1,263,218. The estimated number of men and boys employed was over 50,000.

Shipping figures in 1926 were as follows:

| Nation- | Entered. | Cleared. |
|---------|----------|----------|
|         | No. Vessels. | Tons Register. | No. Vessels. | Tons Register. |
| British | 3,250     | 9,025,869 | 3,265     | 8,723,198 |
| Canadian| 8,830     | 5,075,577 | 9,076     | 4,801,477 |
| Foreign | 9,105     | 9,096,274 | 9,012     | 9,292,601 |
| TOTAL   | 21,185    | 23,197,720| 21,353    | 22,817,276|

On March 31st, 1925, the number of lights shown was 1,654, lightships 10, and fog-alarm stations, 13; the number of fog whistles 8, hand fog horns, fog bells, etc., was 511; the number of gas buoys, whistling buoys, bell buoys, and submarine bells, 330; the number of light keepers and engineers of fog-alarms, with masters of lightships, was over 1,000.

Railways.

Railways.—The total railway mileage in Canada on December 31st, 1925, was 40,362 miles. On the same date the capital liability was $3,471,080,909. Of this amount $1,378,706,860 represents stocks, and $2,092,374,049 funded debt.

During the year ended December 31st, 1925, the steam railways carried 41,458,084 passengers and 109,850,925 tons of freight. The total earnings during the year were $445,297,288. The operating expenses were $372,149,656 as against $382,483,908 in the previous year.

The aid granted in the form of cash subsidies, loans, subscription to shares, etc., by the Dominion and Provincial Governments and Municipalities up to December 31st, 1925, is as follows:

Dominion Government:
- Cash subsidies ... ... ... $118,440,390
- Loans ... ... ... ... ... 15,142,633
Cost of Lines handed over to
- C.P.R. ... ... ... ... ... 37,790,025
Paid to Quebec Government ... ... ... 5,160,053

Total ... ... ... ... ... $176,533,101

Provincial Governments ... ... ... $33,048,165
Municipalities ... ... ... ... ... 12,888,128

Grand Total ... ... ... ... ... $222,469,394

The Dominion and Provincial Governments have also made land grants amounting to 47,187,037 acres.

The implement clause of the Grand Trunk Pacific agreement provides that the Government shall make up the difference between the amount realised in certain bonds and their par value. Since 1886 the aid granted to other railways includes the sum of $10,189,521 paid by the Government to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for land taken over by the Government from the Company's land subsidy.

On September 20th, 1917, an Act was passed authorising the Dominion Government to take over the Stock of the Canadian Northern System. This was appraised and finally acquired for $9,733,333 and the road taken over in September, 1919, and operated by the Government, through a Board of Directors.

In 1918 certain branch lines in New Brunswick were taken over by the Dominion Government, and during 1920 the Lotbiniere and Megantic, Caraquet and Gulf Short, Cape Breton, and Quebec and Saguenay also became part of the Government railways. The system known as the Canadian Government Railways, to distinguish from the Canadian Northern system, both systems comprising the Canadian National Railways, now includes the Intercolonial, National Transcontinental, Prince Edward Island and the several small lines, and operated in 1921 a total of 4,535 miles (including trackage rights). The Canadian Government Railways also operated under contract the St. John and Quebec Railway with 172.07 miles of track.

In 1920 the Government took over control of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and branch lines as receiver, and during the same month entered into an agreement with the Grand Trunk Railway Company whereby the Government agreed to acquire the preference and common stock of the company, the value to be determined by arbitration and to guarantee payment of dividends on the present guaranteed stock amounting to $12,500,000, and payment of interest upon the present debenture stock aggregating $11,926,126.

In 1923 the whole of the preference and common stock of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, was, by Order in Council, vested in the Minister of Finance in trust for His Majesty.

In the same year an Order in Council was passed handing over to the Canadian National Railway Board the management and operation of the Canadian Government Railways, designated specifically as: The Intercolonial Railway, The National Transcontinental Railway, The Lake Superior branch, leased from the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, The Prince Edward Island Railway, The Hudson Bay Railway, and all other railways and branch lines vested in His Majesty, and comprising what has been known as the Canadian Government Railways. This Order in Council superseded and cancelled the Order in Council of November 20th, 1918, which had appointed the Canadian Northern Board to operate and manage these railways.

The unification of the Grand Trunk and Canadian National Railways was provided for by Order in Council of January 30th, 1923, which also brought into effect the Act to incorporate the Canadian National Railway Company and respecting Canadian National Railways (Chap. 13, 1919). This was followed on February 5th, 1923, by an Order in Council establishing the head office of the Canadian National Railways at Montreal, Quebec.

The mileage operated, gross earnings, operating expenses and net operating revenue of the large
systems of Canada, of which the first five now constitute the Canadian National Railways as one system are as follows:

Canadian Government
St. John and Quebec ... (Total mileage including lines
Canadian Northern ... in United States = 22,191.77.)
Grand Trunk ... 30,851.49 miles of single track
Grand Trunk Pacific ...
Canadian Pacific ... 13,780.90

Total ... (1926 mileage excluding track operated under trackage rights only and other duplications.)

The total single track mileage operated in Canada was 40,352.

| Gross Earnings | Operating Expenses | Operating Revenue |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Canadian Government | $306,218,920 | $184,373,201 | $23,845,719 |
| Canadian Northern | | | |
| Grand Trunk | | | |
| Grand Trunk Pacific | | | |
| Canadian Pacific | 182,610,791 | 140,863,058 | 41,947,733 |

Totals ... 390,829,711 325,036,259 65,793,452

The Canadian National lines and the Canadian Pacific, the latter with 13,761 miles of track—comprise 85% of the total mileage in Canada and form three transcontinental systems. The Canadian Pacific main line extends from St. John to Vancouver, about 3,367 miles. The former Intercolonial and Canadian Northern main line extend from Halifax to Vancouver via Edmonton, while the Intercolonial from Halifax to Moncton, with the Transcontinental and Grand Trunk Pacific from Moncton to Prince Rupert, constitutes the third great transcontinental railway.

Telegraphs.

There were in 1925, 52,723 miles of telegraph line, and 284,121 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 13,913, including 356 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 14,183,988 land messages were sent in 1925 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 4,664. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. Wireless Telegraphy.—At March 31st, 1925, there were 93,049 Radio-telegraph and wireless stations in Canada (including private receiving stations). At Glace Bay, Cape Breton, N.S., and at Montreal, there are long distance stations with ranges of 3,000 and 7,000 nautical miles; five at Vancouver, B.C., with a range of 7,000 nautical miles; and also at Louisbourg, N.S., Laprairie, Que., and Markham, Ont., with a range of 1,000 nautical miles. Twenty-three Government steamers are equipped with wireless apparatus having ranges of 100 to 1,000 miles. The telephone is very generally used. On the 31st December, 1924, there were 1,072,454 telephones and 2,793,596 miles of telephone wire in use. The revenue amounted to $44,322,598, and the operating expenses to $33,615,886. On December 31st, 1924, the capital liability of telephone companies in Canada was $160,015,020, of which $63,798,133 are stocks and $96,216,887 are funded debt.

There were, on December 31st, 1924, 881 companies generating electric power and 944 selling electric power in Canada.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. From Lake Superior to the sea there is water passage nowhere less than 14 feet deep. The total length of canals proper open is 1,894 miles (of which 117.2 are constructed canals), but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts for the year ending March 31st, 1926, were $913,075, and the working expenses, including repairs were $1,812,592. Over $163,000,000 has been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault Ste. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not been reimposed.

Total vessel tonnage through the canals during 1925 was 18,789,709, carrying 208,692 passengers, and 14,130,667 tons of freight.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars and cents, $4.86 being equal at par to one pound sterling. For convenience in reckoning, especially in taxation, the mill, one-tenth of a cent, is used, although it is not a unit of currency. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States as well as British gold coins are legal tender.

The Ottawa Branch of the Royal Mint was established in pursuance of The Ottawa Mint Act, 1901 (1 Edw. VII., c. 4), under which an annual sum not exceeding $75,000 is payable to the Imperial Treasury for the purpose of defraying the salaries of officials and other expenses of the Mint, the fees and all sums received being retained by Canada.

Memorandum of silver and bronze coin struck and issued by the Ottawa Mint during the calendar years:

| Description of Coins | 1924 | 1925 |
|----------------------|------|------|
| Silver               |      |      |
| Bronze               | 15,963.88 | 11,900.00 |

The Mint issues silver, nickel and copper coins for circulation in Canada.

The Dominion Government and Postal Savings Banks, on March 31st, 1926, had $32,830,544 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit on March 31st, 1926, $67,241,344. In addition all the 11 chartered banks have savings departments, in which the deposits are "payable after notice or on a fixed day." The average amount of such deposits for 1926 was $1,269,542,584.

The following banks were established in Canada, Oct. 31st, 1926:

† Excluding capital and rest or reserve fund.

In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of small denominations (and of large denominations for the use of the banks only) and the average monthly circulation in 1890 amounted to $15,501,360, and at March 31st, 1925, to $182,583,404. Under the Dominion Notes Act 1914 (5 Geo. V. c. 4), the Dominion Government is authorized to issue notes up to and including $50,000,000 against a reserve in gold equal to one quarter of the amount. By Chapter 4, Acts of 1915, "an Act respecting the issue of Dominion Notes," the Dominion Government is authorized to issue notes up to $26,000,000 without any reserve of gold, $16,000,000 of the notes to be against certain specified Canadian railway securities guaranteed by the Dominion Government. Notes may be issued to any additional amount in excess of $76,000,000, but (except as provided by the Finance Act, 1914) an amount of gold equal to the excess must be held. Thus Dominion notes are under normal conditions gold certificates. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government. In 1912, the Dominion Government issued five-dollar notes for the first time.

**Post Office.**

The number of offices on March 31st, 1925, was 12,376. The net revenue for the year ended March 31st, 1925, was $28,581,993, and the expenditure $29,873,802. At the end of the fiscal year 1924-25, there were about 3,784 rural mail delivery routes, on which were erected 199,470 boxes.

On March 31, 1925, there were 5,578 Money Order offices; Orders issued, 12,435,448, value $163,519,320. During the year ended March 31, 1926, the Dominion Government paid $1,078,038 in Ocean Mail subsidies and steamship subventions.

The mail communication with Great Britain is now two or three times a week via Montreal or Quebec and New York in summer, and via Halifax or St. John and New York in winter. With the West Indies there is a fortnightly mail service via Halifax, and from three to four trips per week via United States ports. There is a through service twice a day across the continent from Halifax on the Atlantic to Vancouver on the Pacific coast by the Canadian Pacific and Intercolonial Railways, a monthly direct steam service with New Zealand and via New Zealand with Australia via Vancouver. With Japan and China there is a direct connection by steamer from Vancouver once every two weeks throughout the year.

The rates of postage are as follows:

**LETTERS.**—To Canada, Newfoundland, United States and Mexico, 2 cents for the first oz., 2 cents for each additional oz.; Great Britain and all other places within the Empire, 3 cents for the first oz., 3 cents for each additional oz.; other countries, 8 cents for the first oz., 4 cents for each additional oz.

**POSTCARDS.**—Canada, Great Britain and all other places within the Empire, United States and Mexico, 2 cents each; other countries 4 cents each.

**NEWSPAPERS.**—To Canada, United States and Mexico, and (if published in Canada) to United Kingdom and certain British Colonies, 1 cent per 4 oz.; in all other cases 2 cents per 2 oz.

There is a direct parcel post to Newfoundland, West Indies, New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Japan, Fiji, France, St. Pierre and Miquelon, British Guiana, British Honduras, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentine Republic, and the Union of South Africa, and parcel post via England to other countries.

III. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (Old Canada).

History.

It is claimed that Sebastian Cabot discovered Cape Breton Island in 1497, but the first discoverer of Canada, properly so called, was Jacques Cartier, who having spent some time in Gaspé Harbour took possession of the country by setting up a cross, on the 24th July, 1534. In 1535 he sailed up the St. Lawrence which he named the River of Hochelaga, the name applied by the Indians to the region about the Lachine Rapids.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonization were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed in the main by military authority. In the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), authorising the Crown to issue a proclamation dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-8. The risings in both Provinces were caused by Governor after Governor attempting to rule by the aid of Executive Councils not possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assemblies. The rebels were suppressed with very little difficulty. Afterwards the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. Subsequently, by 17 & 18 Vict. c. 118, the Canadian Legislature was empowered to alter the Constitution of the Legislative Council. This power was utilised in 1856 by an Act of Canada which made half of the Legislative Council elective for terms of eight years. This modification was an important one, for it was because of the dissatisfaction caused by the behaviour of the elected Councillors that, on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the new Senate was made appointive. The new House of Assembly, created in 1840, consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1854 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each Province (Ontario, 112 members; Quebec, 85 members), elected for four years in Ontario and five years in Quebec by general suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $20 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $2,000. Members in Quebec receive $2,500 for each session of more than 30 days. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $2,500 as sessional indemnity.

Industry.

The industrial wealth of Ontario is derived, primarily, from its farms, its forests, mines and fisheries; secondarily, from its manufactures. In 1925, the value of the farm land, buildings, implements production and live stock of the province was estimated at $2,196,152,000. There are over 22,628,901 acres of cleared farm land now occupied and over 30,000,000 acres still available. The farms average 114 acres in extent, of which 84% are owned by the occupants. The average value of farm products per acre is greater than in any other province, and the total production
of field crops was placed at $250,465,600 in 1925. Dairying and the breeding and feeding of live stock are combined with general farming. The value of the cheese and butter factory output is at present about $45,000,000 annually.

All the fruits usually grown in the temperate zone may be produced in Ontario, not only successfully, but in a very high degree of excellence. Apples constitute the principal crop, but tender fruits such as peaches, pears, plums and grapes, are very extensively grown in the Niagara peninsula. The canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables is a well established industry. Total apple production in 1925 was estimated at 1,587,848 barrels.

The value of the output of the mines and mineral industries of Ontario in 1925 was $87,992,370, as compared with $86,398,656 in 1924. This increase was due in large part to an increase in gold production of over $4,534,000. The quantity produced in 1925 was $30,202,357 as compared with $25,668,795 in 1924. In 1925, the quantity of silver produced was 10,529,131 ounces, worth $7,271,944. The quantity of nickel produced in Ontario in 1925 was 73,857,114 lbs. and copper 39,718,777 lbs. The total value of nickel produced was $15,946,672, and of copper $5,577,311. Crude petroleum amounting to 143,134 barrels was produced in 1925, with a total value of $386,555, natural gas 7,143,962, valued at $3,958,006, 2,156,441 lbs. of arsenic, valued at $113,324, as well as 3,462,358 barrels of cement, worth $5,253,911.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Cabinet for the elementary (public and separate) the continuation and high schools (including collegiate institutes) and the Vocational schools, all of which number 7,450, with 686,520 scholars (exclusive of evening school pupils) in 1924-5. The schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and five theological colleges are also affiliated. There are also two non-denominational and two denominational universities in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges (private foundations) for boys and girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile offenders of both sexes. Education, elementary and secondary, is free and is compulsory up to 16 years of age in urban centres. In rural sections it is compulsory up to 14 years. Public libraries receive Government grants.

Climate.

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°; at Montreal 42°; the extreme range at Toronto being from 22° below zero to 103°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 25 inches; at Montreal 29 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between December and March is about 122 inches on the average at Montreal.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Quebec is growing rapidly through its agriculture, its industry and its forests. The municipalities of the Province have a total area of 24,964,342 acres, which is about one-ninth of the total area, excluding the northern part (formerly Ungava), which was annexed in 1912.

Most farmers own their farms, and the chief products are hay, oats and potatoes.

The value of the field crops, for the year 1925, is estimated at $150,253,000, compared with $88,000,000 for the year previous to the war (1913).

The raising of beef cattle is a business of considerable importance in the Eastern Townships, and throughout the Province mixed farming is a general practice.

* Provincial Municipal Statistics, 1924.
Dairying is one of the most important industries on the farm. The total yield of the butter and cheese manufactured was over $30,723,790 in 1925. The butter of the Province of Quebec is renowned for its flavour, and has taken first prizes in International competitions, and the cheese commands the highest prices paid on the Montreal market by exporters to Europe.

In industrial development, Quebec has made rapid progress. The census of 1911 showed that the total value of manufactured products for 1910 was $350,901,656; during the last twelve years the growth has been quite phenomenal. A statement published by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics shows that the industrial production of Quebec for 1924 had a gross value of $776,232,244. Montreal's share of that production was $444,852,064.

Amongst the most important industries are the following: lumber, pulp, paper, shipbuilding and repairs, slaughtering and meat packing, boots and shoes, flour and grist mill products, foundries, cotton, printing and publishing, leather, fur garments, cloth, tobacco, cigars, syrup and maple sugar, drugs and chemicals, liquors and malt, paints and varnishes.

To those interested in the mining industry, the Province of Quebec offers an attractive diversity of geological formations, including the Keewatin, Laurentian and Huronion, containing gold, silver, asbestos, lead, nickel, copper, iron, zinc, phosphate, mica and granite.

In the Eastern Townships are located the well renowned mines of asbestos. Their production, which had a value of only $2,677,829 in 1910, reached in 1925 a production estimated at $8,976,645. The Province produces also several of the so called "War minerals," such as pyrite, molybdenite, magnesite, chromite, the mining of which received a very strong impetus during the hostilities. Copper and mica rank next to asbestos in production (excluding production of structural materials and clay products), with values of $200,512 and $277,083 respectively in the year 1926.

While land values, both in town and country, show a steady improvement in this Province from year to year, Quebec has never experienced the speculative crisis that have characterized real estate transactions elsewhere, especially during the years previous to the war. During the war, production was greatly intensified in the Province, and every fiscal year ended with a material surplus. Quebec was the only Province where the moratorium was not imposed during the hostilities, and its credit, on the foreign markets, instead of diminishing, during the last years was increasing, and, hence, has largely escaped the financial stringency of the after-war readjustment.

The entire school organization in the Province of Quebec is under the immediate control of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, who is under the Provincial Secretary. The Superintendent is assisted by an English Secretary and a French Secretary, who have the rank of deputy-minister. To a Council of Public Instruction is delegated certain large powers, and it is divided into two Committees, a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, and each of these Committees have the right to make the regulations in regard to the organization and discipline of their respective schools. These powers include the adopting of a programme of studies, the authorization of text books, the issuing of diplomas and all such matters as directly affect the internal management of the schools. The local control is vested in local elective boards. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1924, 8,014 schools, with 583,905 scholars. There are included in the total given above forestry schools, dairy schools, trade schools, technical schools, schools for agriculture, normal schools, a school for higher commercial studies and classical colleges, and four universities—two protestant: McGill University (Montreal) and Bishop's College (Lennoxville) and two Catholic: Laval University (Quebec) and Montreal University (Montreal).

In 1898, the schools' revenue was $3,055,771; ten years later, it amounted to $5,148,887; in 1923-24, it was $27,917,738.

The average cost of education per pupil in the Province of Quebec has increased rapidly; in 1900, it was $9.87; in 1910, $15.72; in 1924, $47.81.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between the 43rd and 47th parallels, connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 386 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 3,120 square miles. The Province is 21,428 square miles in area, a small part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the census of 1921 was 523,837.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonised by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I. in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the census of 1921 was 58,372. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. A dry dock and ship-building plant is also situated at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.
Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Dartmouth, Digby, Glace Bay, Kentville, New Glasgow, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney, Sydney Mines, North Sydney, Amherst, Lunenburg, and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney and New Glasgow, and these centres are developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production of some of the principal minerals, that are at present mined, for the calendar year 1925, is as follows:

- Coal raised ... 3,842,978 short tons.
- Gypsum ... 551,230 "
- Gold ... 1,628 ounces.

There are large deposits of other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe. The 1925 crop was estimated at 956,036 barrels, valued at $4,302,232.

A considerable quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. Their value in 1925 was $10,213,637. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent. England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and there are plants for the construction of steel ships at New Glasgow and at Halifax. A large mill for the manufacturing of steel ships' plates is operating at Sydney.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. In 1925 the mean temperature at Yarmouth was 43°, the extreme range being from 6° below zero to 79°.

**Constitution.**

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 10 Members in the Senate and 14 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (five of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 43 representatives elected every five years.

**Education.**

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1864. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by a Board of Commissioners partly appointed by the Town Council and partly by the Government.

In 1925 there were 3,062 (classrooms) schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 112,352. 4,559 attended the technical schools. Education is compulsory in towns, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 14 in rural schools and 6 and 16 in towns and cities.

Under "The Technical Education Act," of 1907, local technical schools have been established in all the larger industrial centres in order to produce a class of educated, skilled workmen for the various manufacturing industries. A central institution called the "Nova Scotia Technical College" has been established at Halifax, where instruction of a college grade is provided in mining, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The principal of this college is the Director of Technical Education.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,985 square miles, or about 17,910,400 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population in 1921, was 387,876.

History.

New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.

In 1925 the mean temperature of Fredericton was 40°3°, the extreme range being from 35° below zero to 90°5°. The average annual rainfall is 36.7 inches, and the snowfall 75.0 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 65 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 8,114 (1921)), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 47,166 (1921)). Other towns are Moncton (17,488), Campbellton (5,570), Edmundston (4,035), Chatham (4,506), Woodstock (3,380), St. Stephen (3,452), and Newcastle (3507).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 11 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 48 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $1,000 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were in 1925, 2,275 (classrooms) schools and 80,145 scholars, exclusive of schools for teacher training, which had an enrolment of 480.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville and Memramcook.

MANITOBA.

Area and Situation.

Manitoba became a Province of the Canadian Federation by legislative enactments taking effect on the 15th July, 1870. It is bounded on the north by the 60th parallel of latitude; on the west by the Eastern boundary of the Province of Saskatchewan; on the south by the United States; on the east by the western boundary of the Province of Ontario to Hudson's Bay, and by Hudson's Bay for a distance of 300 miles.

The area of Manitoba is 251,832 square miles, of which 232,000 square miles are land and about 20,000 square miles are water.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced.

Manitoba No. 1 Northern, because of its superior milling qualities, is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous. Winnipeg is now the leading grain market on the Continent. There is a steady trend toward diversified agriculture in Manitoba and but few farmers now confine their activities solely to grain growing.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle, bacon and dairy products. In 1925, agricultural production included:

The average yield of wheat per acre for four years is 16'2 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased from $12 to $50 per acre.
The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1871 it contained about 241 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of 7,985; in 1896, 35,000; and in 1926 it was 191,366. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, St. Boniface, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Minnedosa, Morden, Manitou, Dauphin, Transcona, Souris, Virden, Morden and Pas. Population of Manitoba, 1921, 610,118; and in 1926 it was 639,000 (provisional figures).

Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful. A sand suitable for glass is found in great quantities. Gold, copper and other valuable minerals have been discovered in great quantities in different parts of the province, particularly in the new territory North of the Saskatchewan River, also to the East of Lake Winnipeg. Development, retarded by the war, is proceeding apace, and Manitoba, hitherto regarded as an agricultural province, gives every promise of becoming an important mining province.

Manufacturing industries are becoming numerous in Winnipeg, the net annual output having grown from $8,616,248 in 1901 to $41,361,438 in the calendar year 1924. There were then 768 factories, employing over 14,778 workers, with a capital invested of $102,252,013.

The Winnipeg Power Plant on the Winnipeg River, 77 miles from the City of Winnipeg, now develops about 73,000 h.p. and is capable of developing 110,000 h.p., is owned and operated by the City. The cost of power energy is from 1/2 to 3 cents per K.W. hour, and household lighting is supplied at 2½ to 3 cents per K.W. hour. The plant is being increased at a cost of nearly $2,000,000. The Winnipeg Electric Railway has a development of 35,000 h.p. on the Pinawa Channel of the Winnipeg River; also the Manitoba Power Company has a development of 168,000 h.p. capacity, of which 2 units of 28,000 h.p. each have been installed.

Railway Facilities.

In the year 1879 there was no railway in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains. At the close of 1925 there were in the province of Manitoba 4,520 miles of steam railways in operation. These railways afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.

Climate.

In 1925 the mean temperature at Winnipeg was 36.6° the extreme range being from 31.0° below zero to 93.0°. The climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual precipitation at Winnipeg is 20.42 inches.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 6 members in the Dominion Senate and 17 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 55 members elected by adult suffrage, for 5 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876. The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $1,500 per session.

Education.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, a system of schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 6 and 21 years, and in cities, towns and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school." Attendance is compulsory to the age of 14.

In 1925 there were 1,991 school houses employing 3,213 teachers and with an enrolment of 145,834 pupils. There are 48 high schools, 9 junior high schools, 10 collegiate departments, 11 collegiate institutes and 119 intermediate schools, i.e. high schools with one teacher devoting full time to high school work. Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled The University of Manitoba, which had 2,273 full course students in 1925-26 and in addition many short course students. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical. Brandon College, which is affiliated with McMaster University, does university work. Manitoba also has an Agricultural College, which in 1924-25 had 244 long course and 266 short course students.
