BRITISH HONDURAS

British Honduras lies on the east coast of Central America, bounded by the Mexican province of Quintana Roo in the north and Guatemala in the west and south. Its area is 8,867 square miles, which includes a number of islands, known as "cays", lying off the coast, whose total area is 212 square miles.

The population is 70,741 and comprises 34,838 males and 35,903 females (1951 estimate). According to the last census of 1946, when the total population was 59,220, the distribution by racial groups was:

- Creoles: 41,053
- American Indians (Maya): 10,030
- Caribs: 4,112
- White: 2,329
- East Indians: 1,366
- Syrians: 128
- Chinese: 50
- Race not stated: 152

The northern and western districts are predominantly Spanish speaking.

The coastline is, for the most part, flat and swampy, but the country rises gradually towards the interior. The chief mountain ranges are the Maya Mountains and the Cockscombs in the south, which reach a height of 3,700 feet, and the Mountain Pine Ridge in the west. Characteristic soils in the Colony are cohune ridge (the vegetable alluvium along the river valleys), and pine ridge (sandy tracts covered with pines, scrub, and wiry grass). There are also large areas of savannah, mountain forest and high rain forest soils.

The climate is sub-tropical with a dry season from the middle of March to the end of May, and a short dry spell in August and September. The average rainfall over the past few years has been:

| District          | Inches |
|-------------------|--------|
| Belize            | 62     |
| Northern District | 47     |
| Southern District | 172    |

The hottest months are May to October, when the shade temperature rises to a maximum of 96° with a high humidity; the minimum is 50°.

On 10th September, 1931, Belize was visited by a hurricane and tidal wave which caused great damage and loss of life.

The principal towns are:

- Belize (capital): 21,886
- Corozal: 2,190
- Orange Walk: 1,395
- Cayo: 1,548
- Stann Creek: 3,414
- Punta Gorda: 1,375

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, about 1638, by adventurers who were attracted by the logwood which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were for a long time at St. George's Cay. The Spaniards frequently endeavoured to expel the logcutters; but though they succeeded in driving them from the northern coast of Yucatan about 1717, they failed to dislodge them from the eastern coast.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito Coast in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers. Their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protection and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Ruatan and at Black River on the mainland. Ruatan was abandoned in 1749 but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements on the Mosquito Coast. As a result of the Treaty of Paris in 1763 the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay", the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms. By the Treaty of Versailles of 1783 Spain recognized a district (within what is now British Honduras) within which the British logcutters might work without interference; and by the Convention of London signed in 1786 it was agreed that the British colonists should evacuate the Mosquito Coast and the adjacent islands. In spite of these treaties many of the settlers remained outside the agreed limits and it was not until the treaties of 1859, with the Republic of Honduras, and 1860, with Nicaragua, that the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast were finally recognized as belonging to those states, Nicaragua agreeing to allow the Mosquito Indians autonomy in the Reserve which was assigned to them.

The present constitution allows for a Legislative Council of 14 members with the Governor as President; three ex-officio members; four unofficial members nominated by the Governor; and six unofficial members elected by the five constituencies (the Belize district elects two and the other districts one each).

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members, and four nominated unofficial members.

The Legislative Council has now recommended to the Secretary of State that a new constitution should be brought into force in the Colony. This constitution, if approved, will allow for universal adult suffrage, a Legislative Council of 15 members, nine of whom will be elected, three nominated and three ex-officio; and an Executive Council consisting of three official members and six members elected by the Legislative Council, two of whom will be nominated members.

Income tax is levied on a graduated scale rising from 5% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 35% on all income over $19,000. Surtax is levied on the first $5,000 in excess of $10,000 of chargeable income at the rate of 10% and the next $5,000 at the rate of 15% and on the remainder 20%. Deductions allowed against income are a personal allowance of $500, plus allowances for wife, children, dependent relatives, life assurance premium and earned income.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure | Grants-in-aid included |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1938 | $1,740,602 | $1,872,413 | —                     |
| 1939 | $1,967,662 | $1,967,842 | $227,610              |
| 1946 | $2,637,502 | $2,552,357 | $80,600               |
| 1947 | $2,941,158 | $2,909,985 | —                     |
| 1948 | $3,208,623 | $3,394,916 | $100,750              |
| 1949 | $3,711,232 | $3,847,374 | $339,800              |
| 1950 | $5,360,473 | $5,415,753 | $820,000              |
| 1951 | $4,883,952 | $4,441,305 | —                     |
It was estimated that in 1951 approximately 41% of revenue was derived from Customs duty and 24% from internal taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Administration: 35-87%
- Social Services: 18-58%
- Public Works: 14-2%

As a result of the favourable position of the budget in recent years the Colony no longer applies for a general grant-in-aid from the Imperial Treasury and has in consequence been virtually released from Treasury control.

The Public Debt of the Colony at the end of 1951 amounted to $1,452,507, of which $244,875 was in respect of borrowings made locally. Sinking funds in hand amounted to $392,080 leaving $1,060,427 as the net outstanding debt, but of this debt over $350,000 was in respect of amounts re-loaned to municipal, quasi-government bodies, and government servants. During 1951 two loans were raised by the issue of local debentures, $75,000 under the Belize Electricity Loan Ordinance, 1950, and $75,000 under the Public Officers' Building Scheme Loan Ordinance, 1951.

The unit of currency is the British Honduras dollar which is exchanged at four to the £ sterling. Notes of $10, $5, $2, and $1 are issued and there is a silver coinage of 50, 25 and 10 cents, a nickel coin of 5 cents, and a bronze coin of 1 cent.

British Honduras received an allocation of £600,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds in 1945, followed by a further £850,000 as a result of recommendations in the Evans report in 1949. In 1952 a further £800,000 was allocated to the Colony to finance the next stage of development, which is primarily in the field of agriculture. The Plan, which includes also loan funds of about £600,000, covers a four-year programme; and in addition to the funds voted to agriculture, substantial allocations have also been made for the consolidation of internal communications, the expansion and improvement of the electricity supply in Belize, re-afforestation, and social services.

The Colonial Development Corporation also have a number of projects in the Colony. In the Stann Creek Valley 1,800 acres of bananas were planted and the first shipments were made in November 1951. In the Western District a project for the development of the livestock industry proved unsuccessful and was abandoned during the early part of 1952. Also in the Western District, a successful experiment has been made in the production of ramie fibre. In the capital, the Corporation has nearly completed construction of the Fort George Hotel (35 bedrooms).

The Citrus Company of British Honduras continues to expand the cultivation of citrus—mainly oranges—in the Stann Creek Valley.

Primary education is principally through subsidized denominational schools controlled by a Board of Education. There are three Government and 89 grant-aided primary schools and 23 unaided schools with an enrolment of 11,886. Secondary education is limited to five secondary schools, all in the capital, with an enrolment of 1,930. In January 1952 a technical high school was opened in Belize as a result of a Colonial Development and Welfare grant. There is no provision for education of university standard but a scholarship is awarded bi-annually which carries the recipient to the University College of the West Indies.

The approved estimate of expenditure on education for 1952 was $350,388 compared with $71,175 in 1935.

The Colony is relatively free of endemic disease. Malaria, which is most prevalent, has shown a substantial decrease in incidence owing to the bi-annual spraying with DDT undertaken by U.N.I.C.E.F. The main hospital is in Belize and there are hospitals in each of the five districts. Beds total 218. In 1951 there were 6,823 admissions to Belize and district hospitals and the out-patients department of the Belize hospital recorded 40,713 attendances. Eleven rural dispensaries in the more important villages are each in charge of a qualified rural health nurse.

The approved estimate of expenditure on the medical services for 1952 was $437,307 compared with $80,071 in 1935.

Stanley Field, ten miles north-west of Belize, is the principal airport of the Colony. International air services are operated to the Colony by the following airlines:

- British West Indian Airways (BWIA).
- Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (TACA).
- Empresa Guatemalteca De Aviacion (AVIATECA).
- TACA International Airlines, S.A.

There is a weekly service between Jamaica and Belize and a bi-weekly service between Belize and New Orleans. Other direct services are to Spanish Honduras and Guatemala. The British Colonial Airlines have recently established an internal air service linking three of the district capitals with Belize.

There are 2744 miles of all-weather main roads in the Colony and a further 22 miles under construction. In addition there are 84 miles of feeder roads suitable for motor traffic, 11 miles of cart roads usable by motor traffic in the dry season only, and 123 miles of Government-maintained bush trails.

The only regular passenger ship service is supplied by the Cayman Shipping Company which operates small vessels fortnightly between Belize and Kingston, Jamaica. The Jamaica Producer Company make calls approximately every three weeks at Stann Creek (from Kingston). A cargo service is provided from the U.S.A. by the United Fruit Company, and T. and J. Harrison, Limited, provide an irregular service from the United Kingdom. In 1951, 654 ships, with a tonnage of 155,149, entered the Colony with cargoes.

A most important means of internal communication is provided by the rivers. The most significant is the River Belize, or Old River, down which large quantities of timber are floated. The New River in the north and the Temash and Sarstoon Rivers in the south also provide good waterways.

The Government operates a small broadcasting service, with a power of 250 watts, which provides about two hours' programmes a day. Under a Colonial Development and Welfare grant preparations are being made for the building of two transmitters in Belize, one 1 kw. medium wave transmitter and one 5 kw. short wave transmitter. It is hoped that these will be operating early in 1953 and will provide a good broadcasting service throughout the Colony. There were 1,434 licensed listening sets in the Colony at the end of 1951.
The numbers engaged in the principal occupations at the 1946 census were:

- Agriculture: 5,865
- Manufacture and Repair: 2,551
- Forestry: 2,040
- Personal Service: 1,879
- Trade and Finance: 1,716
- Public Service: 1,357

Membership of trade unions totalled 6,503, an increase of 1,800 over the past twelve months. There are six trade unions in the Colony, of which the most important is the General Workers' Union with a nominal membership of over 5,000.

Corn, beans and peas, rice, cassava, and yams are the principal food crops of the Colony. The main export crops are coconuts, citrus fruits, sugar and bananas. Livestock is becoming more prominent in the country's economy. A cattle industry is being developed in the Western District while pigs and poultry are raised throughout the Colony. Timber is the principal export product.

Fisheries are becoming increasingly important and an export trade to the United States in lobsters has been built up.

Of industries, sawmilling is the most important, and there are a cigarette factory, a soap factory, and several small furniture factories operating in Belize.

The chief imports are vehicles, motor spirits, machinery, cotton and artificial silk piece goods, beans and peas, condensed milk, flour, butter and lard substitutes.

A Marketing Board is established in the Colony, and its principal concern is with the purchase of agricultural produce such as rice, corn and beans, at guaranteed prices and the marketing of these products. It also makes seasonal crop loans.

There are 19 Credit Unions, two Co-operative Stores, a Housing Co-operative, and a Chicle Producers' Co-operative Society.
