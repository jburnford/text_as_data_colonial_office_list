BRITISH GUIANA

British Guiana lies on the north-east coast of the South American Continent. Its area is 83,000 square miles, divided into three counties as follows—

| County       | Square miles |
|--------------|--------------|
| Essequibo    | 61,660       |
| Berbice      | 16,920       |
| Demerara     | 4,420        |

At 31st December, 1951, the population was 437,022, comprising the following racial groups—

| Race                  | Population |
|-----------------------|------------|
| East Indians          | 197,696    |
| African descent       | 158,940    |
| Mixed descent (Coloured) | 46,855   |
| Amerindians           | 17,424     |
| Portuguese            | 8,712      |
| Europeans other than Portuguese | 3,865 |
| Chinese               | 3,527      |
| Others                | 3          |

Geographically the Colony may be divided into three zones, viz., the low-lying coastland, the mountain region and the intermediate region. The coastland comprises a low-lying, swampy strip of marine alluvium which varies in width from about ten miles in the west to about 40 miles in the east. Its flat, grassy savannahs would mostly be inundated during the rainy season but for artificial drainage and sea defences. Almost the whole of the population and agricultural activity of the Colony is concentrated between the Pomeroon River and Corantyne River along this strip. The mountain region, known as the Pakaraima Range, lies along the western boundary.
of the Colony. Mount Roraima, a plateau 22 square miles in extent and over 9,000 feet above sea level, is the highest elevation. The intermediate region, the largest area of the Colony, lies mainly to the east and south. It is almost entirely forest clad. The total area under forest is approximately 70,000 square miles.

There are many large rivers which with their numerous tributaries form a vast network of waterways. All the large rivers are impeded above the tideway by rapids, cataracts and falls. Kaieteur, one of the largest single-drop waterfalls in the world, is situated on the Potaro River. It is nearly five times the height of Niagara and has a vertical drop of 741 feet with a further 80 feet of rapids and falls. Its width varies from 350 to 400 feet.

The climate is pleasant for the greater part of the year; it is hot only in the summer months. The mean temperature is $80.3^\circ$ ($82.6^\circ$ in the interior). There are two wet and two dry seasons in the coastal regions—the long wet season usually from April to August and the long dry season from September to mid-November. This is followed by wet weather towards the end of January, and the short dry season until April. The rainfall average is about 90 inches in the coastal belt and 59 inches in the savannahs. In the savannahs the dry season is October to February and the wet season May to August. The nights are uniformly cool.

Slight earth tremors are felt occasionally, but no damage is caused.

The City of Georgetown, Demerara, is the capital and has a population of 87,279. New Amsterdam, Berbice, has a population of 12,258.

In history there are really five Guianas—Spanish Guiana (now Venezuela), Portuguese Guiana (now Brazil), French, British and Dutch Guiana (now Surinam). Guiana is an Amerindian word that means "the land of waters", and there are few countries whose history has been more greatly influenced by the hydrographic factor. A navigable river was so important to the Europeans who first visited the coastline between the Amazon and the Orinoco that they gave the Amerindian name of the river to the surrounding countryside. Thus the three counties are named after the Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice rivers and the areas known as Rupununi, Mazaruni, Potaro, Cuyuni, Pomeroon, Corentyne, take their names from the rivers that flow through them. The coastline of the country between the rivers was first traced by Spanish sailors in 1499 and 1500. The territory was first partially settled in 1616 by Dutch merchants, who erected a fort and depot in the present county of Essequibo. This colony subsequently came under the control of the Dutch West Indian Company.

The first English attempt at settlement in this area was made in 1604 on the O'apock River (now French Guiana). Though followed up in 1613 and 1627, the effort failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, founded a settlement in Surinam in 1630. This was captured by the Dutch in 1667 and ceded to them at the Peace of Breda in exchange for New York. The Dutch retained their hold on the three colonies with more or less firmness, now yielding to England and now to France or Portugal, until 1796, when during the war of the French Revolution, the colonies were captured by a British fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain and finally ceded to her in 1804.

In 1745 colonists from Essequibo and the West Indian Islands had settled along the Demerara River and in 1773 Demerara was constituted a separate colony. In 1784 it was reunited under one government with Essequibo while Berbice continued under a separate government, and this arrangement survived under the British Administration until 1831.

The new constitution, based on the recommendations of the Constitutional Commission of 1950, will, it is hoped, be brought into effect early in 1953. It is as follows:

Universal adult suffrage at the age of 21. The Legislature will be bi-cameral and will consist of an elective chamber, to be styled the House of Assembly, composed of 24 elected representatives and three ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Financial Secretary and the Attorney-General); and a revisionary chamber, to be styled the State Council, consisting of six members nominated by the Governor, two appointed on the recommendation of the six Ministers, and one appointed by the Governor in his discretion, after consultation with the minority groups and independent members of the House of Assembly. In certain circumstances there will be joint sessions of both Houses to reconsider measures decided to be of major concern to the well-being of the State. The Legislature will have a life of four years, but the Governor should have powers of prorogation and dissolution. The House of Assembly will be presided over by a Speaker appointed by the Governor from outside the Legislature. He will not have a casting vote.

The Executive Council will consist of the Governor as President, the three ex-officio members and seven unofficial members of the Legislature, six of whom should be elected members of the House of Assembly chosen by ballot and the seventh elected by the State Council. These unofficial members will be designated Ministers and will be vested with the charge of Departments of Government on the basis of their individual Ministerial responsibility. The seventh unofficial member will be designated a Minister without Portfolio.

The Governor will retain the usual reserve powers for use at his discretion in the interests of public order, public faith and other essentials of good government, but should be bound customarily to act in accordance with the advice tendered in the Executive Council.

A Public Services Commission will be established to advise upon the governance of the Civil Service.

Finally, certain special provisions specified in the Report of the Commission should be made for the representation and safeguarding of the interests of the Amerindian community.

Land in the Colony falls within three categories—

(i) Freehold (a) alienated by the Dutch prior to 1803 (b) alienated by the Crown;

(ii) Crown land—about 90% of the area of the Colony;

(iii) Colony land, acquired from private owners and the Crown for public purposes.

Crown land may be alienated or leased to any individual with the consent of the Governor; in the case of Colony land with the consent of the
Governor in Council. Absentee lessees must have a legal representative in the Colony. Alienation of Crown land is restricted to leases for periods not exceeding 99 years. The sale of Crown land has been suspended, but in very special circumstances small areas may still be bought.

The main heads of taxation are Customs, excise and licences, income tax, stamp duties, estate duties, acreage tax, duty on transport and mortgages.

Income tax rates range from 6 cents (for the first $1,200 (£250)) to 60 cents on each $ of chargeable income in the case of individuals. Companies, other than Life Insurance companies, pay 45%; Life Insurance companies 15%.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | £1,302,519 | £1,312,177 |
| 1939 | £1,312,156 | £1,356,624 |
| 1946 | £3,359,062 | £3,251,745 |
| 1947 | £4,183,658 | £4,111,867 |
| 1948 | £4,421,777 | £4,384,275 |
| 1949 | £4,878,688 | £4,651,880 |
| 1950 | £4,740,616 | £5,133,851 |
| 1951 | £5,494,917 | £5,409,788 |

It was estimated that in 1951, 26.52% of revenue came from income tax while Customs produced 42.65%. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: 28.49%
- Administration including Law and Order: 26.26%
- Public Works: 11.78%
- Economic Development: 10.12%

The Public Debt at the end of 1951 was £7,232,956.

The currency in circulation is (1) the new unified currency notes issued by the Currency Board of the British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) brought into circulation on 1st August, 1951, by proclamation; (2) note circulation of the two Joint Stock Banks, Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.) and Royal Bank of Canada, being gradually withdrawn; (3) United Kingdom silver and copper coins and local silver coins (4d.). The currency is exchangeable with sterling at par. The unit of currency is the $ = 4s. 2d. sterling; £ = $4.80.

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945, which succeeded the earlier Act of 1940, the sum allocated to British Guiana by way of financial assistance towards the economic and social development of the Colony was £2,500,000. During 1951 a supplementary allocation of £1,000,000 from Development and Welfare funds was made in favour of the Colony to enable the commencement of drainage and irrigation measures under a long-term comprehensive plan for effective drainage and irrigation of the coastlands and to implement certain proposals in the Evans Commission recommendations which are considered to be deserving of priority. From Colonial Development and Welfare (Central) Reserve Funds an allocation of £60,000 was made for the carrying out of air photography in connexion with the preparation of a new Colony map. In addition a further grant of £6,975 has been received for the provision of aeronautical telecommunications equipment. A number of comprehensive water control schemes covering the entire coastal belt of the Colony are in course of preparation and work has already started in some areas. The execution of large-scale schemes of this kind will be necessary if the Colony is to play its full part in increased agricultural production, particularly of rice, but the cost involved will be beyond the local resources available for development, and outside sources of capital will have to be found for the purpose.

Development is also being undertaken by the Colonial Development Corporation. The Corporation has acquired concessions for the large-scale development of timber in the area known as the Bartica Triangle, and has already completed its preliminary work. The Corporation has also acquired shares in the British Guiana Consolidated Goldfields, Limited, which is engaged in the dredging and mining of alluvial gold, and it has decided to furnish capital on short-term loan for a Rice Development Corporation.

A Mission from the International Bank will arrive in British Guiana early in 1953 to inspect the Colony's resources and to advise on further development.

Nearly 80% of the population is literate. In 1951 there were 279 elementary schools (Government 12, 267 administered through a system of dual control) with 77,907 pupils. Thirty-two Secondary schools cater for about 5,500 students; these include two Government schools—Queen's College for boys and Bishops' High School for girls with a total enrolment of about 1,000 students. The Carnegie Trade School for women provides day and evening courses in the various domestic crafts and the Technical Institute trains industrial apprentices and provides evening classes. The number of students studying in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland at 1st January, 1952, was 189; those studying in the United States of America at 30th June, 1952, was 73. In the academic year 1950–51 the Government spent about £625,000 on education. In 1938 expenditure was £94,290.

The principal diseases are tuberculosis, filariasis and helminthiasis. Preventive measures provided by Government consist of a Sanitary Department with headquarters in Georgetown and branches in each district working under a Public Health Ordinance; Medical Officers of Health for each county; a School Medical Service with a School Medical Officer; a Maternity and Child Welfare League with a Lady Medical Officer of Health; a Mosquito Control Service under a malariologist.

There were in 1951 five general Government Hospitals, 24,777 in-patients and 87,794 out-patients. There are three private general hospitals with a total of 316 beds; 22 cottage hospitals with 2,279 beds; one Tuberculosis Sanatorium with 225 beds; one Leprosy Hospital with 344 in-patients and 777 out-patients, and one Mental Hospital with 507 beds. There were 19 dispensaries, 16 of which deal exclusively with out-patients. In 1951 these handled 40,000 cases.

In 1938 the Government expenditure on Medical Services was £126,025; in 1951 £584,417.

Atkinson Field is the only airport but there are a number of airstrips. Internal services are operated by British Guiana Airways Limited. They are also the agents of the British West Indian Airways Limited who operate services between British Guiana and other parts of the Caribbean; other external services are provided by Pan American Airways and the K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines.
There are two Government-owned railway lines (single track), both parallel to the coast, 80 miles in length. Passengers carried in 1951 totalled 1,799,400 and freight totalled 111,654 tons.

There were in 1952 48 miles of roads with bituminous surface and 479 miles of burnt earth and other roads.

The chief ports are Georgetown, New Amsterdam and Springlands, with a sub-port at Morawhanna. Port Georgetown handled nearly 2 million tons of shipping in 1951. British Guiana is in direct communication with the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Canada, U.S.A., the West Indies, Surinam, and French Guiana. Services are provided for passengers and cargo principally by Booker Lines, Harrison Lines, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Alcoa, Saguenay Terminals.

The three main rivers, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, are navigable by ocean-going vessels of moderate draught for 60, 35, and 100 miles respectively. There are also numerous other rivers which are navigable in their tidal reaches by smaller vessels. There are very many long stretches of water in the upper rivers navigable by launches. Ferry services, coastal and river services are also operated by steamers.

The commercial broadcasting station, Radio Demerara, operates on short and medium waves with a power of 500 kw. There were 12,125 licensed holders of radio receiving sets in 1952.

The greater part of the population is engaged in agriculture. Estimates of workers in other occupations in 1951 are as follows: sugar planting industry 26,200; sugar milling 6,200; bauxite industry 3,200; mixed farming 700; rice farming 1,700; other farming 2,900; timber extraction 3,200; saw-milling 1,300; rice milling 900; other food and drink 1,100; transport and communications 1,400; trade and finance 5,700; services 19,300. In 1951 there were 47 registered trade unions.

The main crops and products are sugar, rum, molasses, rice, coconuts, bauxite, timber, gold and diamonds. The 1951 production figures were: sugar 217,306 tons; rum (exports) 2,040,075 gallons; molasses (exports) 5,512,302 gallons; rice 65,000 tons (estimated); coconuts more than 53 million nuts.

Timber production was principally in greenheart, mora, and crabwood and in 1951 was more than 3½ million cubic feet.

The livestock population in 1950 was: goats 13,930; sheep 37,230; cattle 165,750; pigs 28,020; horses 2,527; mules 1,703; donkeys 6,267; poultry 447,560.

In 1951 bauxite exports totalled 2,002,744 long tons; gold production was 14,689 bullion ounces and diamond production 43,260 metric carats. Exploration for manganese, tantalite, and columbite was proceeding in 1951.

An independent Marketing Board is responsible for the sale of rice. This Board financed the purchase by rice farmers of tractors, combines, ploughs, etc. A hire service of mechanical equipment to farmers was operated by Government mills and land settlement authorities.

Investigations into mechanized cultivation and the agronomic problems involved were carried out on the Mahaicony-Abary Rice Development Scheme.

At 31st December, 1951, there were 181 primary co-operative societies with 6,046 members and savings of $83,170 (£17,327), and special savings and deposits of $10,148 (£2,114).
