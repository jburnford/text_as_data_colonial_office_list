SINGAPORE AND DEPENDENCIES

The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islands, is 224·5 square miles.

The area of Christmas Island is 64 square miles and of the Cocos-Keeling Islands, a group of 27 small coral islands, 5 square miles.

The estimated population at 1st July, 1951, was:

| Singapore |
|-----------|
| Chinese   | 806,690 |
| Malays    | 127,063 |
| Indians   | 75,601  |
| Europeans | 12,785  |
| Eurasians | 10,451  |
| Others    | 9,343   |
| Total     | 1,041,933 |

The population of Singapore City is about 732,000.

The population of the Cocos-Keeling Islands, which numbered 1,217 in July 1951, has since been reduced by emigration to about 400.

The highest point on Singapore Island is 581 feet above sea level. The largest permanent stream is the Sungei Seletar which is nine miles long. Forest and Nature Reserves, including mangrove swamps, total about 15 square miles.

The greater part of Christmas Island is a central plateau 600-700 feet above sea level, rising to low hills up to 1,170 feet. Most of the island is densely wooded: it contains extensive deposits of mixed phosphates. The island lies about 190 nautical miles south of the western extremity of Java.

The Cocos-Keeling Islands are a low-lying coral atoll, thickly covered with coconut palms; the highest point above sea level is 25 feet. The islands lie about 700 nautical miles south-west of Java.

There are no well-defined dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The mean maximum temperature is $87^\circ$, the mean minimum $74^\circ$; average annual rainfall is 95 inches.

A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme, and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits: it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the Imperial Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was recovered on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, and was constituted a separate Colony.

Despite the despoliation it suffered during the occupation, and the post-war unrest which culminated in 1948 in the Malayan Emergency, Singapore entered a new phase of prosperity which was accentuated by the increased world demand for rubber. In 1951 imports were valued at $3,625,000,000 and exports at $4,095,000,000.

The Malayan Emergency has had its inevitable effect on Singapore, particularly in 1950 when there were many terrorist outrages. In December 1950 occurred the tragic riots arising from the "Bertha Hertogh" case, in which 18 people were killed. Public security was greatly improved during 1951, but must remain a constant concern of the Government so long as the Emergency lasts.

The Colony of Singapore is constituted by the Singapore Colony Orders in Council 1946–50. These together with the Royal Instructions of 27th March, 1946, as amended from time to time, provide for:

(a) a Governor and Commander-in-Chief appointed by Commission under Her Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet.

(b) an Executive Council, consisting of the Governor as Chairman; four ex-officio members (namely, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, and the President, City Council); two nominated official members; four nominated unofficial members; two elected members elected by the nominated unofficials and elected members of the Legislative Council from among themselves.

(c) a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President; four ex-officio members (as for the Executive Council); five nominated official members; and not more than twelve elected members of whom three are severally elected by the European, Chinese and Indian Chambers of Commerce, and the remainder by popular franchise from single-member Electoral Districts.
From the foundation of the Settlement of Singapore there has never been any restriction on the alienation of land to non-natives. Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant Crown land within the City area is practically exhausted and large areas are in process of acquisition for public purposes, particularly housing.

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the Colony or received in the Colony from outside. Companies are chargeable at 30% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 3% on the first $500 of chargeable income and rising to 30% on incomes exceeding $50,000. Non-resident individuals are chargeable at 20%, but British subjects and British Protected Persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. A double taxation arrangement with the United Kingdom is in force.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony:

| Year    | Revenue       | Expenditure |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 1946 (9 months) | $29,498,716   | $24,352,910 |
| 1947    | $77,967,858   | $51,824,007 |
| 1948    | $81,270,049   | $74,241,605 |
| 1949    | $108,782,253  | $94,257,156 |
| 1950    | $114,016,040  | $97,117,474 |
| 1951    | $166,377,773  | $113,320,317 |

In 1951 38·54% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 42·32% from income and other taxes.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Administration—general 10·15%
- Social Services 23·85%
- Judicial, Police and Prisons 16·16%
- Miscellaneous Services 20·38%

The Public Debt of the Colony of Singapore at the 31st December 1951 amounted to $115 million or approximately $110 per head of the population. The Public Debt comprises:

(a) S.S. 3% Loan, 1962–72 . . . $30
(b) S.S. 3% War Loan, 1952–59 . . . $25
(c) S.S. 3% War Loan, 1953–60 . . . $10
(d) Singapore Rehabilitation Loan, 1962–70 . . . $50

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is exclusively legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
   (a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners;
   (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.

(ii) Silver dollars and half dollars.

(iii) Subsidiary silver, nickel, etc., coin of various denominations below $1.

(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes. The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1951, was $764,109,202 and of coins $44,603,301. The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar.

The Singapore Development Plan envisages a probable expenditure of some £87·75 million over a period of ten years ending in 1960. The Plan under main headings is as follows:

| Schemes already started | Cost (£000) | Percentage of total | Cost (£000) | Percentage of total |
|-------------------------|------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Agriculture             | 957        | 1                   | 95         | 1                   |
| Multipurpose Projects   | 12,694     | 17                  | 2,475      | 16                  |
| Transport and Communications | 6,509     | 9                   | 11,450     | 77                  |
| Fuel and Power          | 15,891     | 22                  | —          | —                   |
| Social Capital          | 36,617     | 51                  | 786        | 6                   |
| Research                | 310        | —                   | —          | —                   |
| Total                   | 72,978     | 100                 | 14,806     | 100                 |

Total expenditure envisaged = £87,784,000.

Schemes already started include provision of a new power station (£15,500,000), the ten-year Education Plan (£14,000,000), a water supply extension scheme (£8,000,000), housing programmes (£6,000,000), Medical Services development (£6,500,000) and a new airport (£6,000,000). Projects in prospect include wharf extension (£10,000,000) and a land reclamation scheme (£2,500,000). The schemes started are due for completion at varying times between 1952 and 1960. They are the concerns of the Singapore Government, the Singapore City Council, the Singapore Improvement Trust and the Singapore Harbour Board, and it is estimated that the cost will be distributed in the following proportions (subject to any changes which increased revenue makes possible):

| Per cent. |
|-----------|
| Local Funds | 20 |
| Colonial Development and Welfare Funds | 2 |
| Loans | 78 |
| Total | 100 |

An Industrial Estate has been started by the Colonial Development Corporation on a 53-acre site. This is subdivided into factory sites, and several factories are near completion. Industrial commodities produced will include textiles and
edible oil. The Corporation also owns the Federal and Colonial Building Society Limited, set up to assist in alleviating the housing shortage. The authorized capital is £50 million (£5,833,333) of which £7,750,000 (£904,167) has been issued. During 1950 and 1951, 833 applications were accepted and advances made of £1,535,295. The Society is pan-Malayan in character, but 80% of the borrowers live in Singapore.

The 567 schools in the Colony provide education for some 150,000 students of whom 62,000 are taught in English and the remainder in the main vernacular languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). 4,500 teachers are employed, about 40% of them being trained. Approximately 7% of the students are in Secondary Classes. The Junior Technical School provides for 170 boys following day courses, and 600 students in evening classes. 750 men and 350 women students are under training in the Teachers' Training College, the majority on part-time courses while working as student probationer teachers in the schools. The University of Malaya has 265 men and 85 women students from Singapore. Fifty-one Government Scholarships are held at the University of Malaya or at Universities and Colleges overseas. Adult Education Classes are expanding and are now attended by 8,000 persons. The Singapore Education Committee advises Government on all aspects of education, and the Education Finance Board scrutinizes and approves the Departmental estimates before their submission to Government. The net cost of Education in 1951 was $15 million compared with $2·15 million in 1947. Both figures are exclusive of capital expenditure on buildings.

The total expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1951 amounted to $12·75 million, compared with $6·3 million in 1947.

The Government Medical Department in its nine hospitals provides 4,500 beds; of these 1,200 are available for treatment of acute illness. For the rural population there are three main static dispensaries and six travelling dispensaries. There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualifications of M.B. and B.S., registrable in the United Kingdom, can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery; also registrable in the United Kingdom), the Diploma of Pharmacy and the Diploma of the Royal Sanitary Institute.

A new Out-patients' Department and a Nurses' Hostel to accommodate 250 nurses at the General Hospital and two infant welfare centres have recently been built. In the field of tuberculosis out-door treatment is provided at a clinic presented by the Rotary Club; domiciliary relief and assistance by the Almoners' Department is rapidly expanding: a hospital of 500 beds forms part of this organization. A B.C.G. campaign was successfully started in 1951. If the average incidence of tuberculosis from 1939-41 is taken as 100, the index, which rose to 170 during the Japanese occupation, fell to 46 in 1951. The problem remains one of the most urgent, however, and plans for more beds and a Chest Unit are in hand. The Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association with its own clinic and treatment centre gives valuable co-operation to the Government and this Association is also greatly extending its accommodation. Hospital out-patient attendances, which were under 100,000 in pre-war years, rose to over 500,000 in 1951; tuberculosis out-patients have increased from a negligible number to 58,970; rural and maternity clinics have increased from 11 to 40 in 1951 and yearly attendances in the same period from 85,000 to 165,000. Homes visited by nurses now total 21,000, and by midwives 42,000; 66% of rural births are dealt with, while the Maternity Hospital deals with nearly 18,000 maternity cases in its 200 beds, or 25% of the total births of the Colony. In-patients in the main acute hospitals total over 40,000 per annum, compared with 26,000 before the war. Leper services are being rapidly modernized.

Health figures for the Colony continue to improve. Although the population is increasing by some 30,000 a year, the number of deaths dropped from 20,425 per million in 1939 to 11,883 per million in 1951. The infantile death rate fell from 130·4 per thousand in 1939 to 75·15 in 1951. With no outbreak of any of the major infectious diseases Singapore remains one of the healthiest city ports in the Far East. A ten-year Medical Plan approved by the Legislative Council aims to provide the most up-to-date services for the whole population by 1960.

Kallang Airport, on the southern side of Singapore Island, is the international civil airport for Malaya. The Air Traffic Control Centre based at Kallang serves all aircraft flying within the Singapore Flight Information Region. Regional and internal (Singapore—Malaya—Sarawak—North Borneo) scheduled services are provided by Malayan Airways Limited with a fleet of 11 Dakota and six Beaver aircraft. Major external international passenger, airmail and cargo services operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways/British Overseas Airways Corporation
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines
- Pan American Airways Incorporated
- Cathay Pacific Airways Limited
- Garuda Indonesian Airways
- Air Ceylon
- Bharat Airways

London—Sydney
Amsterdam—Djakarta
Manila—New York
Bangkok—Hong Kong
Djakarta—Borneo
Colombo—Sydney
Djakarta—Calcutta

The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge. The Railway enters the Colony at the Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour. There are four railway stations in the Island of Singapore.

At the end of 1951, 221·61 miles of bituminous and 8·93 miles of gravelled surface roads were maintained by the Public Works Department.

There is only one port in the Colony, which has several safe anchorages administered by the Master Attendant, the alongside berthing facilities being controlled by the Singapore Harbour Board. 50,131 merchant ships and native craft (net tonnage 35,405,701) entered and cleared during 1951. The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, the U.S.A., and other countries in the Far East, and there is a regular freight and passenger service to South Africa via East African ports, and to South America.
Several coasting lines are engaged in trade to Indonesia and in conveying transit cargo to Thailand, Borneo and Sarawak.

"Radio Malaya", operated by the Governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, broadcasts programmes over three networks in English, Chinese (seven dialects), Malay and Tamil, totalling 176 hours a week, of which schools' programmes take up some thirty hours. The transmitter station at Jurong radiates on short wave with a power of 5 kw. and on medium wave with a power of 10 kw. A commercial company, Rediffusion (Singapore) Limited, operates a rediffusion service to nearly 25,000 subscribers in Singapore. Nearly 34,000 licences have been issued.

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief occupations are: transport and communications (including port and lighterage) 52,000, commerce and finance 83,000, light industries 67,000, agriculture (largely market gardening) 24,000, public administration (central Government, Defence Services and Local Authorities) 58,000. There are 163 registered trade unions, having a membership of 67,652.

The main crops and products are rubber, coconut oil, copra and pineapples.

Livestock number: buffaloes 476, oxen 4,071, goats and sheep 1,358, swine 195,684.

The forests of Singapore are practically non-productive, and the sawmilling and allied industries rely entirely on imports for their raw material.

There is extensive fishing in local waters but the catch is insufficient to meet demands and is supplemented by imports.

Industrial development is not extensive and apart from the important rubber-milling concerns, of which there are 14, is mainly confined to the production of consumer goods. Rubber manufacturers consist of footwear, sheeting, tubing and hose, and rubber compounds. There are six major and a number of minor biscuit manufacturers, two breweries, three pineapple canneries and a footwear factory. Two factories produce commercial gases, chiefly oxygen, acetylene, and nitrous oxide, and during the year production started on plywood and cane products, and the high speed manufacture of metal containers. Production of building bricks continued to increase in 1951.

(See Federation of Malaya for details of pan-Malayan trade.)

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. The Pineapple Joint Industrial Council is concerned with the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruit, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.

Forty-three co-operative societies were registered on 31st December, 1951. They had a membership of 22,930, a working capital of $3,781,132 and reserve funds of $159,307: they include 37 Thrift and Loan, and Thrift, Societies and four Housing Societies.
