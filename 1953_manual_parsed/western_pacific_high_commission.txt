WESTERN PACIFIC HIGH COMMISSION
(Administrative headquarters : Honiara, British Solomon Islands.)

The office of High Commissioner for the Western Pacific was created by the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877. The High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not administered by Australia, New Zealand, Fiji or any other civilized power. By the Pacific Order in Council of 1893 the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the High Commissioner's jurisdiction also extends to the New Hebrides, and the Banks and Torres
Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate; but a contribution is paid from Imperial Funds in respect of expenses of the British Services in the New Hebrides.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners; and in it is vested all Her Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands. The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner. Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of Her Majesty. A Judicial Commissioner's Court has powers similar to those of the superior courts of England; and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in common law, equity and bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards. With some few exceptions, an appeal against all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court lies to the Supreme Court of Fiji. In addition to other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons who endanger the peace of the islands.

By Orders in Council of 1952 the High Commissioner's responsibilities in respect of the Kingdom of Tonga and the Island of Pitcairn were transferred to the Governor of Fiji with effect from the 1st April, 1952.

The groups at present under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (including the Phoenix and Northern Line Islands groups).
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Southern Line Islands.

Particulars of these are given below.

The posts of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific and the Governor of Fiji, which for many years had been held conjointly, were separated on the retirement of Sir Brian Freeston in 1952; and arrangements were made to transfer the Headquarters of the Western Pacific from Suva, where they had been since the creation of the post of High Commissioner (except for the period when Sir Arthur Gordon combined the posts of Governor of New Zealand and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific) to Honiara in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The High Commissioner established his headquarters at Honiara on 1st January, 1953, and took over responsibility for the direct administration of the Protectorate from the Acting Resident Commissioner on the same date.

BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE

The Protectorate is enclosed within an area of approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,500 square miles are land.

The estimated population in 1951 was:

| Europeans | 400 |
| Melanesians | 95,000 |
| Polynesians | 3,808 |
| Chinese | 246 |

Total: 99,454

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands situated between the parallels of 5° and 12° 30' S., and the meridians of 155° and 170° E. longitude and includes the islands of Guadalcanal, Malaita, San Cristobal, New Georgia, Ysabel, Choiseul, Mono (or Treasury), Vella Lavella, Ranongga, Gizo, Rendova, Russell, Florida, Rennell, and numerous small islands, including the Lord Howe Group or Ongtong Java, the Santa Cruz Islands, Tikopia, Mitre Islands and the Duff and Reef Groups.

The climate is not regarded as unhealthy. The introduction of modern anti-malarial drugs has considerably reduced the dangers of this disease. The seasons are generally well defined by trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the minimum temperatures are recorded. The highest mean and maximum temperatures and the highest rainfall are, as a rule, recorded in the months in the north-west season from November to April.

| Station | Mean Annual Temperature (°F.) | Rainfall (inches) |

Honiara, the capital, has a native population of 750. Europeans number 200, Chinese 140.

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. In 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz group and the north-west coastline of the island of Malaita. From this time many Europeans visited the group and British ships of war paid periodical visits.

Between 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the proclamation in 1893 of the British protectorate over the southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristobal, the New Georgia group and its dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50. In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz group, including Utupua, Tikopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona were added to the Protectorate. In 1900 the northern islands (Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits south and south-west of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ongtong Java) were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.
In 1942 Japanese troops invaded the islands. Most of the non-native population had been evacuated to Australia but the Resident Commissioner and a number of his officers remained to continue the Administration as far as possible. The Japanese occupied the central Solomons and were driven back by the Allies only after violent air, sea and land battles in 1942 and 1943; they were not completely dislodged from the north-western extremity of the Protectorate until the surrender of Japan. The effect upon the population of contact with the very large numbers of Allied servicemen in occupation of the islands and based there for operations further afield, was great and disruption of native life was inevitable; the effects are still being felt in many ways.

An outstanding feature of the war and the enemy invasion of the territory was the great loyalty of the native people to their British connexion and to the Allied cause generally.

The Protectorate is administered directly by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of Queen’s Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. There is an Advisory Council, consisting of official, non-official and native members.

A Special Lands Commissioner has been appointed to conduct a survey and formulate a revised lands policy for the Protectorate.

Income Tax is levied at the rate of 1s. 3d. increased by .012d. for every £ of chargeable income up to £5,000, and 6s. 3d. on every £ of chargeable income over £5,000. When the chargeable income of any person other than a company exceeds £1,500 a surtax is levied at the rate of 1s. 3d. per £ on incomes between £1,500 and £3,000, 2s. 6d. per £ on income between £3,000 and £5,000 and on a sliding scale rising to 10s. 0d. per £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £30,000. Residential tax of £2 per annum is levied on all non-native adult males. Natives pay tax at rates of 5s., 10s., 12s. and £1 per annum, according to areas in which they reside.

Customs duties represent the chief source of revenue from indirect taxation.

The following is a table of public finance in the Protectorate.

| Year     | Revenue Expenditure |
|----------|---------------------|
|          | £A                  |
| 1938-39  | 61,059              |
| 1939-40  | 58,902              |
| 1946-47  | 348,961             |
| 1947-48  | 509,505             |
| 1948-49  | 482,572             |
| 1949 (9 months) | 399,739         |
| 1950     | 439,563             |
| 1951     | 529,208*            |

*Estimate.

The above figures include Colonial Development and Welfare grants and loans from Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom.

It is estimated that in 1951, 63·4% of revenue was derived from Customs duty, and 6·06% from direct taxation. In the same year, the main heads of ordinary expenditure were:

- Medical Department: 20·09%
- Marine Transport: 12·46%
- Police and Prisons: 11·93%

There is no Public Debt in the Protectorate.

The currency is Australian. This is interchangeable with sterling at £Stg.1 = £A.1 5s.

The most important development schemes during 1952 were:

- Guadalcanal Demonstration Farm, estimated cost during 1952: £9,269
- Experimental School, Auki, estimated cost during 1952: £4,525
- Geological Survey, estimated cost during 1952: £5,441
- District Hospitals, estimated cost during 1952: £5,300

During 1952 a Mass Education Survey was commenced. Two projects are well under way and it is hoped that these schemes will be expanded in due course. A Co-operatives Survey Scheme was approved during 1952, and a Co-operative Officer is being trained in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. A scheme to establish cocoa planting was also inaugurated during 1951.

Education is still largely in the hands of the Missions. With the promulgation of the new Education Regulation, Government subsidies will be paid to Missions complying with certain qualifications; the estimated subsidy to Mission schools in 1952 is £6,000. In 1952 there were four Government Primary schools and one Secondary boarding school, all on the island of Malaita. Further development of Government schools is planned. Estimated expenditure for the Education Department in 1952 was £22,720.

The estimated expenditure of the Medical Department during 1952 was £74,512 (including expenditure on the Tetere Leper Settlement, Guadalcanal), compared with £7,557 in 1936-37. There are Government hospitals at Honiara (92 beds), Auki (50 beds) and Gizo (40 beds). That at Honiara is to be rebuilt as soon as possible.

During 1952 a Tuberculosis Survey, a Leprosy Survey and a Nutrition Survey were conducted by the South Pacific Health Commission.

The airfields used by commercial aircraft are at Honiara, Guadalcanal, at Renard Airstrip in the Russell Islands and Barakoma Airfield on the island of Vella Lavella. Qantas Empire Airways operate a weekly service via Port Moresby and Lae from Sydney.

There are about 20 miles of pressed coral surface road extending east and west of Honiara.

Messrs. Burns Philp and Company Limited operate a shipping service to the Protectorate from Sydney. Bank Line vessels under charter to the British Ministry of Food call irregularly to load copra. The chief ports in the Protectorate are Honiara, Tulagi, Yandina and Gizo. During 1951, 98,684 net tons of shipping were entered, and 90,338 net tons cleared. The Protectorate Government owns and operates 12 small vessels for inter-island communications and administrative and medical touring. The Government Trade Scheme owns two vessels, and there is an ever-increasing number of privately owned vessels in the Protectorate.

A daily broadcasting service from the Government Radio Station, VQO Honiara, was inaugurated in 1952 on a wavelength of 1,030 kilocycles. There are 141 licence holders in the Protectorate.

Most of the indigenous population is engaged in agriculture, either in village gardens or in the copra industry. They are under no economic necessity to work for wages. In December 1951 the total number employed was estimated at 4,716, 2,366 of whom were copra workers.
The main crops and products are coconuts, yams, sweet potatoes, taro, nali nut, tapioca, bananas, pineapples and copra. At the end of 1950 the livestock population was estimated at 10,000 pigs, 3,500 cattle, 300 goats, 75 horses.

The chief export is copra which, except for 4,200 tons exported annually to Australia, is shipped to the United Kingdom. Total exports in 1951 were 13,916 tons, valued at £A.934,931.

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| £A.     | £A.     |
| 1938–39 | 185,050 | 151,325 |
| 1939–40 | 192,507 | 186,305 |
| 1948    | 404,703 | 197,395 |
| 1949    | 526,488 | 705,596 |
| 1950    | 618,882 | 857,980 |
| 1951    | 1,000,840| 1,145,636|

(Including bullion and specie.)

Imports are mainly foodstuffs and trade goods from Australia.

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate Copra Board, which has agents at the main ports, purchases all copra from producers and sells under contract to the Ministry of Food. It is anticipated that some native co-operatives will be formed in 1953.

GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY

The area is approximately 369 square miles, comprising 37 islands spread over more than 2,000,000 square miles of water.

The population was 36,000 at the 1947 census: Gilberts 27,824; Ellice 4,487; Phoenix 984; Northern Line 469; Ocean 2,060. By races the population comprises: Micronesians 29,923; Polynesians 5,066; others, including Europeans, 1,011.

With the exception of Ocean Island (which is an atoll raised by volcanic action some 200 feet above its original level) the islands are all coral atolls, some with lagoons and some without. There are 16 atolls in the Gilbert Group, nine in the Ellice, eight in the Phoenix and three in the Northern Line Islands.

The driest months are August to October and the wettest December to February, when northeasterly and westerly storms occur. The southern Gilberts, Phoenix and Christmas Island (Line) suffer from periodic droughts which have an approximate cycle of seven years. Rainfall varies from 100 inches annually in the northern Gilberts through 40 inches in the southern up to 120 inches in the Ellice Islands. In the Phoenix Islands the average rainfall is about 50 inches and in the Line from 30 inches on Christmas Island up to 150 on Washington. The day temperature varies between 80° and 90° throughout the year and the minimum night temperature is about 70°. The trade winds keep the air cool and humidity is not high, except during the rainy season.

The principal islands and their populations at the 1947 census are:

- Ocean Island—District Headquarters 2,060
- Tarawa—Colony and District Headquarters, Gilbert Islands 3,582
- Funafuti—District Headquarters, Ellice Islands 528
- Canton Island—District Headquarters, Phoenix Islands 81
- Fanning Island—District Headquarters, Line Islands 259

The Gilbert and Ellice groups were brought under the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in 1877 and a Protectorate was established in 1892 when H.M.S. Royalist visited them. Ocean Island was annexed in 1900, and in 1916 the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate together with Ocean and the Northern Line Islands became a Colony. In 1937 jurisdiction was extended to the Phoenix Islands.

Local governments are established on islands with indigenous populations in the Gilbert, Ellice and Phoenix groups. They are supervised by District Officers responsible through the Resident Commissioner to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. These governments, under a constitution introduced in 1941, consist of a representative Council with an official majority which exercises minor legislative and executive authority; a Court with criminal and civil jurisdiction over persons of pure and mixed Pacific Islands extraction; and a Lands Court which operates customary law under the supervision of a Lands Commission. Because of the scattered nature of the territory, the local governments have considerable freedom from direct supervision. Non-native residents of the Colony are subject to Colony and English law enforceable in the High Commissioner's Court established under the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

The alienation of land to non-natives is forbidden and leases may not be taken out without the consent of the Resident Commissioner or, if the lease is to be for a period in excess of 99 years or for an area exceeding five acres, without the approval of the High Commissioner. Very little land is owned by non-natives (acquired before annexation) or by the Crown.

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and landowners tax. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for a basic tax of 1s. 3d. in the £ plus as many times ·012d. as there are £'s of taxable income until, at £5,000, the maximum rate of 6s. 3d. in the £ is reached. The statutory exemption is £200; allowances are made for wife, children, etc. Surtax is payable on income over £1,500, starting at 1s. 3d. in the £. Insurance companies pay 9d. in the £ on chargeable income; shipping companies 4½d.; other companies 7½d.

Landowners tax is paid by all landowners and is based upon land productivity and size.

* Canton Island is under joint Anglo-American administration and is an international airport.
† Fanning Island has a relay station on the trans-Pacific cable operated by Cable and Wireless Limited.
Import duties and export (copra) duties are the other main forms of taxation.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony.

| Year       | Revenue (£A) | Expenditure (£A) |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1935–36    | 58,697       | 60,745           |
| 1939–40    | 67,845       | 79,544           |
| 1945–46    | 33,225(a)    | 226,561          |

| 1952 (revised estimate) | 321,476(a) | 277,725(b)       |

(a) Ordinary revenue.

(b) Excluding expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

It is estimated that in 1951 37·5% of revenue was derived from import and export duties and 15·34% from direct taxation. In the same year the (estimated) main heads of expenditure were:

- Marine Transport (12·32%)
- Medical (11·86%)
- Works (6·80%)
- Administration (6·63%)

Australian currency is used in the Colony. Exchange rates fixed in 1949 are:

- £1 Sterling = £A.1 5s. 0d.
- £1 New Zealand = £A.1 5s. 0d.
- £1 Fiji = £A.1 2s. 7d.

The estimated expenditure for 1952 under Colonial Development and Welfare grants is £93,042. Of this total £45,250 has been approved for school construction; £25,000 has been provisionally estimated for the re-construction of the Central Hospital; £9,201 for the erection of navigational aids; £6,562 for land settlement and £2,019 for co-operative society development.

At 31st December, 1951, there were 8,050 children between the ages of 7 and 16 receiving primary education. Ninety-four pupils were at teacher-training centres. Four Primary schools are maintained from Colonial and Local Government funds and 241 are grant-aided. Eighteen students were taking various post-primary and professional courses in Fiji and New Zealand during 1952, funds being provided by a Colonial Development and Welfare grant. Government expenditure on Education in 1950 was £7,468 compared with £3,849 in 1935–36.

Total expenditure on health services, excluding building and maintenance and overseas training, during 1950 was £32,112 compared with £8,848 in 1935–36. Each island has its hospital supervised by a resident Dresser; Government Medical Officers and Assistant Medical Practitioners tour regularly. In-patients admitted to Government hospitals during 1950 totalled 4,108 and outpatient attendance was 119,815. Yaws is widespread and tuberculosis, influenza and dysentery occur on most islands.

There is an international airport at Canton Island; scheduled landings averaged over 60 a month during 1951. The emergency landing-strip at Tarawa is used irregularly; flying-boats occasionally visit Tarawa and can land at several other lagoon islands.

Communications in the Colony are mainly marine; the Colony Government operates three small inter-island vessels; the Colony Wholesale Society, two; the Missions, three. Communications overseas are normally by these vessels to Ocean Island; each month several vessels owned or chartered by the British Phosphate Commissioners arrive at Ocean Island from, or leave for, Australia or New Zealand. At irregular intervals one of the inter-island vessels visits Fiji and two or three times a year a ship arrives from Fiji en route for the United Kingdom to load copra at Tarawa and in the Line Islands.

The Government operates 24 radio transmitting and receiving stations to pass messages within the Colony, to ships and to Fiji.

Most of the population is engaged in copra production. Estimated numbers in other occupations (1951) are: Government service 1,100 including 550 part-time Native (local) Government officials; phosphate mining 1,200; commerce 500.

Apart from copra production there is no other crop of commercial value. Sea fishing is excellent but on a small scale. Phosphate of lime is mined at Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners.

In 1939, 42% of total imports came from Australia or New Zealand, 35% from other Commonwealth countries, and 23% from elsewhere. In 1951 the corresponding percentages were 71%, 24% and 5%.

In 1939 62% of total exports went to Australia or New Zealand, 17% to other Commonwealth countries, and 21% elsewhere. In 1951 the corresponding percentages were 47%, 52% and 1%.

The principal imports are cotton goods, fuel oils, soap, tobacco and foodstuffs (rice, flour, sugar and tinned meat).

Twenty-six multipurpose co-operative societies (registered membership 12,575 in 1950) handle all copra purchasing from, and the retailing of trade...
goods to all inhabitants on their islands. All societies are members of the Colony Wholesale Society. The volume of private trading is very small.

THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONDOMINIUM OF THE NEW HEBRIDES

The area, including the Banks and Torres Islands, is estimated at 5,700 square miles.

The native population is composed of approximately 45,000 Melanesians, with an admixture of Polynesian blood in certain parts of the group. The non-native population in December 1951 included approximately 340 British nationals, 12,000 French nationals and 1,900 Asiatic labourers. The latter are mainly Indo-Chinese and their families, introduced as indentured labour up to 1940, and now awaiting repatriation.

The islands are of coral and volcanic formation, with active volcanoes on Tanna, Lopevi and Ambrym. They are almost without exception mountainous, Santo Peak and Tabwebesana on Santo rising to over 6,000 feet, but narrow, cultivable coastal strips are generally present.

The rather enervating climate is generally classed as unhealthy owing to the prevalence of malaria, but conditions of living, particularly in the town of Vila, have improved greatly in recent years. The year is divided into two fairly distinct seasons, the hot and wet season, during which cyclones may occur, from November to April, and the dry and cool season of the south-east trade winds from May to October. Temperatures at Vila vary between 56° and 94°, and average rainfall ranges from about 45 inches in the south to about 250 inches in the north with a mean figure of 74 inches for Vila.

The only town in the group is Vila, the Administrative Headquarters, with a population of 1,200.

The New Hebrides were discovered by the Spanish explorer, de Quirós in 1605. The next mention came from the French navigator Bougainville in 1768, and in 1774 Captain Cook visited and charted the greater part of the chain of islands comprising the group. Other early visitors were Lapérouse, who is believed to have passed through in 1788, and D'Entrecasteaux who came in search of Lapérouse in 1793. In this same year the sighting of the Banks Islands was recorded by Captain Bligh in the course of his open boat voyage to Timor after the mutiny on the Bounty. Last century, before any national eyes were turned on the New Hebrides, a number of British and French missionaries, planters and traders had established themselves, and in 1887, by the Anglo-French Convention of 16th November, the two nations appointed a Joint Naval Commission charged with the protection in the New Hebrides of the lives and properties of the subjects of England and France.

The New Hebrides became an important allied base during the Second World War and the islands of Efate and Santo were occupied by large garrisons, mainly of United States troops, in the early stages of the offensive against the Japanese.

In 1902 Deputy Resident Commissioners were appointed and took up residence in the Territory, and in February 1906 an Anglo-French conference took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for settlement of land claims and for an arrangement to end the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. This was confirmed on 20th October, 1906.

As the New Hebrides is not a territorial possession of either power concerned, there are no Crown lands or their equivalent. The whole of the land area of the group is held to belong, or to have belonged until alienated, to the natives. The Protocol regulates the acquisition of unregistered land from natives, and the registration of land claims. It provides for the creation of inalienable native reserves, and for the control of sales of land by natives to non-natives.

The main forms of taxation are import duties (15% ad valorem, with certain exceptions) and duties of from 2% to 4% on exports of copra, cocoa, coffee, shell, etc. There is no income tax.

Condominium revenue and expenditure is shown in the following table:

English sterling and Australian and French currencies are legal tender in the New Hebrides.

The French Government has established a free Primary school at Vila and the Roman Catholic Mission has schools at Vila and Santo. The British Government gives a small subsidy for a Primary school for British children and a Presbyterian Mission School for natives at Vila. Village schools are conducted by Mission bodies in the vicinity of their stations throughout the group.

French Government hospitals and medical aid posts are established at Vila, Santo and Malekula and staffed by French National Medical Officers. Supported and subsidized by Her Majesty's Government, hospitals and medical aid posts have been established in some outlying islands. British and French National Medical Officers comprise a Condominium medical service providing quarantine control, medical inspection of plantation and other labour and medical assistance to the native population. This joint service is reinforced by New Hebrides Assistant Medical Practitioners trained at the central Medical School in Suva, some belonging to the Condominium and some to the British National Service. Simple medical works for natives are carried out by missionaries.

The only airfields are at Vila and Santo. Flying-boat landing facilities exist at both these places, and a weekly British flying-boat service operates through New Caledonia and Australia.
There are limited roads on Efate, Santo, Tanna and Malekula.

Shipping services are maintained with Australia, New Caledonia and Marseilles via Panama Canal and San Francisco. There is frequent inter-island communication (non-scheduled) by small vessels.

Telegraphic communication is by direct wireless contact with Suva, Noumea and Sydney, and there is an internal network of teleradio stations. There is no Government or commercial broadcasting station.

Most of the population is employed on plantations and in trading or subsistence agriculture. There are no trade unions.

The main crops and products are copra, cocoa, coffee, yams, taro, manioc, and breadfruit.

**THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN LINE ISLANDS**

These consist of Flint, Caroline, Vostock, Malden and Starbuck, and are administered direct by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, formerly under Article 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, and more recently in accordance with instructions issued by the Secretary of State in 1903, under Article 4 of the Order in Council.

Flint Island was discovered in 1801 but continued search has failed to elicit the name or nationality of the discoverer. Since 1872 it has been worked for guano and copra, with interruptions, by various British companies under licence issued by the High Commissioner. In 1951 it was leased to Mr. T. A. Bambridge of Tahiti.

Caroline Island was discovered in 1705 by Captain W. R. Broughton of H.M. Sloop Providence, and it has been worked by various British companies since 1846. It is now leased, with Flint, to Mr. T. A. Bambridge.

Vostock Island was discovered by Captain Bellingshausen, the Russian explorer, during his expedition to the South Pacific and Antarctic in 1820, and has been worked sporadically by British companies for guano and copra since 1873. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Malden Island was discovered by Lord Byron, Captain of H.M.S. Blonde, in 1825, after conveying the remains of the King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands back to Honolulu from England for burial. Its guano deposits were worked by an Australian company from approximately 1860 to 1927. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Starbuck Island was discovered in 1823 by Captain Starbuck, of the whaler L’Aigle owned by a London company. It was first worked for guano by a British company during the eighties. Attempts to plant coconuts on the island failed and since 1920 it has been unoccupied and unworked.
