**ZANZIBAR**

Zanzibar Island is 640 square miles in area, and Pemba 380 square miles.

The population was 264,162 at the 1948 census. (Zanzibar Island 149,575 and Pemba 114,587.) The racial composition is as follows:— Europeans 296; Arabs 44,560; Indians (including Pakistanis and Goans) 15,892; Africans 199,975; others 3,439.

The island of Zanzibar is the largest coralline island on the East African coast and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. To the north-east at a distance of some 25 miles lies the island of Pemba. Both islands are low-lying, the highest land being little over 390 feet.

The mean maximum temperature is 84·4° and the mean minimum 76·6° (Zanzibar Town). The warmest season is from January to March (average 82° to 86°) and the coolest, June to September (average 75° to 78°).

The average annual rainfall in Pemba varies from 65 inches in the north to 95 inches in the south, in Zanzibar from 48 inches to over 80 inches, the maximum being recorded in the centre of the Island. There is no real dry season but the rainy seasons are well marked, being March to May in the south-west monsoon and in November and December at the start of the north-east monsoon.

The principal towns are:—

In 1698 the Arabs of Oman captured Mombasa, where the Portuguese had built a fort in 1592. Thereafter the whole of the East African coast as far south as Cape Delgado, including Zanzibar and Pemba, passed from Portuguese into Arab hands. Seyyid Said bin Sultan, the founder of modern Zanzibar and of its clove industry, was elected to the Imamate in 1804 and transferred his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar in 1832, and during his reign Zanzibar became both politically and commercially the principal town in East Africa. In 1861, by an award of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India, the Imam's possessions in Africa became independent of Muscat and from that date Oman and Zanzibar have remained politically separate.

By an agreement in 1886 Great Britain and Germany recognized the Sultanate of Zanzibar over the islands of the coast (including Zanzibar and Pemba) and a ten-mile wide strip on the mainland.

In 1887 the Sultan handed over the administration of many of his possessions on the African Continent to the British East Africa Association (later, the Imperial British East Africa Company). The Government of these territories eventually passed to the British Government when they became known as the British East Africa Protectorate (later, Kenya Colony and Protectorate) and the Uganda Protectorate. Zanzibar still receives the sum of £10,000 a year from Kenya as rent for these possessions.
In June 1889 Zanzibar and Pemba were placed under British protection by the Sultan, Seyyid Ali bin Said. The Protectorate was proclaimed in 1890 and the following year a regular form of Government was set up.

The present Sultan acceded in 1911. In 1914 the control of the Sultanate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, the offices of His Majesty's Agent and Consul-General and His Highness' First Minister being merged in that of the newly created post of British Resident who was appointed subject to the control of the Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate as High Commissioner. At the same date a Protectorate Council was constituted as an advisory body with His Highness as President and the British Resident as Vice-President.

In 1925 the office of High Commissioner was abolished and the British Resident was made directly responsible to the Colonial Office. Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted in 1926 in place of the old advisory Protectorate Council.

The Government is administered by a British Resident who exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1924. The Executive Council is presided over by the Sultan with the British Resident as Vice-President and consists of the Heir Apparent to the Throne, four ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Senior Commissioner and the Financial Secretary) and three official members. The Legislative Council is presided over by the British Resident and comprises four ex-officio, five official, and eight unofficial members. The unofficial members are nominated by the Sultan by and with the advice of the British Resident and include three Arabs, two Africans, two Indians and one European.

Under the Land Alienation Decree of 1939, subject to certain provisos, permanent alienation of land leases exceeding two years, and mortgages, by Arabs or Africans have no effect without the consent of a Land Alienation Board. In certain of the more undeveloped areas of the island, mainly inhabited by the indigenous Africans, the land is communally held and, according to native custom, cannot be alienated. But throughout the plantation areas (west and centre of both islands) land is freehold and there is no other statutory qualification as to its disposal. A good deal of land is, however, recovered under the system of quasi-religious dedication of Muslim law, known as Wakf.

The principal sources of taxation are Customs import duty, clove duty and income tax. There is no poll or hut tax.

The Income Tax Decree provides for taxation on incomes of over £200 but exempts income from agricultural sources. The rate of taxation is Shs. 1/50 in the £.

The following is a table of public finance in the Territory.

| 1951* | 1,564,729 | 1,177,753 |

* Excludes Development Plan budget.

Public Debt: A loan of £30,000 from the National Bank of India Finance and Development Corporation Limited for the new Zanzibar Electricity Scheme.

The main heads of expenditure in 1951 were: agriculture £102,213, health £156,690, education £163,848, provincial administration £66,919, public works £223,096, and pensions £101,105.

The chief sources of revenue in 1951 were: import duty £639,142, clove duty £371,994, licences, etc. £148,674, and Colonial Development and Welfare grants £145,451.

The standard coin of the Protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Shs. 20 = £1) with the following subsidiary coinage: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent (bronze). East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon. The amount in circulation at 31st December, 1951, was £283,400 notes and £295,338 coin.

Zanzibar received an allocation of £890,726 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development Plan. In 1951 the Plan was revised and it is now proposed to spend about £492,260 between 1951 and 1956. In addition revenue is to be found from the following sources:

- Zanzibar Revenue: £10,503
- Customs Development Duty: £554,580

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- Basic Services: £625,619 (45%)
- Social Services: £561,896 (40%)
- Productive Services: £268,294 (15%)

The following schools for Arabs, Africans and Indians are maintained by Government:

| Number of Schools | Number of Pupils |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Boys Girls        | Boys Girls       |
| Primary           | 35 6             | 5,195 1,039 |
| Rural Middle      | 1 —              | 140 —      |
| Secondary (Senior)| 1 1             | 219 69     |
| Secondary (Junior)| 2 1             | 251 56     |

In addition there is an enrolment of 974 boys and 1,410 girls at 12 grant-aided schools which cater mainly for Indians. Primary education in Government Schools is free for Arabs and Africans. Teachers for the Primary Schools are trained at the two teacher-training institutions, one for men and one for women, while post-secondary education for Arab and African students is provided at Makerere College, Uganda. Scholarships are provided for selected scholars to proceed to the United Kingdom and to India.

Schools are also run by various Christian Missions. European children usually attend schools on the mainland. They receive financial assistance from the Government, but have to pay a special education tax. Expenditure on education in 1951 was estimated at £163,848, compared with £27,220 in 1935.

There is one combined Government Hospital for Europeans, Africans and Asiatics in Zanzibar, and two in Pemba; there are two maternity hospitals in Zanzibar. A new hospital with about 250 beds to replace the existing out-of-date building is being constructed. Dispensary units are maintained in the rural districts, and there is one Isolation Hospital where cases of contagious and infectious diseases are treated. A tuberculosis...
sanatorium of about 40 beds has been established on high ground 13 miles from Zanzibar town. Anti-malarial measures are maintained in and around the town.

The total expenditure of the Health Department in 1951 was £110,574 compared with £35,577 in 1935.

Zanzibar airport is situated five miles from the town. It has one all-weather runway. Operations are restricted to aircraft with a maximum all-up weight of 44,000 lb. This figure is ample for the types of aircraft in use at present, but the construction of the runway and the adjacent terrain is such that extensions could easily be made and this figure considerably increased. A new airport building came into use on 1st January, 1952. Air Traffic Control and other services are provided. The airport is open throughout the daylight hours. The total number of aircraft movements during 1950 was over 5,000. The number of passengers handled was over 22,000 of which more than 3,000 were in transit.

Zanzibar has 200 miles of roads, of which 150 miles are bitumen surfaced; Pemba has 100 miles, of which 50 are bitumen surfaced. There are no railways.

Ocean-going vessels maintain regular and frequent communication with all parts of the world; 250 called at the port of Zanzibar during 1951, representing a total net registered tonnage of 1,217,933. Government steamers maintain regular weekly connexions with Pemba and Dar es Salaam. Coasting vessels, carrying both passengers and cargo, also maintain regular services between Zanzibar, Kenya and Tanganyika ports. During 1951 the number of coasting vessels entered was 450 with a net registered tonnage of 157,526; the number of native vessels entered was 3,290, with an aggregate tonnage of 113,035.

The Government broadcasting service provides an hour's programme in Kiswahili six days a week. It is estimated that there are 1,000 receiving sets, most of them in Zanzibar Town. There is no licence fee.

A large proportion of the rural population is engaged in food production; paid labour is largely dependent on the Protectorate's two major industries, cloves and coconuts, and the processing and handling of their products. Agricultural labourers employed by Government number about 1,200. Fishing is also the occupation of a large number but they usually cultivate as well.

In urban areas, the principal occupations are transport, domestic service, employment in sanitation and public works, clerical work, and business.

There are four employees' trade unions (membership 556) and one employers' union (membership 11).

The main crops are cloves, coconuts, rice, cassava, sweet potatoes, citrus fruits, chillies, tobacco, maize and millet.

The number of cattle in Pemba is approximately 23,307 and in Zanzibar 9,606. The export of hides and skins is a useful item in the Protectorate's economy.

There are three forests, one in Zanzibar and two in Pemba which yield a small amount of Mfuu (Vitex cuneata) and Mtondoo (Calophyllum inophyllum), while jackwood (Artocarpus integra) is a useful timber of the clove areas.

Fishing is an important activity; the fish is consumed locally. There is a small export of dried shark. Experimental fish-ponds, of both salt and fresh water, have not proved successful during the past two years. A fisheries vessel is under construction and will shortly be in use seeking means of increasing fish production.

The only industries are the distillation of clove-oil, coconut-oil expression and the manufacture of soap. The manufacture of coir fibre and rope by hand is fairly extensive in the coastal areas, but most of the resulting product is at present sold locally. A factory to process by-products of the coconut palm is expected to start operating shortly.

| 1951 | 5,139,089        | 765,430    | 5,296,129|

(These figures exclude bullion, specie, and transit trade.)

In 1938 14·66% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 39·53% from other Commonwealth countries and 45·81% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1951 were United Kingdom 20·93, Commonwealth countries 29·27, foreign 49·80.

In 1938 4·74% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 31·83% to other Commonwealth countries and 63·43% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1951 were United Kingdom 10·28, Commonwealth countries 75·14, foreign 14·58.

The Clove Growers' Association, established in 1927 and incorporated by Decree in 1934, assists in stabilizing the price of cloves and distils and markets clove oil. The Association also assists in the marketing of other products, for example, coconut oil, as agent of the Ministry of Food. It also provides many valuable services to agriculturists.

A Decree relating to the Constitution and Regulation of Co-operative Societies was enacted in 1948, and brought into force in April 1952.

THE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES

(BASUTOLAND, THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE AND SWAZILAND)

The Territories of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland in southern Africa are administered by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations through a High Commissioner appointed by the Queen. The High Commissioner also holds the office of High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in the Union of South Africa. He is the sole legislative authority for these Territories and is responsible to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in much the same way as a Colonial Governor is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Each Territory is administered by a Resident Commissioner, responsible to the High Commissioner, and is divided into administrative districts in charge of District Commissioners.

Information about these Territories will be found in *The Commonwealth Relations Office List*. This brief note, and the following Civil Establishment list showing heads and deputy heads of departments and analogous appointments, have been included in *The Colonial Office List* 1953 because the Territories' Services are interchangeable with the Colonial Service. Biographical notes are included in the Record of Services section.

DEFENCE OF THE COLONIAL TERRITORIES

Colonial Defence. Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are directly responsible for the defence of the Colonial Territories. The two main objects are the security of the Colonies themselves from external attack, and the development of the full resources of the Colonies in the event of war. The security of the Colonies rests mainly upon the maintenance by the Imperial forces of command of the sea and air approaches and of freedom of the lines of communication between the different parts of the Empire. Plans and preparations for Colonial Defence thus fall (apart from any arrangements for Regional Defence which may be made with other Members of the Commonwealth) within the general scope of the defence measures for which the United Kingdom Government are primarily responsible.*

Colonial Forces. The following forces are maintained in the Colonial territories. The chief function is to preserve internal security and local defence, but in exceptional circumstances some of the regular forces serve outside their geographical regions.

Full-time Forces

The Royal West African Frontier Force, raised from Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and the Gambia.
The King's African Rifles, raised from Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Nyasaland.
The Northern Rhodesia Regiment.
The Somaliland Scouts.
The Malay Regiment.
The Federation Regiment (Malaya).
The Jamaica Battalion.
The Aden Protectorate Levies.
The Fiji Military Forces (regular and territorial).
The Royal Malayan Naval Force.
The Royal East African Naval Force.

Part-time Forces

The Royal Hong Kong Defence Force.
The British Honduras Volunteer Guard.
The British Guiana Volunteer Force.
The Barbados Regiment.
The Bermuda Rifles.
The Bermuda Militia Artillery.
The Leeward Islands Defence Force.
The Kenya Regiment.
The Falkland Islands Defence Force.
The Federation of Malaya Volunteer Force.
The Singapore Volunteer Corps.
The Malayan Auxiliary Air Force.
The Mauritius Volunteer Naval Force.
The Malayan R.N.V.R.

Some of these Forces are administered by the Colonial Governments, others by the United Kingdom Service Departments concerned.

In addition the Service Departments maintain certain units in Colonial territories. These include the Royal Malta Artillery, the Gibraltar Defence Force, the Mauritius and Seychelles elements in the Pioneer Corps, "locally enlisted personnel" wherever British forces are stationed, R.A.F. (Malaya), R.A.F. Regiment (Malaya) and R.A.F. (Malta).
