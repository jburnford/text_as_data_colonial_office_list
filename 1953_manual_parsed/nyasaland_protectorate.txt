NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

The area is approximately 48,444 square miles of which approximately 10,000 square miles is water (Lake Nyasa).

The estimated population at the end of 1951 was 2,401,352.

| Europeans | 4,073 |
|---|---|
| Asiatics | 5,248 |
| Africans | 2,392,031 |
The main tribal groups of the Africans are as follows:

| Tribe          | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|
| Chewa (Chipeta) | 28         |
| Yao            | 14         |

| Tonga          | 2          |
| Others         | 1          |

Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa, and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The Lake is 360 miles long and from 20 to 50 miles wide. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north of the Territory.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, surmounted by Mount Mlanje (10,000 feet) in the south and Zomba Mountain (7,000 feet) bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River.

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south much of which is liable to extensive flooding and contains much marshland.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chiwra and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa. There are no large areas of primary forest.

There is a dry season roughly from April to November. Rainfall has been very variable in past years; the following figures are given as an example of temperature and rainfall in selected areas:

The modern history of Nyasaland begins with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa on 16th September, 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies, the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—traders, hunters, and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to “The King and Chiefs of Central Africa.” Shortly afterwards a second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September, 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to “The British Central Africa Protectorate” but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of “The Nyasaland Protectorate.” The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

There was one internal disturbance, the Chilembwe Rising, in the year 1915 when a native pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges. Rapid counter-measures were taken and the rising came to an end.

During the war years 1939–45 the Protectorate was able to aid the war effort both in men and materials. The two regular Battalions of the King’s African Rifles were expanded to twelve, and added Abyssinia, Madagascar and Burma to a list of campaigning grounds which already covered Africa from British Somaliland to Ashanti. In all some 30,000 of all races in Nyasaland served in the Armed Forces during these years.

The present constitution became effective in 1907. There is an Executive Council presided over by the Governor and comprising three ex-officio members, two official members and two unofficial members, a total of seven. The Legislative Council comprises 18 members, three ex-officio members, six other official members, nine unofficial members. Five of the unofficial
members of Legislative Council are selected from nominations by public bodies representing European interests; one is nominated by the Governor; two African members are selected from nominations made by the African Protectorate Council, and one Asian member from nominations made by an Asian public body. There is an African Protectorate Council which advises Government in regard to matters concerning Africans and in each Province there is also an African Provincial Council.

Land policy is controlled by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Order in Council, 1950. African trust land, which represents approximately 95% of the total area of the Protectorate, may at the discretion of the Governor be leased for terms up to 99 years. The Secretary of State's sanction is required to the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land, apart from a small proportion used for public purposes, or falling within certain minor categories defined in the governing Order in Council, is held in freehold in private ownership.

Three forms of direct taxation are in force: non-native poll tax, income tax and surtax, and native tax. A non-native poll tax is payable by all non-native males over 18 years of age who are resident in the Protectorate. The tax is £4 per year, or £2 per half year. Income tax is payable by Companies at a flat rate of 7s. 6d. in the £. Income tax and surtax, where appropriate, are payable by individuals except Africans. Surtax is imposed on chargeable incomes in excess of £1,500. Rates of income tax begin at 1s. 3d. in the £ and reach the maximum rate of 5s. in the £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £1,100. Rates of surtax begin at 1s. 3d. in the £ and reach a maximum rate of 9s. 6d. in the £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £29,500. A native tax varying in amount from year to year is paid by all male Africans over 18 years of age. An automatic increase of a percentage of this tax is levied if the tax has not been paid by the 1st October in any year. The rate in 1952 was 17s. 6d. and the additional penalty was 7s. 6d.

The following is a table of public finance in the Protectorate.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | 842,410 | 810,260     |
| 1939 | 817,485 | 805,637     |
| 1946 | 1,287,081| 1,136,883   |
| 1947 | 1,631,467| 1,375,645   |
| 1948 | 2,048,732| 2,104,893   |
| 1949 | 2,587,664| 2,745,295   |
| 1950 | 3,545,763| 3,598,195   |
| 1951 | 3,793,449| 4,077,297   |
| 1952 (estimate)| 3,964,593| 4,157,187   |

It is estimated that in 1952, 35-34% of revenue will be derived from Customs and excise and 43-09% from direct taxes.

The Public Debt at the end of December 1952 amounted to £4,970,000 composed of the following:

- East Africa Guaranteed Loan 3% 1954/74: £1,570,000
- H.M.G. Interest-free Loan: £1,340,000
- Development Loan 4½% 1971/78: £2,060,000

The currency in circulation is issued by the Southern Rhodesian Currency Board in Salisbury on behalf of the three Central African Territories. It consists of notes of £5, £1, 10s. and 5s.; cupro-nickel coins of 2s. 6d., 2s., 1s., 6d. and ½d.; cupro-nickel and bronze coins of 1d. and ½d.; and is interchangeable with sterling at par. United Kingdom currency is also legal tender.

The Development Programme as revised in 1950 provides for the expenditure of £12 million over the ten-year development period from 1946. Works to the value of £3,275,000 had been carried out up to 1950 and the balance of the programme is to be carried out from 1950 to 1956. The chief categories of expenditure are as follows:

- Economic Development: £3,800,000
- Communications Development: £3,700,000
- Social Services: £2,300,000
- Administrative Services: £2,700,000

The sources of finance are:

- Allocation from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund: £2,700,000
- Development Loan: £3,000,000
- Nyasaland Revenue: £6,300,000

A further allocation of £500,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds was made in 1952 for economic works; a grant of £150,000 has also been made from the same source to meet part of the cost of the Shire Valley Survey Project for exploring the possibilities of controlling the flow of the Shire River, generating hydro-electric power and irrigating large areas of the Lower River. Various research schemes are being financed from the Colonial Development and Welfare Central Funds, the most notable being a scheme for agricultural experimentation conducted near Lilongwe in the Central Province and a scheme for the geological mapping of the Territory. Grants from the same source provide for the expansion of aeronautical-telecommunications, and for meteorological services.

The Colonial Development Corporation is at work on the Vipya Plateau in the Northern Province for the production of tung oil for export; export will be undertaken through the new port of Nkata Bay which is being constructed by Government to develop a route by lake steamer and rail to Beira. Development is concentrated at present on the expansion of export crops, and attention is also being given to forest resources.

In 1951 there were 4,582 African, nine Asian, one Eurafican and five European Primary Schools in the Protectorate, accommodating 240,624 African, 577 Asian, 96 Eurafican and 330 European pupils. There is a Government African Secondary School at Dedza, where technical and commercial studies are being developed. Including enrolment at Blantyre and Zomba Secondary Schools, 170 Africans were pursuing a course of secondary education. European children generally proceed to Southern Rhodesia for post-primary education.

There are 12 assisted Teacher Training Centres, and a Government Jeanes Centre at Domasi. They catered for 206 African teacher trainees during the year. During 1951 four Africans were granted scholarships to Makerere University College, Uganda, eight to Fort Hare, South Africa, and one to the United Kingdom. Thirteen Europeans gained scholarships of which five were tenable in the United Kingdom and the remainder in the Union of South Africa. Two Africans were studying for degrees in India. The Government of India gave a further scholarship to an African tenable in India.

Expenditure on education for the year 1951 was £375,307, including estimated expenditure by voluntary agencies. In 1934 expenditure was some £67,000.
In 1951 the medical facilities, including maternity beds, made available by Government were: 34 beds for Europeans in three hospitals, 1,115 beds for Africans and Asians in 19 hospitals. There were 96 rural health units, which treated 1,056,660 patients of whom 31,212 were admitted to hospital. Mission hospitals provided 623 beds. Estimated Government expenditure on health in 1951 was £259,664, of which £91,000 was defined as expenditure on development. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £40,808.

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and ten out-station airfields to which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Director of Civil Aviation, and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre and Lilongwe. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation, and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways operate a twice-weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

The length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways Limited is 289 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe, Blantyre, to the lake shore at Chipoka. In 1951, 228,671 tons of freight and 285,266 passengers were transported by the railway.

The total road mileage is approximately 5,000, of which only some 100 miles have a bituminous carpet.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways Limited. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

- Monkey Bay–Chipoka–Kota Kota–Likoma Island–Chinteché–Nkata Bay–Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika)–Ruarwe–Florence Bay–Deep Bay–Ngara–Kaporo (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

During 1951, 8,255 tons of freight and 3,629 passengers were transported by the lake service.

There is no broadcasting station or wired rediffusion service in Nyasaland, but there are about 3,000 receivers in the Protectorate with an estimated average of eight listeners per receiver.

Accurate statistics are not available but principal occupations are in the following trades or professions:

**Europeans.** Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, tung production, cotton farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

**Asians.** Wholesale and retail trading.

**Africans.** The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in the following occupations: Government service, transport services, tobacco and cotton cultivation, retail trading.

The main crops are maize, millet, cassava, groundnuts, tea, tobacco, rice, cotton, tung-oil, soya beans.

Timber production includes supplies for a plywood factory.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa but very little organized trade: fishery research is being undertaken.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of plywood, soap, cigarettes, and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

The marketing of the two principal African trust land crops, tobacco and cotton, is handled by two Statutory Boards, whose aim is to ensure a steady remunerative price to the producer, to secure improvement of the quality of the product and to build up reserves. The Boards help to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of an annual contribution from profits to the Native Development and Welfare Fund. The Maize Control Board aims at an equitable distribution to industry of supplies of maize surplus to the subsistence needs of producers. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors.

On the 31st December 1951 there were 79 Co-operative Societies, with 3,097 members and total working capital of £11,815 of which £4,100 consists of loans provided by the Commissioner for Co-operative Development from the Native Development and Welfare Fund of the Protectorate.
