HONG KONG

The land area is 391 square miles (Hong Kong Island 32 square miles, Kowloon 3¼ square miles, New Territories (leased) 359 square miles). British waters comprise a rectangular area of some 710 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory and bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.

The 1951 mid-year estimate of population was 2,030,000, 99% of whom are of Chinese race, many being British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. There are estimated to be some 10,000 citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and of Commonwealth countries, excluding Service personnel and their families; 3,000 British subjects of Portuguese origin; nearly 2,000 other permanent residents, chiefly continental Europeans, Americans and Portuguese born in the Far East; and nearly 3,000 other temporary residents.
The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the north, together with some 75 adjacent islands ranging from Lantau, with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria, the capital, on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.

The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside covered with dense scrub in some parts, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented. A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain, Taimoshan (3,142 feet); Lantau Peak is 3,067 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,806 feet high.

The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° in February to 82° in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° or falls below 49°. The average annual rainfall is 84-76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.

The great bulk of the population lives in Victoria and Kowloon, which are estimated each to contain over 750,000 people. Of the other islands the most thickly populated is Cheung Chau with 22,000 inhabitants.

Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters' Island in the harbour, Aplichau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of nine officials and eight unofficials, five of whom are Chinese. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of five officials and eight unofficials, two of whom are elected.

There is in force an Inland Revenue Ordinance imposing a tax on earnings and profits at the standard rate in 1952–53 of 12½%. On salaries and annuities, and on the total personal incomes of individuals, a personal allowance of $7,000 tax free income is made, also allowances for wives and families. Tax is then charged in increasing proportions of the standard rate, commencing at 1/5th on the first $5,000 taxable income. Corporation profits are charged entirely at the standard rate.

Other sources of revenue are rates, stamp and estate duties, entertainment, betting and business registration fees. Excise duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor, toilet preparations and table waters.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony.

| Year       | Revenue     | Expenditure |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1939       | $41,478,052 | $37,949,116 |
| 1940–41 (15 months) | $70,175,115 | $64,787,557 |
| 1946–47 (11 months) | $82,141,556 | $85,624,391 |
| 1947–48    | $164,298,310 | $127,701,174 |
| 1948–49    | $194,933,955 | $159,954,023 |
| 1949–50    | $264,250,543 | $182,121,726 |
| 1950–51    | $291,728,416 | $251,684,521 |
| 1951–52    | $308,564,247 | $275,885,951 |
| 1952–53 (estimated) | $290,762,200 | $288,673,012 |

It is estimated that in 1952–53 $99,700,000 will be raised from direct and indirect taxes, $69,000,000 from Duties and $32,070,000 from Rates.

For the same year the main heads of estimated expenditure are:

- Public Works: $70,052,241
- Education: $23,385,967
- Medical Services: $26,538,521
- Police: $30,653,147

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March, 1952, amounted to $62,703,000 (approximately $31 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:

- 4% Conversion Loan (1933): $4,838,000
- 3¼% Dollar Loan (1934): $4,280,000
- 3¼% Dollar Loan (1940): $6,602,000
- 3¼% Rehabilitation Loan (1947–48): $46,983,000

The value of the HK$, at approximately HK$1 = 1s. 3d., is kept stable in relation to the £ sterling by an Exchange Equalization Fund.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and to a small extent by two other Banks, and of $1 notes and nickel alloy coins of 50 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents.

Over the five years 1952–57 it is proposed to expend the sum of $260 million on major development projects, $200 million of which will be provided from current revenue and $60 million from the Colony’s Development Fund.

The main items to be financed from the Development Fund are:

- Waterworks (new reservoir at Tai Lam Chung): $40 million
- Housing: $15 million

The main items to be financed from current revenue are as follows:

- New Schools: $8 million
- New Hospitals and Clinics: $38 million
- Government Offices: $25 million
- Government Quarters: $10 million
- City Hall: $16 million
- Reclamation Schemes: $24 million
- Piers: $16 million
- Roads: $22 million
- Abattoir: $15 million
In 1952, 1,039 institutions provided education for some 195,000 pupils, approaching one in ten of the total estimated population. This total attendance figure may be divided as follows:

| Pupils |
|--------|
| Primary | 146,000 |
| Secondary | 42,000 |
| Post-secondary | 7,000 |

Private schools provided places for some 128,000 children and grant or subsidy schools for some 53,000, while the 36 Government institutions catered for about 14,000 pupils. The University of Hong Kong has 871 students studying medicine, art, civil engineering, architecture, science and Chinese languages. There were some 130 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies during 1951-52 and a number elsewhere. The University receives an annual Government grant of $1½ million; in 1951 it benefited by a grant of $4 million from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, the second grant of this amount for capital development, and is to receive a sum of $16 million from Japanese assets taken over in the Colony as reparations. Education Department expenditure in 1950-51 was $4.7 million compared with $2 million in 1937.

Total expenditure on medical, sanitary and allied services including capital expenditure in 1951-52 was about $36 million. Actual Government expenditure in 1950-51 (excluding development) was $12 million compared with $2 million in 1937. In 1951 beds available in hospitals (including maternity homes) totalled 4,177 (Government and Government-aided 3,292, private 885). In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals totalled 91,651, and out-patients, at the three main Government hospitals only, 830,439. Government also organizes health centres in the urban areas, and a large number of clinics and dispensaries in both urban and rural districts. Considering the tremendously overcrowded state of the Colony, the general state of health is remarkably high. There were no epidemics in 1951 and not a single case of the major quarantinable diseases. There is little malnutrition. Cases of tuberculosis, the most serious scourge, approached 14,000 in 1951 with 30% fatalities; pneumonia in all its forms caused nearly 5,000 deaths. The mortality was 91.8 per 1,000 live births.

The airfield at Kai Tak is limited in size by the geographical features of the neighbourhood, but international traffic increased steadily. During 1951 there were 13 companies operating international flights through the Colony, of which two have their head offices in Hong Kong. A total of 5,200 international flights, carrying 75,000 passengers, was reached.

There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has lately been no through rail traffic into China. Total goods carried during 1951 amounted to 276,669 tons, and 3,897,032 passengers were transported.

There are 426 miles of roadway, 90% of which is of modern metalled construction.

During 1951-52, 85,533 vessels entered and cleared, their net registered tonnage being 23,960,207. 1,567,070 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. A frequent ferry service crosses the harbour and links the principal islands to the westward.

Government runs broadcasting services in English, Cantonese, etc., operating on medium and short waves with a power of 2 and 2½ kw. respectively. There were 41,573 licence-holders at the end of 1951. A private concern also operates a rediffusion service on a basis of commercial advertising, with English and Cantonese programmes, to which there are some 45,000 subscribers.

Most of the urban population is engaged in trade or industry in some form, and the rural population in agriculture or fishing; there is considerable fluctuation between various occupations and reliable statistics are, in general, lacking. Estimated figures in 1952 are:

| Industry                  | Number |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture               | 70,000 |
| Fishing                   | 50,000 |
| Government Service (82% on monthly pay) | 25,600 |
| Public Transport (Road, Rail and Water) | 10,000 |
| Textiles                  | 16,500 |
| Dockyards                 | 8,000  |
| Mines                     | 3,500  |
| Other industries          | 65,000 |

The last four figures cover only factories and workshops registered under the law.

In March 1952 there were 210 registered workers' unions, with a declared membership of nearly 173,000, and 78 employers' associations, with a declared membership of over 15,000.

The total area now under cultivation is estimated at 25,000 acres, 17,000 being under paddy and 3,500 under vegetables. Some 16,700 metric tons of milled rice are estimated to be grown annually.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 11,000, pigs 25,000.

About 30,500 tons of fish were marketed in 1951-52 compared with 33,000 tons in the previous year.

Iron ore, kaolin, wolfram ore and small quantities of tin, molybdenum and lead are mined. In 1951, 161,000 tons of iron ore were produced.

The more important of the wide range of goods manufactured in the Colony are: textiles, cotton garments, towels, etc., rubber shoes, enamel and aluminium ware, vacuum flasks, torches and lamps, matches, sulphuric acid, ropes, nets and cordage, ginger, processed foods and plastic products and cement. Production of cement in 1951 was 71,000 tons.

Over 20% of the Colony's total exports in 1951 consisted of locally manufactured articles. The total values of imports and exports by main groups are shown in the table below; there was a change in the basis of classification between 1947 and 1948, with the result that the correlation is not exact.

There are four Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies with a membership of over 700 which is steadily increasing. Four Fish Wholesale Markets are now in operation, the latest having been opened in June 1952 at Aberdeen, the main fishing port. A revolving loan fund of $250,000 has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisher folk; the amount of the fund has already been used four times. The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the central wholesale market at Kowloon from seven collecting centres and depots in the New Territories; four of these are run by the farmers themselves and are being encouraged to develop into co-operative societies.
