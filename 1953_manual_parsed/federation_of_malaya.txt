FEDERATION OF MALAYA

The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,850 square miles. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang and the smallest is the State of Perlis.

The total estimated population at 31st December, 1951, was 5,420,738:

| Group            | Percentage | Population |
|------------------|------------|------------|
| Malaysians        | 49.3%      | 2,673,114  |
| Chinese          | 38.1%      | 2,067,027  |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 11.1%   | 602,388    |
| Europeans        | 0.3%       | 12,810     |
| Eurasians        | 0.2%       | 11,433     |
| Others           | 1.0%       | 53,966     |

5,420,738

The Chinese predominate in the south-western States and in Penang, the commercial and industrial area, whereas there is a bigger percentage of Malaysians in the north and east and in Malacca.

New citizenship legislation which came into force on 15th September, 1952, confers citizenship by operation of law on all subjects of the rulers of the States and certain categories of Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in the Federation. It is impossible to make a very close estimate of the number of citizens by operation of law, but it is thought that they include almost all the Malays and about 60% of the Chinese community.

As a general rule, for non-Malays who are not Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies the qualification necessary for automatic citizenship...
and State nationality is to have been born in the Federation and to have had one parent born there also. Non-Malays without this qualification may, under certain conditions, acquire citizenship by registration or naturalization. The policy behind the legislation is to make citizenship available (i) by operation of law to anyone who by birth can be assumed to be sufficiently assimilated to the life and loyalty of the country; and (ii) by registration or naturalization to others who have reasonable qualifications to be regarded as Malayans.

The Federation occupies the southern section of the Kra Peninsula, which protrudes at the south-eastern corner of Asia between India and China. It is divided by mountain ranges, the main trend of which is north and south. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country, while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains, which are mainly alluvial, and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80% of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp. The coastline of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west lies a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat, with infrequent indentations of bays. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand. Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands (rising to over 2,000 feet) off the north Kedah coast and off the east coast, Tioman and other scattered islands.

The two principal rivers are the Perak and the Pahang, the latter some 200 miles long. It springs in the main range of mountains (highest Gunong Tahan, 7,000 feet). This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory south of the Himalayas.

That part of the country free from forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas, as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other areas, particularly the Kinta Valley, Perak, have been mined for tin.

The principal features of the climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons, which correspond roughly with the summer and winter of northern latitudes. The months between these two seasons, which correspond with spring and autumn of northern latitudes, are the wettest months over most parts of Malaya. Coastal districts, however, have their own peculiar rainy seasons. Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year. Jelebu in Negri Sembilan is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches, and Maxwell's Hill the wettest, with 198 inches a year.

The highest temperature recorded in the plains during 1951 was 98° and the lowest 65°. The average maximum is rather less than 90° and minimum about 70°. At Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 79° and 36° and at Fraser's Hill 81° and 53°. The nights are reasonably cool everywhere and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity, somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not possible at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate is desirable for Europeans if health is to be maintained.

The principal towns are:

| Town          | Population (1947 Census) |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Kuala Lumpur, seat of Federal Government | 175,961 |
| Penang        | 189,068                  |
| Ipoh          | 80,894                   |
| Malacca       | 54,507                   |
| Taiping       | 41,361                   |
| Johore Bahru  | 38,826                   |
| Seremban      | 35,274                   |

In 1786 Francis Light obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795 during the Napoleonic wars, but was handed back to the Dutch in 1814. The loss of Malacca caused Stamford Raffles to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Tumasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. Raffles obtained a concession from the representative of the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. As a free port Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands in 1824 when, by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London, Malaya was recognized as a British sphere of influence. The Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca and Singapore passed from the control of the India Office to that of the Colonial Office in 1867. The extension of British authority into the Peninsula was hastened by unsettled conditions in the Malay States which had deteriorated in some cases into civil war and disorder. In 1873 the new Governor of the Straits Settlements came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the Treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern States and there resulted agreements in that year with Kedah, Kelantan and Perlis and in 1919 with Trengganu. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were in their main features similar. The Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in turn guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each State a British officer was appointed, as resident or adviser, whose advice the rulers agreed to follow in all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The foundations of good government and friendly relations laid by such early residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories in the Commonwealth. In the early years of the century Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a Federation (the Federated Malay States) with a resident-general as chief executive officer, and a system of centralized government was inaugurated. This system lasted in varying forms until 1932, when there was a measure of decentralization by which legislative powers were to some extent restored to the States and the authority of the rulers and residents was reinforced.
Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt stop during the Japanese occupation from December 1941 to August 1945. On the liberation of the country, the Government of the Malayan Union was established, but this administrative system met with strong objections by the Malays and on the 1st February, 1948, a new Constitution came into force. The new Constitution allowed each State and Settlement to retain its individuality under a strong central government.

The Federation of Malaya which comprises the nine Malay states of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu and the two British Settlements of Penang and Malacca, was constituted on 1st February, 1948, by:

(a) the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, between His late Majesty King George VI and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu;

(b) the State Agreements between His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers; and

(c) the Federation of Malaya Order in Council, 1948.

The Federation of Malaya Agreement, as from time to time amended, provides for an Executive Council of 21 members, presided over by the High Commissioner, and for a Legislative Council of 75 members also presided over by the High Commissioner or his Deputy. (It is proposed in due course to appoint a Speaker.) Of the 75 Councillors, 50 are unofficial, representing various economic, commercial, professional and cultural interests, nine are Presidents of the Councils of State in the States, two represent the Settlement Councils of Penang and Malacca, three are ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary) and 11 are Members of the Federal Government, each responsible for certain departments and functions. Their "Portfolios" are Home Affairs, Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, Health, Education, Industrial and Social Relations, Lands, Mines and Communications, Works, Railways and Ports, Chinese Affairs and Defence.

The Federation Agreement also establishes a Conference of Rulers consisting of the rulers of all the Malay States. The Conference meets the High Commissioner at least three times a year.

The State Agreements provide for the establishment of a State Executive Council and a Council of State in each State. The Council of State is the legislative body. In each of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca there is a Nominated Council and a Settlement Council. The Settlement Council, as the local legislative body, corresponds to the Council of State in a Malay State.

The Federation Agreement records the desire of His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers that progress be made towards self-government, and their agreement that, as a first step to this end, legislation shall be introduced as soon as circumstances permit for the election of members to the various legislatures established under the Agreement.

Since June 1948 a state of Emergency has existed in Malaya. Special powers were assumed by the Government in that month to preserve law and order in the face of outbreaks of violence perpetrated by the Malayan Communist Party. Communist terrorists have since then carried out guerrilla operations from jungle bases in an attempt, by ambush, murder and the destruction of property, to impose their will on the Malayan people. They have not succeeded in doing this, but they have caused a great deal of suffering to innocent people. The Government, with the assistance of its locally raised (and largely voluntary) Security Forces, as well as British and Commonwealth troops, and with the support of the large majority of the people of Malaya, has made great efforts to put down terrorism. After the murder in October 1951 of Sir Henry Gurney, the late High Commissioner and a devoted servant of the people of Malaya, General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed High Commissioner and Director of Operations and Mr. D. C. MacGillivray, Deputy High Commissioner. These appointments were the first steps in a widespread reorganization of the Security Forces and other Government machinery. By October 1952 terrorist activity was on the decline and the growing confidence of the people was demonstrated by the increasing flow of information about the terrorists given to the authorities.

The political and social policies of the Government are complementary to the arduous work of the Security Forces in countering the Emergency. The resettlement programme has brought nearly half a million former "squatters", who had been easy prey for the terrorists, into the relative security of New Villages where they are given land, social services and a chance to run their own affairs. Government is very conscious of the need to help these people and others like them to play a fuller and happier part in the life of the Malayan community which must be the foundation of a Malayan nation. The Emergency has not been allowed to bring political progress to a standstill and the directive given to Sir Gerald Templer on his appointment as High Commissioner in February 1952 reaffirmed the determination of Her Majesty's Government to see law and order restored in Malaya, and to help the evolution out of her diverse races of a united nation fit for self-government.

The Torrens system of registration of title to land is in force in the Federation, except in the Settlements of Penang and Malacca where it is intended to introduce registration of title as soon as is practicable. Most alienated land is held in perpetuity on payment of an annual rent to Government. It is now the usual practice, however, to alienate town land on 99-year leases. Malay Reservations have been created within which land may not be alienated to non-Malays. State land, not lying within Malay Reservations, and Crown land may be alienated to Federal citizens and non-Federal citizens.

The most important form of taxation is indirect by means of export duties on rubber and tin, and import duties on tobacco, beers, spirits, petrol and textiles. The main form of direct taxation is income tax. All persons not resident in the Federation are chargeable at a flat rate of 20%. There is provision for relief for a non-resident British subject or a non-resident British protected person. In the case of individuals resident in the Federation, $3,000 is deducted from assessable income if the individual is unmarried. A further allowance of $2,000 is made to a married man. Allowances are also made in respect of children up to nine in number, for life assurance premiums paid, and for obligatory or contractual contributions to approved pension or provident funds.
The rate of tax varies from 3% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 30% on chargeable income in excess of $50,000. The rate of tax payable by companies was raised to 30% in 1951. A double taxation relief arrangement with the United Kingdom is in operation.

The following is a table of public finance.

The nine State and two Settlement Governments have their own budgets for local administration which are balanced by allocations from Federal funds. The figures given above represent the totals of Federal, State and Settlement revenue and expenditure in each year. The figures of revenue for 1949 and 1950 include contributions from His Majesty's Government in aid of defence expenditure of $42,857,143 (£5 million) and $25,714,286 (£3 million) respectively. Approximately 72% of the revenue in 1951 was derived from Customs and excise and 17% from income tax.

The Public Debt of the Federation of Malaya at the end of December 1951 amounted to $261,767,856 (approximately $49 per head of population):

- External 3% F.M.S. Sterling Loan, 1960–70: $34,285,714
- External 3% F.M.S. Sterling Loan, 1974–76: $69,000,000
- Internal 4½% F.M.S. Local Loan, 1959: $16,000,000
- Internal 3% F.M.S. Local Loan, 1956–66: $15,000,000

- Internal F.M. Share of S.S. Public Debt (34%): $14,849,629

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is exclusive legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency notes of denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent, issued by:

(a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners.
(b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.
(ii) Silver dollars and half-dollars.
(iii) Subsidiary silver and other coin of various denominations below $1.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The total amount of currency in circulation on 31st December, 1951, was: notes $764,109,202, coins $44,603,301.

A six-year Draft Development Plan was prepared in 1950 and it is intended that its revision should be undertaken as soon as circumstances permit. The latest estimates of the cost of schemes in the Development Plan show expenditure up to 1957 of the following order:

| $ million | Per cent. |
|-----------|-----------|
| Basic Services | 445 | 53·3 |
| Social Services | 246 | 29·5 |
| Productive Services | 144 | 17·2 |
| Total | 835 | 100·0 |

Basic Services.—26·5% of the total expenditure will be devoted to the development of electricity, 12·0% to railways and 4·1% to water supplies.

Social Services.—11·3% of the total expenditure (up to 1952) will be spent on the resettlement of squatters in New Villages, 7·3% on education and 7·0% on housing.

Productive Services.—10·4% of the total expenditure will be allocated to the Rural and Industrial Development Authority for projects of all kinds directed towards the development of rural areas and 4·5% on drainage and irrigation works.

The sources of funds are:

(a) the Malayan allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts $42·8 million.
(b) the Colonial Development Corporation, which so far has provided over $60 million towards the development of electric power;
(c) Federation of Malaya Government Loans $200 million;
(d) Revenue; and
(e) other sources not yet explored.

The University of Malaya, serving the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, has faculties of Arts, Science and Medicine. In the 1951–52 session there were 494 students from the Federation. The Technical College, Kuala Lumpur, had 220 students, and the Agricultural College, Serdang, 65 students. Government awards scholarships and bursaries for higher education, tenable at the University of Malaya or in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. There are now 300 students being trained as teachers at the Malayan Teachers' Training College, Kirkby, Liverpool, and in addition there are over 600 Malayan students at Universities and centres of higher learning overseas. In 1951 there were 119,006 pupils in 373 English Schools (schools for mixed races where the medium of instruction is English) 292,587 pupils in 1,778 Malay Schools, 207,133 pupils in 1,206 Chinese Schools and 37,817 pupils in 865 Indian Schools. Adult Education Associations have been formed in most of the States.
Expenditure on Educational Services in 1951 was about $81,295,920 of which $39,163 was contributed by the United Kingdom under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. The sum expended from the Colonial Development and Welfare funds was on the first phases of a large programme. In 1947 the expenditure on Educational Services was $29,167,466. It is not possible to make a comparison with the amount spent on Educational Services before the war as at that time the Federation of Malaya did not exist as such.

The total expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1951 was $38,693,817 compared with $16,623,487 in 1947.

In 1951 Government maintained 70 hospitals with 13,143 beds: general 8,895, maternity 1,219 and infectious—including pulmonary tuberculosis—3,029. In addition, Government maintains four institutions with 3,476 beds for the treatment of leprosy and one mental hospital of 3,000 beds. Another mental hospital, with an accommodation of 1,200 when fully rehabilitated, will be in use in 1953. At Government hospitals the total number of in-patients treated was 241,716 (general 233,003, mental 5,056 and leprosy 3,657). On rubber estates there are 131 hospitals maintained privately with 5,858 beds. 81,937 in-patients were admitted during 1951. Treatment of the rural population is carried out through dispensaries (including mobile road and river boat units) and infant welfare centres. These number 107, 68, 14 and 211 respectively, and the total number of new cases treated was 3,346,095.

The principal diseases treated in Government hospitals throughout the Federation were malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, dysentery, diarrhoea and enteritis, pneumonia, bronchitis, beriberi, venereal diseases, enteric fever.

The main anti-malarial measures in towns and villages are sub-soil drainage by permanent works, oiling and D.D.T. spraying of houses. Water supplies are treated according to modern methods, sanitation is either water-borne or by bucket system of removal in all the towns.

The main international air traffic for Malaya uses the airport at Singapore, passengers and cargo being carried to the Federation by Malayan Airways or the Federation Air Service. Two international airports are situated at Kota Bharu and Penang. Manned aerodromes for internal services are Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Alor Star, Kuantan and Malacca. There are a large number of unmanned and private aerodromes for feeder services. Internal services are run by Malayan Airways Limited who also operate the Government-owned Federation Air Service. Meteorological services are available and controlled by the Malayan Meteorological Service with headquarters in Singapore. Aircraft movements were 30,375 in 1951, carrying 19,357 passengers and 1,855 tons of cargo.

The railway route mileage open to traffic in 1951 was 912; the main-line runs from Singapore 488 miles north-westwards to Prai (opposite Penang Island); there are short branches to the west coast, and a longer branch (99 miles) from Bukit Mertajam northwards to the Thailand frontier at Padang Besar; the east coast line runs from Gemas (137 miles from Singapore) northwards 327 miles to Tumpat on the north-east coast of the peninsula, but 200 miles of track here were removed by the Japanese. At the end of 1951, 88 miles had been restored, 20 were open to construction trains, and a gap of 92 miles remained to be restored. There is connexion with the Royal Thai Railways both at Padang Besar and near Tumpat. Passenger journeys in 1951 totalled 6,735,000 and paying goods tonnage 2,038,000. Gross revenue reached the record figure of $52.5 million; expenditure was $45.7 million. Attacks by Communist terrorists seriously handicapped the operation of the railway.

The public road system covers 6,192 miles, 2,176 miles of which are classified as Federal roads, and the remainder as State roads. Details of construction are shown below:

| Class | Type | Mileage |
|-------|------|---------|
| A     | Concrete surface | 21 |
|       | Metalled surface grouted or sealed with bitumen | 4,058 |
| B     | Metalled surface, waterbound | 311 |
| C     | Hard surface, bitumen sealed | 224 |
| D     | Hard surface, waterbound | 897 |

The principal ports in the Federation are Penang and Port Swettenham, the sum of entrances and clearances and the net registered tonnages of ships of 75 tons and over which entered and cleared thereat during 1951 were:

Penang ... ... ... 3,642 9,671,657
Port Swettenham ... 2,222 9,323,154

Tonnages of cargo discharged and loaded from and to vessels of over 75 tons net register were:

Freight tons
Penang ... ... ... 1,608,434
Port Swettenham ... ... 1,176,742

Navigational aids around the coast are maintained by the Marine Department.

Services to and from the United Kingdom are provided by the main shipping companies on the Far Eastern service. Local companies provide coastal services and services to ports in South-East Asia.

The Department of Broadcasting is pan-Malayan. It maintains stations of "Radio Malaya" at Kuala Lumpur (two 10 kw. medium wave transmitters, one 5 kw. shortwave), Penang (two 2 kw. medium wave), and Malacca (one 50 watt medium wave) but much of the Federation is served by "Radio Malaya," Singapore. There were 69,493 licence holders in the Federation on 31st December, 1951, including 8,730 subscribers to Rediffusion (Malaya) Limited. Over 1,100 schools in the Federation are equipped with receivers for the reception of school broadcasts from Radio Malaya. Special rural broadcasts in Malay, Tamil, Hakka, Cantonese and Mandarin are heard on about 1,000 community receivers installed in rural areas by the Government and on receivers installed on several hundred mines and estates for the benefit of the workers.

Apart from the large numbers who are self-employed in peasant agriculture or fishing, the larger part of the working population is engaged directly or indirectly in the rubber industry.

Rubber plantations and estates ... 286,000
Rubber smallholdings ... (estimate) 200,000
Coconut, oil-palm and tea plantations ... 27,000
Tin industry ... ... ... 44,000
Other industries ... ... ... 66,000
Government Service ... ... ... 60,000
These figures apply only to "labourers" as defined in the Labour Laws of the territory.

There are 218 registered trade unions of employers and employees, consisting of 120 Civil Servants' Unions, 91 Industrial Workers' Unions and seven Employers' Unions. Civil Servants' Unions have 39,702 members who are drawn from all races and from 20 different types of Government occupations. Industrial Workers' Unions have 80,605 members drawn from about 30 different categories of employment. The seven Employers' Unions have a membership of 1,076. The Rubber and Tin Employers' Unions are the most important. The total membership is 121,383. An approximate break-down by races is 74% Indians, 15% Chinese, 9% Malays and 2% others.

The main crops are rubber, rice, oil palm, coconut, pineapples and tea. 603,880 tons of rubber were produced in 1951.

The livestock population numbers: cattle 477,000, goats 252,000, sheep 22,000, swine 280,000, equines 500.

Exports of sawn timber in 1951 amounted to 4,314,000 cubic feet, of which 2,144,000 went to the United Kingdom. On 31st December, 1951, there were 254 sawmills, two plywood factories and three match factories in operation.

The coastal waters are heavily fished with a variety of gears, and there is extensive inland fishing from rivers, ponds and padi fields. Total landings are in the region of 160,000 tons, of which 25,000 tons are freshwater. The estimated value of the catch is $240,000,000. Much of the available fish is pelagic fish, the most important being Rastrelliger kanagurta or Ikan Kembong, a Scombrid.

Tin is by far the most important mineral won. The 1951 output of concentrates from some 750 mines, had a tin content of 57,167 tons. Coal, gold, iron, bauxite, scheelite, wolfram, ilmenite, columbite and corundum are also produced.
