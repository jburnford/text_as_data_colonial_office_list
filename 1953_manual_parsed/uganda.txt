UGANDA

The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles, of which 13,680 are water and swamp.

The total population of the Protectorate as shown by the 1948 census—excluding Polish refugees and a very small number of persons in transit—was 4,958,520, made up as follows:

- Africans . . . . 4,917,555
- Indians . . . . 33,767
- Goans . . . . 1,448
- Arabs . . . . 1,475
- Europeans . . . . 3,448
- Others . . . . 827

The estimated total by the end of 1951 was about 5,200,000.

The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale, in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,000 feet or less in the neighbourhood of Lake Albert and the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges in Uganda, the Mufumbiro or Birung range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhavura (13,547 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley, with its twin peaks Margharita (16,794 feet) and Alexandra (16,749 feet) is the highest mountain. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasien (10,050 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, which flows both east and west between Lake George and Lake Victoria, the Aswa, which rises north of Lake Kyoga and flows into the White Nile in the Sudan, and the Malawa, which rises in Mount Elgon and flows through the Mpologoma Swamp into Lake Kyoga. The total area of forest is approximately 2,684 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.

The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° and 75° and at Entebbe the mean temperature, the mean maximum and the mean minimum are 70°, 78°, and 63° respectively. The average annual rainfall varies between 40 and 55 inches, according to the area, over most of Uganda. The rainy season is not well-defined but there is generally one dry season from December to February and one fairly dry season from June to July.

The principal towns are Entebbe (capital), Kampala and Jinja. Administrative and trading centres also exist at Tororo, Mbale, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale, Masaka and Mubende.

In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa’s dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there were a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company’s influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga’s Kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June, 1894.

Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga’s kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1900 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and he concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. The next year similar Agreements were made with the Chiefs in Toro and Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes, and the same principles of “indirect rule” were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1903 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw...
further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika Territory. In 1903 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.

By the Uganda Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, both consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated 5th June, 1920, as amended by subsequent instructions, the Executive Council consists of six ex-officio members, and such other persons holding office in the Public Service (official members), and such other persons not holding such office (unofficial members), as the Governor may appoint, with the Governor as President. There are at present two official and six unofficial members. It is further provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor as President, six ex-officio members, with official and unofficial members. There are now ten official members in addition to the six ex-officio members, and 16 unofficial members.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern, and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the remainder owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka with the advice of his three Ministers, the Chief Minister, Principal Judge and Treasurer. A hierarchy of chiefs are the executive officers of government. A similar system of administration prevails in the three agreement districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro. In other districts, African Local Governments have been established, the principal officers being a Secretary-General, Treasurer and Principal Judge. County, sub-county, parish and village chiefs are the executive officers of local government and are advised and assisted by councils, which are now established in every province. These are at five levels—the parish, the sub-county, the county, the district and the province—which provide a chain of election from the bottom upwards. In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces, the district council is the most important organ of government. In Buganda province, however, where the assembly is at the provincial level, district councils do not exist and unofficial members are elected direct from the county councils to the "Great Lukiko" (i.e. the council of Buganda). All Chiefs in Buganda and the three agreement districts are appointed by the Ruler with the approval of the Governor. Elsewhere, appointment of Chiefs is by the Governor direct, though recommendations may come from a local council. Chiefs are now by legal definition the executive officers of local government and they combine in their functions administrative, judicial and fiscal duties.

Alienation of land to non-natives is now almost entirely suspended except for land required for mining purposes and within townships. Ownership of land may not be transferred to a non-native without the Governor's consent. There are a few non-native estates.

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll taxes, export taxes, companies tax, Customs and excise.

Income Tax is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from, or received in, East Africa by residents, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents, after deducting any personal allowances. Any person liable to pay Native Poll Tax is exempt from paying income tax. This exempts all Africans. A surtax is imposed on every £ of total income in excess of £2,000, rising to Shs. 45,187/- on a total income of £9,500. Thereafter the next £10,500 is charged Shs. 10/- for every £ and the next £30,000, Shs. 10/50 for every £. Where total income exceeds £50,000 per annum the rate on the excess is Shs. 11/- in every £.

Poll Tax is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of Shs. 6/- per year with the exception that in Buganda province it is levied at the rate of Shs. 15/- or Shs. 10/- according to district and locality. A Native Administration Tax is levied by African local governments varying from Shs. 6/- to Shs. 22/- according to district. Non-Native Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £5 on incomes exceeding £200 per annum, and £3 on lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

Export Taxes are placed on lint, cotton and coffee and are operated on a sliding scale.

Companies Tax is levied at the rate of Shs. 4/- on every £ of chargeable income accrued in, derived from, or received in the Protectorate.

Customs and Excise. The tariff is divided into ad valorem, specific and free goods. Ad valorem duties vary from 10% to 60%, the latter assessment only applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations. The basic rate of import duty is 22% ad valorem, assessed on the price goods will fetch on sale in the open market at the port of first importation into the territory, freight, insurance and all the costs, charges and expenses having been paid by the seller. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:

| Product       | Duty Rate |
|---------------|-----------|
| Sugar         | Shs. 2/4 per cwt. |
| Cigarettes    | Shs. 8/- per lb. |
| Cigars        | Shs. 8/- per lb. |
| Manufactured tobacco | Shs. 7/- per lb. |
| Beer          | Shs. 180/- for each 36 gallons of worts at specific gravity of 1055. |

The following is a table of public finance in the Protectorate.

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 1,863,863   | 2,019,655       |
| 1939 | 1,717,927   | 2,739,557       |
| 1946 | 4,053,237   | 3,574,194       |
| 1947 | 5,331,222   | 4,473,773       |
| 1948 | 6,405,030   | 6,530,444       |
| 1949 | 8,094,381   | 6,686,863       |
| 1950 | 11,036,701  | 8,000,380       |
| 1951 | 15,826,280  | 12,345,508      |

In 1951 51·3% of revenue was derived from export taxes, 24·4% from Customs and excise and 7·7% from direct taxes.

At the end of 1951 the Public Debt amounted to £3,950,000.

The currency is under the control of the East African Currency Board in London. The unit of currency is the shilling, which is sub-divided into 100 cents. Coins and notes of the following denominations circulate in Uganda:

- Coins: Sh. 1/-, 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent.
- Notes: Shs. 5/-, 10/-, 20/-, 100/-, and 200/-.
Shs. 1,000/- and 10,000/- notes are used only for transactions between the Banks and the Currency Board and are not in general circulation.

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945, Uganda received an allocation of £2,500,000 as a contribution towards her Ten-Year Development Plan. The Plan envisaged a total Government expenditure of £42,500,000 over the decennium, of which £40,000,000 was to be provided from Protectorate sources. In 1948 the Plan was revised and provision was made for the total anticipated Protectorate expenditure of £62,743,000 for the period 1946-56. Of this expenditure approximately 29% is being spent on Social Services and 12% on Productive Services.

The Government have established the Uganda Development Corporation with a capital of £5,000,000 to develop the resources of the Protectorate and to assist private enterprise in the establishment of new industries. It is intended that the Corporation shall take over the Government's interest in several projects now being undertaken, such as the manufacture of cement, fish marketing, textile manufacture. It also plans to engage in the development of mining, hotels, and paper manufacture. The mineral deposits at Sukulu, near Tororo, are being opened up by a syndicate, which has recently been formed by various mining companies in conjunction with the Uganda Development Corporation. A pilot separation plant is being set up which should be in operation at the beginning of 1954. The construction of the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja by the Uganda Electricity Board, a Government-financed utility corporation, is due for completion in 1954 and will provide an output of 90,000 kw. of power. The copper and cobalt deposits at Kilembe are being developed.

There are 3,314 Primary schools, 149 Secondary schools and two institutes of higher education—Makerere College (the University College of East Africa) and the Government training college for Junior Secondary school teachers at Mbarara. In 1951 there were 246,896 pupils in Primary schools, 12,440 in Secondary schools (including 2,620 in technical schools) and 2,189 in teacher-training centres, 30 in the Government training college and 91 Uganda students at Makerere College. At the beginning of 1952 100 students were studying in the United Kingdom, of whom 48 were Africans; eight Africans were studying in the U.S.A. and six in India.

Apart from two full Secondary schools, the teacher-training college, and five Junior Secondary technical schools, all controlled by Government, African primary and secondary education is in the hands of the Missions who receive substantial grants-in-aid from Government. Government expenditure on African education amounted to £852,879 in 1951 out of a total of £1,344,769 from all sources. Government expenditure in 1935 was £76,093.

Malaria, respiratory infections and injuries are among the commoner conditions needing treatment. Yaws, schistosomiasis, venereal disease and leprosy are also important causes of ill-health, while malnutrition during infancy is being increasingly recognized as a major problem. Steady progress is being made in health education which aims especially at the improvement of rural sanitary conditions and the promotion of higher standards of personal hygiene.

The main hospitals for all communities are at Kampala. The largest Government African Hospital is on Mulago Hill, and is closely associated with the Makerere College Medical School. The Medical Department maintains 18 hospitals at district centres, together with eight rural hospitals and a network of 148 dispensaries. The dispensaries are in the charge of medical auxiliaries. Missionary societies provide seven hospitals and 38 small units. The total number of beds available at hospitals and dispensaries throughout the Protectorate is 6,152, that is, 1·2 beds per 1,000 of the population. In 1951 the number of patients admitted to Government hospitals was 88,025, and 775,532 were treated as out-patients. For all Government units, 2,417,040 patients were treated and 4,839,025 attendances were recorded.

Expenditure by the Medical Department rose from £148,907 in 1935 to £742,244 in 1951.

Entebbe has a first-class international airport and is a principal stopping place on the B.O.A.C. "Comet" route to South Africa. Other airlines operating through Entebbe regularly include Sabena and E.A.A.C., which give rapid connexions to all parts of the world. In addition Entebbe is a staging point on many charter flights. There are also landing grounds at Kasese, Jinja, Tororo, Mbarara, Masindi, Gulu, Soroti, Arua, Lira, Moroto and Lolelia.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration ("see under 'East Africa High Commission'") which also maintains a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga between Namasagali and Masindi Port; and on Lake Victoria between Port Bell, Entebbe, Kisumu and Tanganyika ports. A service is maintained on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule (connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan) and between Butiaba and the Belgian Congo port of Kasenyi. A road transport service operates between Masindi Port and Butiaba. A through service is thus provided by the Railway Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Belgian Congo.

There are 2,457 miles of all-weather main roads, radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres, and about 6,000 miles of excellent roads maintained by the African local governments.

A projected broadcasting service, which will be a responsibility of the Department of Information and Public Relations, is due to be in operation in 1953. The station will be at Kampala.

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle raising on their own account. An analysis of the numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in agriculture and other occupations shows: agriculture 35,100; Government service 9,554; African local government 28,473; grinning 21,184; forestry and fishing 4,496; transport and communications 6,495; wholesale and retail trade 4,107; manufactures, including electricity 21,820; mining and quarrying 7,832; construction 39,815; other services, etc., 14,090; Total 192,966.

The foregoing figures were obtained from a census covering all known employers of five or more persons excluding domestic servants. The figures are not, therefore, complete since many thousands of Africans work in ones and twos for African employers.

Little interest has yet been shown in trade unionism, and as a result the only form trade union machinery can take is staff organizations of works departments. For the past two years the Labour Department has been striving to promote this form of joint consultation in the major
employment establishments, and there are now 30 joint staff committees operating in different parts of the country and covering some 25,000 employees.

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), groundnuts, maize, sugar, tea, and tobacco.

The number of cattle marketed in 1951 was 52,380.

Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hardwoods. Internal consumption is rising rapidly and most of the timber available for export is absorbed by the other East African territories, from which in return the bulk of the Protectorate's softwood imports are obtained. In 1951 21,871 tons of sawn timber were produced and 1,988 tons were exported compared with 25,120 tons and 17,454 tons in 1947.

The chief minerals are tin and wolfram of which 164 and 161 long tons respectively were produced in 1951. In addition small quantities of gold, niobium-tantalum, galena and bismuth are produced.

Fishing is an important industry and large quantities of fish are consumed by the African population. There is also a considerable export trade.

In the 1951-52 season 158 cotton ginneries were operating. There are 14 tea factories, all carrying out the full processing; four coffee curing works and six hulleries, the latter carrying out the early stages of processing only. Technical improvements with coffee are constantly being made. There are also two tobacco factories, two metal utensil factories, a tin food container factory, a tannery, a brewery and a non-alcoholic beverages factory. The Uganda Cement Industries should be in production in 1953. Over 40 soap factories are scattered throughout the Protectorate, the great majority of which could be classed as cottage industries; only four have modern machinery and plant. Maize milling thrives in a small way and 164 licences to grist have been issued.

| Year | Net Imports (£000) | Re-exports (£000) | Domestic Exports (£000) |
|------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 1937 | 2,387             | 85               | 5,576                  |
| 1938 | 2,635             | 257              | 4,551                  |
| 1946 | 5,065             | 161              | 8,879                  |
| 1947 | 6,486             | 262              | 10,691                 |
| 1948 | 8,995             | 404              | 13,501                 |
| 1949 | 12,546            | 101              | 23,433                 |
| 1950 | 15,402            | 210              | 28,669                 |
| 1951 | 22,138            | 246              | 47,197                 |

(These figures include bullion and specie, but exclude all inter-territorial trade with Kenya and Tanganyika.)

In 1951 46·4% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 18·4% from other Commonwealth countries and 35·2% from foreign countries.

In 1951 30·1% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 35·3% to other Commonwealth countries, and 34·6% to foreign countries.

Principal Exports by Volume and Value

| Item          | 1938 | 1950 | 1951 |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| Cotton        | 000 tons | 72   | 62   | 62   |
| Cotton Seed   | 000 tons | 123  | 49   | 31   |
| Coffee        | 000 cwt. | 328  | 8,332| 13,654|
| Hides and Skins | 000 cwt. | 32   | 41   | 44   |
| Sugar         | 000 cwt. | 139  | 57   | 7    |
| Fish          | tons   | 682  | 1,980| 2,145|

The chief imports are tobacco (unmanufactured), artificial textile piece-goods, cotton piece-goods, jute bags and sacks, gasoline, cement, galvanized iron, motor cars and cycles.

Provision has been made by legislation for the organized marketing of cotton and coffee, the two main cash crops of the Protectorate. Producer prices are announced before the marketing seasons open; it has also been the practice to announce a minimum guaranteed price for cotton at planting time. The Cotton Price Assistance Fund at the end of the 1951-52 season stood at £31½ million, and it is proposed that amounts in the Fund or accruing to it in excess of £20 million should be allocated to an African Development Fund, to be used for the benefit of the African community. It is intended that the Coffee Price Assistance Fund, built up of contributions from African production for the benefit of African producers only, which, at the end of 1951 contained £9 million, should be similarly reduced to £3 million, when the scheme for the reorganization of the coffee industry, now under consideration, is introduced.

The number of co-operative societies has grown from 4 in 1947 to 401 at the end of 1951, with a membership of over 36,000, who marketed produce valued at almost £150,000 during that year; it is expected that by the end of 1952 a total of 600 societies will have been registered.

Five cotton ginneries are now being run by African Co-operative Unions. Under the Acquisition of Ginneries Ordinance, 1952, Government has powers over a five-year period to acquire up to 20 ginneries for operation by African co-operative enterprise.
