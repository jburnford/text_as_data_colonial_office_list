BRUNEI

The State is situated on the north-east of Borneo and has an area of 2,226 square miles.

At the 1947 census the population was 40,657. In 1951 it was estimated at 46,500 consisting of:

| European | 1% |
|----------|----|
| Malay    | 41%|
| Melanau  | 5% |
| Sea Dyak | 2% |
| Other indigenous | 25% |
| Chinese  | 24% |
| Other non-indigenous | 2% |
| Asiatic  | 2% |

Brunei has a coastline of about 100 miles, and is split into two and surrounded on the landward sides by Sarawak. In the west the valleys of the Belait and the Tutong rivers, representing more than half the area of the country, consist of extensive swamps gradually changing through a series of ridge and swamp formations into low hills at the sources of the rivers. The Labi hills in the extreme west cover an area of some 300 square miles and at no point exceed 1,300 feet in height. In the east the Brunei district is characterized by a number of steep rocky hills of no great height rising from alluvial flats, while Temburong, except near the coast, is hilly, becoming mountainous as one approaches Bukit Pagon, a spur from the main Bornean range.

There are no well-defined seasons, but the rainfall tends to be heaviest from October to the middle of January. The temperature rarely exceeds 90°; the usual daily range is between 76° and 86°.

The principal towns are:

| Brunei (capital) | 10,700 |
| Seria        | 12,000 |
| Kuala Belait | 6,000 |

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the sixteenth century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the northern part of the island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some parts of the Philippines. Towards the end of the sixteenth century its power began to decline, the outlying territories gradually fell away, and by the beginning of the nineteenth century the kingdom of Brunei had dwindled so as to include only what is now Sarawak and part of British North Borneo.

At this period the town itself seems to have degenerated to the condition of a slave market for the sale of captives of the Illanun and Sulu pirates. Anarchy was rife in the outlying districts, and in 1841 Sarawak proper was ceded to Mr. (later Sir James) Brooke in return for his services in quelling an insurrection at Kuching, and he was declared Rajah of Sarawak. In 1846 the island of Labuan was ceded to Great Britain as a base for anti-piracy measures, and in 1877 the whole of the northern portion of Borneo was ceded to form the nucleus of what was to become British North Borneo. At various later dates further cessions were made to the Rajah of Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company till the territories of the State were eventually reduced to their present circumscribed limits.

In 1847 the Sultan entered into a Treaty with Great Britain for the furtherance of commercial relations and the mutual suppression of piracy. An additional clause provided for extra-territorial jurisdiction over British subjects in Brunei, which provision was modified by an Agreement of 1856. By a further Treaty made in 1888 Brunei was placed under the protection of Great Britain, and the Sultan agreed that the foreign relations of the State should be conducted by Her Majesty's Government. Provision was also made for the setting up of Consular Courts with jurisdiction over British subjects and foreign subjects enjoying British protection. In 1906 a supplementary Agreement was entered into whereby the Sultan undertook to accept a British officer, to be styled Resident, who should be the agent and representative of the British Government under the High Commissioner. (The Governor of Sarawak is also High Commissioner for Brunei.)

The supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan in Council. The State Council consists of 12 members, including the British Resident, with the Sultan as President. The assent of the Council is required for the enactment of legislation and important questions of policy are referred to it.

The general functions of administration are carried out by a British Resident under the supervision of the Governor of Sarawak as High Commissioner. By a Treaty of 1906 the Resident's advice must be asked and acted upon in all questions other than those affecting the Mohammadan religion. The seat of Government is in Brunei Town and there are Assistant Residents at Kuala Belait and at Headquarters.

In the State a transfer charge, lease or sub-lease of land to a person who is not a natural born...
subject of the Sultan, or who has not resided in the State for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than seven years during the ten years immediately preceding the date on which such instrument is delivered to the Land Officer, shall be subject to, and shall not be valid or registered without, the approval of the Sultan in Council.

Taxation takes the form of import, export and excise duties; a royalty paid by the British Malayan Petroleum Company, based upon the amount of oil produced; a variety of licences, mostly of a municipal nature. There is no income tax except upon companies. These are taxed at the rate of 20% upon their chargeable income.

The following is a table of public finance in the State:

| Year   | Revenue     | Expenditure |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1938   | $1,179,979  | $1,476,725  |
| 1939   | $1,274,644  | $1,181,325  |
| 1946 (July–Dec.) | $774,145    | $679,596    |
| 1947   | $4,389,974  | $1,797,598  |
| 1948   | $6,586,299  | $3,740,254  |
| 1949   | $8,736,148  | $4,223,993  |
| 1950   | $17,312,869 | $7,112,505  |
| 1951   | $69,390,905 | $7,488,048  |

The State is a party to the Malayan Currency Agreement and Malayan currency is the only legal tender.

The standard coin is the Malayan silver dollar with a par of 2s. 4d., at which it is linked to sterling. Subsidiary coins are 50, 20, 10 and 5 cent pieces. There is also copper coin of 1 cent. Currency notes are issued in different denominations from 50 cents upwards.

The general revenue surplus is amply sufficient to finance the rehabilitation and development of the State within its needs. The re-building of the devastated towns of Brunei, Kuala Belait and Tutong is being financed largely by Government and is now well under way. The small Public Works Department are engaged in a large programme of housing, roads, bridges, wharves, water supply schemes, etc. The Departments of Agriculture and Forestry, though handicapped by lack of trained staff, are expanding rapidly. Many new schools have been opened and more are planned; hospital services have also expanded greatly.

The number and types of institutions providing educational facilities are (a) 29 Malay Vernacular Schools, wholly maintained by Government. English is taught from the beginning of the fourth year. The present enrolment is 2,290, of which 414 are girls. (b) Two English Schools, wholly maintained by Government, combined enrolment 66. Malay and Chinese are taught as second languages as there are both Malay and Chinese pupils. These schools, one of which was opened at the end of 1951 and the other early in 1952, integrate the vernacular and English education systems in that entry to them can only be obtained by children who have passed the fourth year in a Vernacular School. (c) Three English Schools run by the Roman Catholic Mission and maintained from the proceeds of school fees, by grants-in-aid from Government, and, in the case of one school in the Seria Oilfield area, by a grant from the British Malayan Petroleum Company. The combined enrolment is 1,072, of which 420 are girls. With the exception of one, which has a small Junior Secondary Section, these are Primary Schools. (d) Seven Chinese Vernacular Schools (Primary) run by Chinese communities in various urban and rural centres. They are partially grant-aided. The combined enrolment is 1,483, of which 584 are girls. (e) A special English school run by the British Malayan Petroleum Company in the oilfield area. This is a mixed preparatory school on the lines of those in England and caters for European children between the ages of 5 and 11. Its enrolment is 110. (f) A Trade School, wholly maintained by the Company and open to local boys who have passed Standard Primary V in an English school. An apprenticeship system is followed and the trades taught are associated with mechanical engineering, metal work, welding, blacksmithing.

No Brunei students are as yet studying in Universities overseas but eight Malay Vernacular School teachers are undergoing a course in Teachers' Training Colleges in Malaya and 19 in Sarawak, and six students are attending Sarawak Secondary English Schools, all at Government expense.

Expenditure on education in 1951 was $374,996 compared with $7,289 in 1930.

The principal diseases are those common to the tropics, viz. malaria, helminthic diseases, tropical anaemias, avitaminosis, inflammatory diseases of the eyes, dysentery, typhoid fever, filariasis, hookworms, infectious hepatitis. Other diseases, in order of prevalence, are: diseases of the respiratory system, tuberculosis, pneumonia, venereal diseases, cataract, oitis media and glaucoma. Infant mortality and morbidity rates are high.

The State Medical Service is only developed at present in towns and the indigenous Malay population is averse to entering hospital or even seeking skilled medical advice. The Health Department is small with two Health Inspectors in Brunei Town, and one in Kuala Belait and Seria, responsible for health and port health work. At Kuala Belait and Seria the Malayan Petroleum Company assist in anti-malaria work. A new Infant and Child Welfare and Maternity Service is spreading its activities into the countryside. Prevention has concentrated on malaria eradication for towns, protection against smallpox and the enteric fevers by inoculation, general sanitation and conservancy and the hospital segregation of open cases of tuberculosis. It is intended to extend disease prevention by instituting a Tuberculosis Clinic, propaganda to decrease helminthic infestation and, after survey, to try and lessen the human reservoir of filariasis.

There is one 150-bedded State Hospital in Brunei Town, one 14-bedded Dispensary in Kuala Belait and the Oil Company also has a 150-bedded Hospital at Kuala Belait. There are two out-station dispensaries with 16 beds, and a small Tuberculosis Hospital with 22 beds has been constructed at Kuala Belait. Three floating dispensaries serve the riverain population and are not only bringing medicine to the homes of the people but also serving as a spearhead of propaganda.

During 1951 there were:
- Hospital in-patients: 1,672
- Hospital out-patients: 40,204
- Ante-natal attendances: 7,329
- Travelling dispensary attendances: 3,849

During 1951 the Medical Department budget amounted to $414,746. There are no comparable pre-war figures as there was then no large Hospital.
There is no aerodrome in Brunei of International Code Letter E size, but the British Malayan Petroleum Company have an airfield for their private use at Anduki near Seria. They also maintain a light railway from Seria to Badas about eight miles long.

There are 76 miles of roads, metalled 33 miles, earth 43 miles.

The main ports are Brunei Town and Kuala Belait. The bulk of general cargo for Brunei is transhipped from Labuan and conveyed to the two main ports by a fleet of small coasting vessels run by the Straits Steamship Company. Monthly visits are made to the Port of Brunei Town direct from Singapore by this Company's vessels of up to 1,700 G.E.T. The British Malayan Petroleum Company also maintains a considerable fleet of L.C.Ts., and these ply mainly between Brunei Town, Labuan and Kuala Belait. In addition, numerous native-owned motor launches, tongkangs, and outboard motor boats carry on a coastal trade around the Brunei and adjacent Colonies' ports. The State runs a motor launch service connecting with the air service and, as far as possible, the steamer service in Labuan, carrying mail and passengers.

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. Numbers employed in other occupations in 1951 were: Government service (Public Works) 610, oil mining 3,468 and rubber and cutch 539.

The main crops are padi, rubber and sago. In 1951, 9,714 tons, 5,161,694 lb. and 245 tons respectively were produced.

The estimated livestock population in 1951 was: cattle 10,477, pigs 4,353 and poultry 49,000.

The production of crude oil from the Seria field by the British Malayan Petroleum Company was 855,499 tons in 1940, 4,057,000 tons in 1950 and 37,133,500 barrels in 1951.
