KENYA

The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East African Protectorate, includes parts of the great African Lakes, Victoria Nyanza and Rudolf; the land area is approximately 219,730 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 224,960 square miles.

At 31st December, 1951, the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at over 5·7 million persons, of whom over 5·5 million were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe     | Per cent. |
|-----------|-----------|
| Kikuyu    | 19·5      |
| Luo       | 14·4      |
| Baluhya   | 12·5      |
| Kamba     | 11·7      |
| Meru      | 6·2       |
| Nyika     | 5·6       |

The 1948 census showed a total non-African population of 154,846 of whom 90,528 were Indians, 29,660 Europeans and 24,174 Arabs. The non-African population at the end of 1951 has been estimated at about 200,000.

Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Tsita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid.
but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Kulal 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,040 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,104). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30–40 miles wide and 2,000–3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa. The capital is Nairobi, altitude 5,500 feet and 320 miles from the sea.

The climate varies greatly. Three broad divisions exist:

1. The coast and its immediate hinterland;
2. The low plain, 300–2,000 feet, extending from the borders of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to the boundary of Tanganyika.
3. The Highlands, 3,000–10,000 feet.

The principal towns are:

- **Population at 1948 Census**
  - Nairobi (capital): 118,976
  - Mombasa: 84,746
  - Nakuru: 17,625
  - Kisumu: 10,899
  - Eldoret: 8,193
  - Kitale: 6,338
  - Nanyuki: 4,090

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1947 which supersedes the original agreement of 1908.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which a rent of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty’s Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan’s mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Under Additional Royal Instructions of 1951 and 1952 the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Chief Secretary and Member for Development, the Attorney-General and Member for Law and Order, the Financial Secretary and Member for Finance, the Chief Native Commissioner and Member for African Affairs, the Member for Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Deputy Chief Secretary and Member for Education and Labour, the Member for Health, Lands and Local Government, the Member for Commerce and Industry (all *ex-officio* members) and such other persons as the Governor may appoint, whether holding public office or not, who are styled “Appointed members” or appointed as temporary members, with the Governor as President. There are at present four such Appointed members, two being Europeans, one Asian and one African.

The Legislative Council of the Colony consists of the Governor, who is President, a Vice-President and Speaker, eight *ex-officio* members, 18 nominated members, 21 elected members and seven Representative members. The 21 elected members are: one Arab, 14 Europeans and six Indians. The Representative members are: one Arab and six Africans.

By the Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated...
at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Nyeri and various other places.

A General Election was held in 1952 for the constituencies established by the Legislative Council (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1951. This Ordinance defined the boundaries of the 14 European Electoral Areas, the four Indian non-Muslim Electoral Areas, the two Indian Muslim Electoral Areas and the one Arab Electoral Area. The six African Representative members were appointed from among the three names submitted by each of the electoral colleges set up in each of six areas of the Colony.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by non-African Local Authorities. There are now 26 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local legislation, regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. The Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, enables District Councils in the settled areas to prepare schemes for organizing the local government of their area into a County Council.

All land in Kenya falls into one of two categories:

(a) Crown lands.

(b) Native lands.

"Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

"Native lands" are permanently reserved for Africans in so far as the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of the land are concerned and all the rights enjoyed under native laws and custom are preserved.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township or native reserve, may be alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

The forms of direct taxation are: income tax, which applies to all members of the community; personal tax, which applies to Europeans and Asians; poll tax, which applies to Africans, and hospital tax contribution, which applies to Europeans. Under the Income Tax law generous personal allowances are given and the rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 1/50 in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases on a graduated scale to Shs. 11/- in the £ on incomes exceeding £50,000 per annum. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/- in the £. The maximum rate of the Personal Tax is £3 per annum and the amount of the Hospital Contribution is calculated on the amount of total income.

The other main forms of taxation are Customs and excise duties.

The following is a table of public finance in the Territory:

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

In the same year the main groups of expenditure were estimated at:

| Service                          | Expenditure (£) | Per cent. |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Services under the Member for Development | 2,434,890   | 14-9      |

| Services under the Member for Education, Health, and Local Government | 3,738,471   | 22-9      |

But at the end of 1952 actual revenue was estimated at £18,872,878 and actual expenditure at £17,570,000.

In addition to the expenditure mentioned above, £4,094,871 was spent by the Development and Reconstruction Authority in 1951.

The Public Debt of Kenya at the 31st December, 1951, was £20,191,091, made up as follows:

| Type of Debt                        | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| Funded Debt                         | 16,280,600 |
| (of which £6,696,061 was raised for the East African Railways and Harbours Administration.) |
| 2½% East African War Bonds          | 3,653,640  |
| Loans from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote | 256,851   |
| **Total**                           | **£20,191,091** |

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board in London. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note
issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-), and Shs. 1/- (notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

The programme of development and reconstruction adopted by the Government is based on the recommendations contained in the Development Committee's Report published in July 1946 as modified by the recommendations contained in the Report of the Planning Committee published in 1951. The total revised programme for 1946 to 1955 amounts to £35,489,500. The funds required for this programme are to be provided by:

- Colonial Development Welfare Vote (£ Colony's block allocation) £3,500,000
- Colonial Development and Welfare Vote (Inter-territorial and Central Research allocations) £855,000
- Loan Funds £18,500,000
- Kenya Revenue £12,634,500

The object of the programme is to use the natural resources of the country, including manpower, in a manner calculated to increase the national revenue, and so to raise the standard of living of the majority of the inhabitants, in the shortest space of time. The programme can be divided into the following parts:

| Part | Description                                      | £       | Percent |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| I    | Development of the Land                          | 11,419,400 | 32·1    |
| II   | Development of Communications                    | 7,117,000 | 20·1    |
| III  | Social Services                                  | 9,125,600 | 25·7    |
| IV   | Provision of facilities for Industry             | 300,000  | 0·9     |
| V    | General or Basic Developments                    | 7,527,500 | 21·2    |

**Development of the Land**

68·9% of the total allocation for this purpose will be spent on Agriculture and Veterinary Services and 24·9% on Water Development.

**Development of Communications**

78·6% of the total will be spent on Roads.

**Social Services**

21·1% of the total will be spent on Health and Hospital Services and 77·1% on Education.

**General or Basic Developments**

83% of the total is to be spent on Buildings.

The Colonial Development Corporation took over the operation of the Macalder Base Metal Mine, now renamed the "Macalder Nyanza Mines, Limited", in 1951 and production of copper concentrates has started. Soda ash ranked fifth in the list of the Colony's domestic exports. The production of kyanite and mullite continued to expand. New graphite and asbestos prospects showed promise and it is hoped that they will be developed on a commercial basis in the near future. Work on the Geological Survey continued and E.C.A. geologists reported that geological conditions in the Northern Province were not incompatible with the presence of oil.

Industrial development continued to make rapid progress. A new cigarette factory, two new flour mills, a brewery, a large brick and tile works, glassworks and a knitwear factory commenced to operate. An aluminium rolling mill, a cement factory, a factory for the manufacture of metal drums, a match factory, and a further brewery are nearing completion. Plans are under consideration for the setting up of a cotton textile mill and also factories for the manufacture of cotton blankets, bags from soft fibres, cement and mineral waters. The canning industry continues to make satisfactory progress. Proposals are under consideration for the establishment of an oil refinery at Mombasa.

Education services are as follows (1951 figures):

**African Education.**—There were 58 African Secondary Schools with 1,912 pupils. Of these 18 were Government schools with 611 pupils; 39 aided, with 1,292 pupils; and one unaided, with nine pupils. Primary and Intermediate Schools number 2,860 with an enrolment of 261,419 pupils. Of these, 138 were Government schools with 20,237 pupils; 1,208 were aided, with 115,171 pupils; and 1,514 were unaided, with 126,011 pupils. Among these schools were 56 Teacher-Training Centres with 1,156 students and three Technical and Trade Schools with 898 trainees. There was in addition one post-graduate Teacher-Training Centre with 31 students.

**Asian Education.**—There were 18 Secondary Schools with 4,584 pupils. Of these eight were Government schools with 3,496 pupils; nine aided, with 992 pupils; and one unaided, with 96 pupils. Primary Schools number 93 with an enrolment of 22,892 pupils. Of these, 16 were Government schools with 12,113 pupils; 68 aided, with 10,646 pupils; and nine unaided, with 133 pupils. There were also three Teacher-Training Centres with a total of 108 students.

**European Education.**—There were seven Secondary Schools with 1,744 pupils. Of these, three were Government with 1,239 pupils; one aided, with 154 pupils; and three unaided, with 351 pupils. Primary Schools numbered 32 with an enrolment of 4,845. Of these, 11 are Government with 2,817 pupils; three aided, with 247 pupils; and 18 unaided, with 1,781 pupils.

**Arab and other Races.**—There was one Government Secondary School with 102 pupils, 9 Government Primary Schools with 1,250 pupils and one aided school with 154 secondary and 465 primary pupils.

The only institute for higher education in East Africa at present is Makerere College in Uganda, and during 1951 there were 86 students from Kenya attending courses. At the end of 1951 there were in the United Kingdom 424 students (of whom 104 were scholars or bursars) comprising 193 Europeans, 195 Asians and Goans, five Arabs and 31 Africans. The most popular courses of study were Engineering, Medicine and the Bar. In South Africa a small proportion of Europeans took courses, mainly in Surveying and Forestry, and five Africans were known to be attending educational institutions during the year. India naturally attracts a large number of Asian students, but a marked preference is now being shown for training in the United Kingdom.
Twenty-seven Africans, of whom seven were Government of India or Shah scholars, studied in India during the year.

Total Government recurrent expenditure on education in 1951 was £1,378,540, compared with £170,000 in 1935.

Total expenditure by the Medical Department on health services in 1951 was £1,010,277, compared with £203,451 in 1935. In 1951 beds available in hospitals (including maternity homes) totalled 7,874 (Government 6,116, Local Authorities 175, Mission 1,174 and private 409). In-patients at Government Hospitals totalled 187,308 and out-patients 1,101,188.

Nairobi (Eastleigh) is the main aerodrome used by international services. Internal scheduled services operated by E.A.A.C. are based on Nairobi West and operate services in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Kenya and Zanzibar. A number of aircraft-operating companies are based at Nairobi West. Air Safety and Aeradio Services are provided by the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation and Meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. All air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the Air Transport Authority.

International schedules connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Aden, Ethiopia and Madagascar.

There are approximately 20,500 miles of road, varying in standard from good bitumen surfaced highways to tracks in the more remote areas which can be used only with difficulty by motor vehicles. The main roads, except during exceptional rains, are for the most part all-weather. They include part of the great North Road (Cape Town to Cairo) which passes through Kenya by way of Namanga on the Tanganyika border, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu and Busia on the Uganda border; the Mombasa–Nairobi road; the Mau Summit, Eldoret–Kitale road and the Nairobi–Nyeri–Nanyuki road.

(See also under “East Africa High Commission” for Railways and Harbours, Ports and Road, Marine and Air Services.)

A broadcast transmitting station is operated at Nairobi by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, programme material being provided by the Information Service. Broadcasts to Africans, in Kikuyu and Swahili, from a studio in the Press Office, are transmitted throughout Kenya. Transmitters have a power of 5 kw. Local broadcasts in Swahili and Arabic are also given from a studio in Mombasa. The Press Office owns and maintains some 230 wireless sets, the majority of which are loaned to African coffee-shop owners. A wired service is also provided in the King George VI Hospital, Nairobi, and the Nairobi Prison. There are at present about 15,500 licensed wireless receiving sets in use.

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. Many Africans in the Highlands also own forest plantations. The estimated numbers in employment in other occupations are shown in the following table:

| Race     | Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing | Mining and Quarrying | Building and Construction | Commerce | Transport | Manufactures | Other | Public Service (including Government) |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| European | 1,247                            | 81                   | 424                      | 1,938    | 530       | 1,279       | 406   | 3,587                               |
| Asian    | 503                              | 108                  | 2,093                    | 6,249    | 1,328     | 5,669       | 930   | 7,062                               |
| Africans | 203,158                          | 5,527                | 12,696                   | 16,981   | 7,799     | 38,319      | 34,575| 16,339                              |

In March, 1952, 13 employees’ and four employers’ unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total membership was 20,811.

The main crops and products are sisal, coffee, tea, wattle extract, cotton, maize, wheat and pyrethrum.

Beef production, dairying, sheep, pigs and poultry play an increasingly important rôle in the general agricultural policy of the Colony and considerable quantities of meat, butter, hides and skins, wool and bacon are produced annually.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony’s timber supplies—softwoods such as podo carpus and pencil cedar as well as the hardwoods East African olive and camphor. Thinnings from exotic softwood and hardwood plantations, the bamboo forests up-country and the mangrove forests at the coast, provide well over 2,000,000 poles per annum.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and on Lakes Victoria and Rudolf, etc., and apart from seasonal shortages, an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The chief minerals are gold, kyanite, mullite, diatomite and asbestos. The production of soda ash and salt is collectively of more value than that of gold. Kyanite and mullite have now, it is estimated, also equalled gold production in value. Other minerals worked are copper, lead and zinc; natural carbon dioxide gas of a high quality is also produced on a commercial scale. The total value of minerals won in 1951 was approximately £1,900,000.

There are some 80 main types of manufacturing and industrial activity, producing goods for local consumption and export. The main productions for export are aluminium holloware, bacon and pork products, base metals, boots and shoes, canned foodstuffs, cheese, cigarettes, diatomite products, dried milk, essential oil, gold, soda, hydrogenated oils, insecticides, kyanite and mullite, passion fruit juice and pulp, pyrites, pyrethrum extract, refractories, sisal products, tanned leather, wattle extract or bark, woollen blankets and textiles, pencil slats. Fancy leather goods and native curios are made by individual craftsmen for local consumption and export.
