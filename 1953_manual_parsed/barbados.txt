BARBADOS

Barbados is the most easterly of the Caribbean islands. Its total area is 166 square miles.

The population was estimated at 215,128 in 1951; the 1946 census gives the racial divisions as:

- African descent : 77.27%
- Mixed descent : 17.35%
- European descent : 5.11%

The Island is comparatively flat, rising in a series of tablelands marked by well-defined terraces to the highest point (1,104 feet) at Mount Hillaby. The north-east corner of the Island is the Scotland area which is broken country, much eroded and rather barren. The formation of the rest of the Island is coral limestone. There are no rivers, but deep gullies which fill with water during heavy rain have cut their way through the coral terraces in many places. Indigenous forest covers only 43 acres.

The climate is not excessively hot. North-easterly trade winds blow steadily from December to June but during the remainder of the year, the wet season, the wind moves to the south-east and is less strong, resulting in humid, hotter conditions. The average temperature is 79.8°. The rainfall is very varied: in the high central district the yearly average is 75 inches while in some of the low-lying coastal areas the average is 50 inches.

Bridgetown, the capital, is the only town. At the 1946 census its population was 68,924.

The Island was visited in 1625 by Sir Thomas Warner. The first settlement was made in 1627, by Sir William Courteen's men from the William and John, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough. The Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I for all the Caribbean islands and landed settlers in 1628. At his death in 1636 his son leased the Island for 21 years to Lord Willoughby of Parham who assumed the government of the Island and during the Civil War held it for the Royalists until his capitulation to the Cromwellian fleet in 1652. A Governor was appointed by the Commonwealth in place of Lord Willoughby and at the Restoration the claims of the Carlisle Patent were revived. An agreement was reached by which the Patent was surrendered to the Crown for compensation in the form of 4½% duty on exports. This duty was a continual source of complaint but was not abolished until 1838 by Act of Imperial Parliament. The importance of the agreement, however, is that it marked the end of proprietary rule. Since its settlement Barbados has been a possession of Great Britain.

The Charter of Barbados was ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1652. It provided, among other things, that the government of the Island should be vested in the Governor, Council and Assembly according to ancient and usual custom. At present the Island possesses a representative chamber of Legislature but not responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation. The Legislature consists of the Governor; the Legislative Council, consisting of 15 members appointed by Her Majesty; and a House of Assembly, consisting of 24 members, (two for each parish and two for the City of Bridgetown) elected for a period of three years by adult suffrage which was introduced in 1951. The registered number of voters was 96,000. The executive side of government is vested in the...
Governor and Executive Council, and, in most matters, in an Executive Committee. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary and the Attorney-General ex-officio and such other persons as Her Majesty may appoint. The Executive Committee which was formed in 1881 by Act of the Legislature consists of the Executive Council, one member of the Legislative Council and four members of the House of Assembly appointed by the Governor. Since 1946 it has been the custom for the Governor to appoint as House members the four members suggested by the leader of the political party most likely to command a majority in the House.

The Executive Committee introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates and initiates all Government measures; it is also responsible for the conduct of public works, and the control and management of Government property.

The systems of land tenure are similar to those of the United Kingdom.

Income tax is the main form of direct taxation. The tax rates range from 2½ cents on every complete $ of taxable income up to $480, to 75 cents on every complete $ of taxable income beyond $24,000. Tax is not paid on incomes below $720 per annum in the case of single individuals and $1,200 in the case of married persons. Deductions from taxable income of $240 are allowed for children or other dependants, in the latter case not exceeding two. Deductions are also permitted on life insurances. Companies pay a flat rate of 37½%. The rate for life assurance companies is the average paid by an individual with a taxable income of $4,800.

Estate and succession duties range from ¼% on estates not exceeding $2,400 to 2% on estates over $48,000. These percentages are the minimum and apply to a lineal descendant or ancestor.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariffs and excise duty on rum production.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony:

| Year    | Revenue     | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1938–39 | $2,535,734  | $2,622,115  |
| 1939–40 | $2,685,518  | $2,688,182  |
| 1945–46 | $7,341,810  | $5,494,322  |
| 1946–47 | $8,139,683  | $6,796,516  |
| 1947–48 | $9,246,782  | $8,284,443  |

* Revised Estimate.

It is estimated that in 1952–53 44% of revenue will be derived from Customs and excise and 43% from taxation.

The main heads of estimated expenditure for the same year are:

- Education: 17%
- Health: 11%
- Subsidies and Controls: 9%
- Highways: 7%

The Public Debt at the 31st of December, 1951, was $2,905,728, approximately $13·50 per head of population. It comprises:

- Public Loan Act, 1914, and Reimbursement Act, 1914: $177,600
- General Local Loan Act, 1933, and Public Loans (Redemption) Act, 1933: $676,416
- Waterworks Loan Act, 1935: $746,400
- Education Loan Act, 1935: $397,872
- Waterworks Loan Act, 1941: $169,920
- Local Loan Act, 1941: $326,400
- Public Loans (Redemption) Act, 1942: $411,120

The currency in circulation is a West Indian currency issued by the Board of the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern group) consisting of Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. Currency notes are of denominations $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100. British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. The West Indian $ is fixed at 4s. 2d., that is $4·80 to £1 sterling.

In 1946 a Ten-Year Development Plan covering the years 1946–56 was framed. The Plan envisaged expenditure of some £3,412,000 over the ten-year period; of this amount £800,000 represented the Colony’s allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. The Plan has been followed in the broader aspects, if not in detail, and extensive work has been carried out under the main headings of Education (school buildings), Housing, Water Supply and Roads. A revised programme of capital development to cover the years 1952–57 is now under consideration.

Free, but not compulsory, elementary education is provided by the Government. There are 124 public elementary schools. In 1951, there were 30,080 pupils (15,357 boys and 14,723 girls) with an average attendance of 22,127 (10,992 boys and 11,135 girls). There are 11 government-aided Secondary Schools, three first grade and eight second grade. The first grade schools with an attendance of 1,231 (870 boys and 361 girls) are Harrison College (boys), the Lodge School (boys) and Queen’s College (girls). The other eight Secondary Schools—four boys’, three girls’ and one co-educational—had an attendance of 1,607 pupils (1,001 boys and 606 girls). In addition there are 12 private schools that have agreed to inspection by the Department of Education.

There are annually five Barbados scholarships to United Kingdom or Canadian Universities, two exhibitions tenable at the University College of the West Indies, and two Island scholarships tenable at Codrington College. A Teachers’ Training College trains 16 male and 16 female teachers annually. Codrington College, founded in 1710 and affiliated to Durham University, functions mainly as a theological college but accepts a few students reading for classics. There were 28 students in residence during 1951.

Adult education is provided by the Barbados Evening Institute for 1,504 students in academic, commercial and technical subjects, and the Board of Industrial Training awards 48 bursaries to suitable applicants for training under apprenticeship schemes with master workmen.

Expenditure on education services in 1951–52 was £374,792 compared with £56,113 in 1935–36.

The Barbados General Hospital has accommodation for 30 paying patients and 256 non-paying
patients. The Government maintains a mental hospital with accommodation for 248 males and 326 females and a leper hospital at which there are 34 patients. For the training of midwives the Government Maternity Hospital has accommodation for 20 expectant mothers. Each of the 11 parishes has an almshouse for the care of the destitute sick and for the housing of the aged and poor. These almshouses are on the medical side in the nature of cottage hospitals.

Expenditure on health services in 1951-52 was £255,802, compared with £43,098 in 1935-36.

The airfield is at Seawell, about 12 miles from Bridgetown. The main airlines operating are the British West Indian Airways, linking with most of the other British West Indian Islands, Trans-Canada Airlines and British Guiana Airways. Barbados is the headquarters of the Director-General of Civil Aviation in the West Indies.

There are 608 miles of road open to traffic, of which 458 are oil-emulsion surfaced.

Bridgetown is the only port of entry, although some loading of sugar takes place at Speightstown and oil is pumped ashore at Spring Gardens.

The main shipping companies visiting Barbados are Harrison Line, Elder and Fyffes Line, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa Steamship Company, Saguenay Terminals. Occasionally ships of Furness Withy, Moore McCormack, Blue Star, Lamport and Holt and Booth Lines visit port.

A wired broadcasting system, confined to Bridgetown and the suburbs, is operated by a local company—Barbados Rediffusion Service Limited. It has 5,188 subscribers.

Most of the population is engaged in the cultivation of the sugar crop and auxiliary occupations connected with the sugar industry. The 1946 census gives 25,245 persons engaged in agriculture, 14,226 in domestic service, 10,373 in the retail trade, and 7,801 in construction work.

There are seven trade unions with some 17,500 members.

Almost every available acre is given over to the cultivation of the sugar cane, and Barbados is one of the most intensively cultivated parts of the world. The output of sugar during 1951 was the largest ever produced in the Island, being 29,460 tons in excess of the previous record of 1950. The production was the equivalent of 187,643 tons. 186 acres of cotton were reaped with a yield of 58,225 lb. of seed cotton; 15,245 lb. of lint were obtained. 1,775,624 proof wine gallons of rum were distilled in 1951.
