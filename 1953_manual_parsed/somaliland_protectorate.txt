SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE

The area of the Protectorate, which extends along part of the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden, is 68,000 square miles.

No complete census has yet been possible but the mainly nomadic Somali population is estimated to be 640,000. There are a small number of Arab and Indian traders, and a few European representatives of commercial firms based on Aden.

The country consists of four main features—the coastal plain, the maritime plain (both known as the Guban), the escarpment, rising in parts to 6,000 and 7,000 feet (the Golis), and a gently sloping plain or plateau to the south (the Ogo). The Haad, the empty waterless plains, the greater part of which lie to the south of the Protectorate frontier, constitute the principal pastures of the country.

Except for the intense heat of the coast and an irritating dust-laden wind during the south-west monsoon from May to September, the climate is healthy and pleasant.

The temperature varies from 70°-108° in the coastal areas, and in the highlands from occasional slight local frosts (32°) to between 80° and 99°. The rainfall varies from an average of 2 inches at Berbera on the coast, to 5 inches at Burao and 15 inches at Hargeisa.

The capital is Hargeisa—population about 20,000; Burao has about 4,000, Berbera, the principal port, about 7,500. The population of these towns varies considerably at different times of the year.

When the Egyptian garrisons were withdrawn in 1884 a British Protectorate was established
over the tribes on the Somaliland coast from Zeila to Berbera. By 1887 a series of treaties guaranteeing British protection had been concluded with various Somali tribes and in the following year the limits of the British and French spheres of influence were defined. The other inland boundaries of the Protectorate were defined by agreements with Italy in 1894 and Ethiopia in 1897.

Until 1898 the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the Foreign Office and in 1905 to the Colonial Office.

From 1901 until 1920 the Government was engaged in sporadic operations against the Mullah, Mohamed Abdulla Hassan. In 1910 the Government withdrew to the coast for three years but it was not until 1920 that the Mullah’s power was finally broken.

In August 1940 Italian Forces from Ethiopia invaded and occupied the Protectorate but in March 1941 the British Forces drove out the Italians and a Military Government was established. The Protectorate remained under military administration until 1948 when the Civil Government was reconstituted.

The constitution is based on the Somaliland Order in Council, 1929. There is no Executive or Legislative Council and the power to make Ordinances is vested in the Governor. A Protectorate Advisory Council, consisting both of elected and of selected Somali representatives of all sections of the people, was established in 1947; there is also a non-statutory Governor’s Council of official members.

Government recognizes, or grants, individual title to land only in the towns. Apart from a small number of old freehold and waqf* titles, land in the towns is held on lease from the Government. Outside the towns there is no alienation of land.

The principal form of taxation is indirect, i.e. Customs import and export duties, which in the financial year 1951–52 yielded 72·6% of the total ordinary revenue. There is no direct taxation other than a house tax payable by owners or occupiers of property, which is assessed at 10% of the annual rental value of the property. In addition, a municipal sales tax, or octroi, exists on certain commodities, e.g. livestock and cereals brought for sale into specific townships.

The following is a table of public finance in the Protectorate.

| Year       | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

| 1952/53(d) (approved estimates) | 628,225 | 1,227,652 |

(a) Period 1st July–14th November, 1948, only.
(b) Period 15th November, 1948–31st March, 1949, only.
(c) Financial year is 1st April to 31st March.

(d) Includes revenue and expenditure in respect of Colonial Development and Welfare grants.
(e) Includes revenue and expenditure from Currency Conversion Loan; £102,750 and £113,290 respectively.

Note.—During the period of Military Administration (April 1941 to 15th November, 1948) the financial year ran from the 1st July to the 30th June.

The territory receives a deficit grant-in-aid from the United Kingdom Government which in 1951–52 amounted to £567,000.

It was estimated that in 1952–53 some 76% of the entire local revenue would be derived from Customs duties. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were estimated at:

- Social services: 12·1%
- Administration: 13·2%
- Public Works: 26·8%
- Development: 15·9%

There is no Public Debt of the Protectorate apart from the liability to repay loans-in-aid amounting to £236,000 received from the United Kingdom Government during the years 1921–34 should circumstances permit.

The currency in circulation is the East African currency issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The rupee currency of India, which was legal tender until 31st October, 1951, was withdrawn in that year. The East African currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

The Protectorate received an allocation of £839,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts (1940 and 1945). The territory, being substantially grant-aided, cannot provide additional development funds from its own resources or by raising loans. Of the £839,000 mentioned above £163,199 was expended, largely during the period of military administration, on a “General Development” programme embracing a wide variety of minor basic services, social services and productive services. The balance of £675,801 is distributed as follows:

- Basic Services: £182,567 (27%)
- Social Services: £161,332 (24%)
- Productive Services: £285,729 (42%)
- Reserve: £46,173 (7%)

**Basic Services**

Twenty-nine per cent. of the total will be spent on roads, 18·5% on buildings, 30·5% on a general economic survey and 22% on port development.

**Social Services**

Fifty-nine per cent. of the total will be spent on educational services and 40% on medical services.

**Productive Services**

Forty-two per cent. of the total will be spent on animal husbandry, the territory’s chief productive industry, and 27% on food production schemes.

The Colonial Development Corporation recently carried out an investigation into the possibilities of a camel abattoir but the project has been abandoned. There has been a recent revival of interest in oil exploration by various oil companies.

Expenditure on education in 1935–36 was £500. The estimate for 1952–53 is nearly £50,000. Before the war, Government’s contribution to education was confined to the payment of small grants to Koranic schools and to the provision of a few scholarships for schooling in Aden or the Sudan. There are now 38 grant-aided private

or Koranic schools (1,200 pupils in 1951), nine Elementary schools (639 pupils in 1951), two Middle or Intermediate schools (274 pupils in 1951). Twenty-seven boys are maintained in Secondary schools outside the Protectorate and a small number of Somalis have been sent for further education in the United Kingdom. A boys' Junior Secondary school, a boarding school for girls and a trades school are nearing completion. There are small kindergarten schools for European and Indian children.

Expenditure on medical and health services in 1935-36 was £11,000. The estimate for 1952-53 is £94,000.

There are hospitals in each of the Administrative Districts, and a central hospital at Hargeisa with a total capacity of 600 beds. Hospital admissions rose from 8,642 in 1950 to 12,884 in 1951. Out-patients increased from 88,496 to 108,867 in the same period. There are also dispensaries in a number of the interior villages and the Protectorate now has a portable X-ray unit for radiological work. The principal diseases are tuberculosis and other chest complaints, seasonal malaria and eye troubles.

Regular air services are maintained by Aden Airways between Hargeisa, Berbera and Aden, and with East Africa. There are no internal services nor railways.

There are approximately 3,000 miles of gravel or earth roads.

An irregular weekly steamer service operates between Aden and Berbera. Other sea communications are maintained by dhow. The Brocklebank Line maintains a monthly service from the United Kingdom to Berbera during the months October to April.

The Government Information Office maintains a broadcasting station known as Radio Somali, which transmits on a wavelength of 7.125 mc/s for an hour a day. Receiving sets are installed in schools and community centres throughout the Protectorate.

Government service and public works provide, in effect, the only source of local employment and numbers of Somali emigrate in search of work. The large majority of the people are nomads with camels, sheep and goats. The growing of crops, though still on a small scale, is increasing.

The main crops and products are millet, hides, skins, gums and guano. A rough estimate of the livestock population is: camels 1,200,000, sheep 2,355,000, goats 1,645,000. There are also some cattle and horses.
