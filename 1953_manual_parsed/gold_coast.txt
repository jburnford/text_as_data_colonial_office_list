THE GOLD COAST

The total area is 91,843 square miles (Colony 23,937, Ashanti 24,379, Northern Territories Protectorate 30,486, Trust Territory of Togoland 13,041 square miles).

At the 1948 census the population was:

|                | African | Non-African |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Gold Coast     | 4,111,680 | 6,770       |
| Colony         | 2,217,416 | 5,394       |
| Ashanti        | 817,782   | 1,162       |
| Northern Territories | 1,076,482 | 214         |

The part of Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship (included in the above) 382,717 51

The total population of the Gold Coast in mid-1952 was estimated at 4,399,000.

The Gold Coast is divided into three main zones:

(i) A narrow belt of plains and scrubland, 5–50 miles wide and following the coastline. It includes the Accra Plains and is intersected by rivers and streams. Only three rivers have permanently open mouths, guarded by shallow river bars.

(ii) A belt of tropical rain-forest extends northwards from the coast, near the western frontier, for some 170 miles. The area is broken by ranges of heavily-wooded hills, some of which rise from 600–2,000 feet, and is intersected by numerous rivers and streams navigable only by canoes. This area produces most of the timber, cocoa and minerals which play an important part in the economy of the Gold Coast.

(iii) North of the forest belt the country undulates gently between 300–1,300 feet, and is mostly covered by orchard bush with park-like areas and stretches of treeless plains. A range of hills runs north and south along the eastern boundary reaching a maximum height of 2,900 feet.

Except in the north, there are two rainy seasons in the year, separated by a short comparatively dry spell in July and August and a longer dry season from December to February. During the rainy seasons the well-known West African squalls normally occur. In the Northern Territories the two rainy seasons tend to merge into one to the exclusion of the short dry spell. The longer dry season is correspondingly extended.

Dry north-easterly winds (the Harmattan) reach the Gold Coast in January and February. They frequently bring particles of fine dust from the deserts in the north and cause a haze, which may become so thick as to impede navigation on the sea and in the air.

There are four fairly distinct climatic regions, namely the eastern coastal belt—warm and fairly dry; the south-west corner—warm and very humid; the forest belt—warm and humid; and the north—hot and dry:

| Zone               | Station | Mean Rainfall | Mean Max. Temp. °F. | Absolute Max. Temp. °F. |
|--------------------|---------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Eastern Coastal Belt | Accra   | 29 ins.       | 86                  | 94                    |
| South-west Corner  | Axim    | 83 ins.       | 85                  | 92                    |
| Forest Belt        | Kumasi  | 58 ins.       | 86                  | 96                    |
| North              | Tamale  | 43 ins.       | 92                  | 106                   |

In December and January the hot days in the Northern Territories are associated with very cool nights. The averages of minimum and maximum temperatures for these months show a diurnal range of 29°. During these months daytime humidity may fall to less than 20%.

The principal towns are:

The Gold Coast first became known through Portuguese navigators, who visited the district in 1471 in their search for gold, ivory and spices. They built a chain of forts and castles along the Coast and these served as their trading posts. The slave trade later attracted the attention of traders of other European nations, notably the English and the Dutch; and in 1642 the Portuguese were compelled to abandon their possessions to the newcomers. By 1750, all the other European nations had relinquished their settlements on the Coast with the exception of the English, the Dutch and the Danes, who had their headquarters at Cape Coast, Elmina and Christiansborg respectively.

In 1821 the Imperial Government assumed full control of the British Settlements on the Coast; and by a convention made in 1871 the Dutch, who then remained the only other European nation on the Gold Coast, ceded their settlements to the British.

The Colony of the Gold Coast was created by Charter in July 1874, and in August of the same year an Order in Council empowered the Legislative Council to legislate for the new Colony by ordinance. Even then the Colony did not include all the areas under British protection as the boundaries remained undefined. To regularize the position, therefore, these protected areas were annexed as a British possession in 1901 and the boundaries of the Colony were fully defined by Order in Council in 1906.

In the interim the eighteenth century saw the rise of the formidable confederacy of the Ashantis, who soon began to demand a larger and a more
direct share of the trade with the Europeans. As could be expected, the Coastal peoples resisted their demands, and this led to a continuous struggle. Eventually, in the nineteenth century, the Ashantis came into open conflict with the English, who tried to protect the Coastal peoples. In 1874, after a series of Ashanti wars, Sir Garnet Wolseley led a campaign against Kumasi, the stronghold of the Ashantis. The town was sacked; Prempeh, the King, was deposed and exiled to St. Helena. Ashanti was annexed to the British Crown in 1901 and Prempeh was only allowed to return in 1924. The Ashanti Confederacy was restored in 1935 and Prempeh's successor was proclaimed Asantehene, the Ashanti title for the head of the Ashanti nation.

The Northern Territories came under British rule after the conclusion of treaties with the Chiefs in 1897.

In 1922 a portion of the adjoining German territory of Togoland was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as a part of the Gold Coast. This strip of land became a Trusteeship Territory after the formation of the United Nations Organization.

The present constitution came into effect on 1st January, 1951. The Executive Council, or Cabinet as it is now more usually called, consists of the Governor as President; three ex-officio members, namely the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary; and not less than eight representative members, who are members of the Legislative Assembly proposed by the Governor, after consultation with the Prime Minister, and approved by the Assembly.

The Prime Minister is appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of the Assembly. In the absence of the Governor the Prime Minister presides at meetings of the Cabinet.

The Governor at his discretion may charge any ex-officio Member of the Cabinet with the responsibility for Government Departments, and may similarly charge any Representative Member after consultation with the Prime Minister. Members of the Cabinet are known as Ministers. There is provision for Ministerial Secretaries to be appointed from among members of the Legislative Assembly and for a Permanent Secretary in each Ministry, who is a public officer appointed by the Governor.

The Legislative Assembly legislates for all the Territories of the Gold Coast. It consists of a Speaker, three ex-officio members, namely the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary, three special members who represent the commercial interests—of whom only one is permitted to vote—and three special members who represent mining interests—also with only one vote. The 75 elected members consist of 33 rural members, five municipal members, eleven territorial members elected by the Joint Provincial Council, six territorial members elected by the Asanteman Council, 19 territorial members elected by an electoral college for the Northern Territories formed out of the Northern Territories Territorial Council, and one territorial member elected by the Southern Togoland Council.

The rural members represent constituencies whose boundaries were laid down in the Elections Ordinance, 1950, made under a special Order in Council for the purpose. This Ordinance also laid down an electoral procedure, of which the main provision is that elections in rural constituencies should take place by secret ballot in two stages. In the first stage primary elections are held to choose representatives for local electoral colleges, which in the second stage choose one, or in certain cases two, representatives for each constituency. In order to qualify for registration to vote or for nomination as a candidate, an individual man or woman must be aged 21, a British subject and have a residential qualification of a minimum of six months. Literacy is not imposed as a qualification except in the case of candidates for the secondary elections.

The four municipalities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and Cape Coast are represented by the urban members who are elected by direct election.

In the Colony and Ashanti the land is owned by Stools*, families or individuals, except such as has been acquired by the Crown, mainly for public purposes. Grants by natives, other than customary grants, are subject to the provisions of the Concessions Ordinance, 1939, and subsidiary legislation made thereunder. In the Northern Territories the control of all land is vested in the Governor and all minerals are vested in the Crown. The vesting of rights in land in non-natives is therefore controlled by the Government. In Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, the law applicable to the Colony applies to the Southern Section, and the law applicable to the Northern Territories, to the Northern Section. In addition it is unlawful for any native without the consent of the Governor to alienate any interest in land to a non-native.

Income tax is levied on individuals, and on bodies of persons other than companies, on a graduated scale rising from 3d. in every £ of the first £200 of chargeable income to 11s. 6d. for every £ exceeding £10,000. The rate of tax upon companies is 9s. in the £, with relief for small companies incorporated locally during their first six years and for companies formally admitted as pioneer enterprises. Minerals duty is imposed upon the value of minerals won at rates varying with the profitability of the undertaking. Persons other than companies are exempt from this tax if they are engaged in winning diamonds or small quantities of gold only.

The following is a table of public finance in the Territory:

| Year    | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| 1937–38 | 3,791,673   | 3,636,569      |
| 1938–39 | 3,780,288   | 3,489,346      |
| 1946–47 | 7,567,589   | 6,630,140      |
| 1947–48 | 10,245,618  | 10,965,604     |
| 1948–49 | 11,639,324  | 11,487,703     |

† Approved Estimates.

During the year 1951–52 69·7% of the revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 17·2% from direct taxes.

The Public Debt at the end of March 1952 amounted to £10,710,000 (approximately £2 9s. per head of population) comprising:

- **Gold Coast 4½% Inscribed Stock, 1956**: £4,628,000
- **Gold Coast 4½% Inscribed Stock, 1960-70**: £1,170,000
- **Gold Coast 3% Concession Stock, 1954-59**: £602,000
- **Gold Coast 3% Inscribed Stock, 1963**: £2,010,000
- **Loan from Cocoa Marketing Board**: £2,300,000

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African Territories. It consists of notes of 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d., ¼d. and tenth penny. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par. The estimated total currency outstanding in the Gold Coast at the end of September 1952 amounted to about £30,500,000.

The Gold Coast Development Plan, which was approved by the Legislative Assembly in 1951, for commencement with effect from the 1st April, 1951, provides for a total expenditure of approximately £77 million, to be spent in the following proportions:

| Service                  | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Economic and Productive Services | 20         |
| Communications           | 30         |
| Social Services          | 33         |
| Common Services          | 17         |

No definite period is laid down for the completion of the Plan as a whole, but it is hoped that it will be possible to spend approximately £53 million in the five years 1951-56, in addition to development expenditure by the Railway Administration from loan funds. The approximate estimated expenditure under some of the more important heads during this period will be as follows:

- **Roads**: £10,400,000
- **Education**: £9,000,000
- **Medical**: £4,000,000
- **Housing**: £4,000,000
- **Officers’, Staff Quarters, etc.**: £3,800,000

Grants of approximately £4,000,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and £500,000 from the Mutual Security Agency are being received. The Plan is kept under constant review by the Standing Development Committee of the Cabinet.

Outside the scope of the Development Plan the two main items are the Volta River Project and the construction of a new modern port at Tema, about 17 miles from Accra. The former is a multiple development scheme involving the harnessing of the River Volta for the production of cheap hydro-electric power; the exploitation of the extensive bauxite deposits for the production of aluminium; the construction of the necessary roads and railways to carry the bauxite to the smelter and the aluminium to the port; and possibly the provision of a country-wide electrical grid and the irrigation of the Accra Plains. The aluminium production would be in the hands of private enterprise while the power project would be publicly owned. The scheme is still in the planning stage but a great deal of investigation has already been carried out. The total expenditure, including the cost of public works, is estimated at about £124 million.

The Gold Coast is inadequately provided with port facilities, particularly on the eastern seaboard. The construction of a new harbour near Accra, with road and rail links to the existing network, was begun in 1952. The first phase, involving the provision of four deep water berths, is estimated to cost over £10 million and will meet the needs of the aluminium industry when required, in addition to normal traffic.

In December 1951 there were in the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories, excluding Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, 2,733 Primary and Middle schools with an enrolment of 271,884 (202,739 boys and 69,145 girls) and 57 Secondary schools with an enrolment of 6,707 (5,938 boys and 769 girls). Post-primary technical institutions had an enrolment of 560 (504 boys and 56 girls) and 1,662 students were in teacher-training colleges (1,141 men and 521 women). The University College of the Gold Coast had 304 students (293 men and 11 women) studying in the faculties of Arts, Divinity, Economics and Science and 339 students were enrolled at the Institute of Education (223 men and 116 women) taking Diploma and Associateship Courses. There is a College of Technology at Kumasi, with an enrolment of over 200. In addition to the teacher-training department of the College, courses are available in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, and in pharmacy, accountancy and secretarial studies.

Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship had at the same date 340 Primary and Middle schools with an enrolment of 28,821 (20,397 boys and 8,424 girls); there were seven Secondary schools with an enrolment of 139 (138 boys and one girl). Two teacher-training colleges had between them 165 students (126 men and 39 women).

Students of the Gold Coast and Togoland studying abroad numbered 624 in the United Kingdom (308 of whom held Government scholarships) and 106 in the United States of America. Four students from Togoland were studying in France. In 1952 a further 198 scholarships were awarded for study in the United Kingdom, 25 in the United States and 200 at the University College of the Gold Coast and Kumasi College of Technology.

In June 1952 the first mass literacy campaign was launched in the Ashanti, Fante and Trans-Volta language areas. By the end of September there had been over 75,000 registered learners in literacy classes with over 7,000 voluntary class leaders, and examinations for literacy certificates were in progress.

Estimated expenditure on education in the financial year 1952-53 is £2,980,040, compared with £176,667 in 1935-36.

The principal diseases treated in 1951 included malaria, pneumonia, helminthic diseases, rheumatic conditions, affections of the respiratory system, nutritional diseases, skin diseases, diseases of the eye and annexa, and diseases of the digestive system. There are four central hospitals (Government) with specialist facilities, in addition to 27 Government, 11 Mines, 3 Mission and 10 private hospitals with a total of 2,448 beds and 355 cots. The number of beds is distributed as follows:—Government 1,670, Mines 462, Mission 138, Private 177. These hospitals are supplemented by 18 Government and 130 non-Government dressing stations in rural areas. Three Government health centres are nearing
completion. In 1951 there were 68,854 in-patients and 738,586 out-patients in the Government hospitals alone.

There are three Schools of Hygiene (Accra, Tamale and Kintampo) for the training of Sanitary Inspectors and Superintendents. The Medical Field Units (ten in 1951) make surveys and initiate mass treatment of trypanosomiasis and yaws, and undertake enquiries into the incidence of other endemic diseases, such as guinea-worm, bilharzia, onchocerciasis, leprosy, malaria, etc.

Estimated expenditure on medical and health services for 1952-53 is £2,074,710, including £594,650 estimated for new (development) projects. This figure may be compared with £298,810 in 1935-36.

The four aerodromes are at Accra, Takoradi, Kumasi and Tamale. Accra is an international airport and the terminus for the B.O.A.C. trunk route from the United Kingdom. Other airlines using Accra are Pan American World Airways (New York-Johannesburg), Air France (French West Africa), Transportes Aereos Portugueses (Lisbon-Portuguese West African territory) and West African Airways Corporation. The aerodromes at Takoradi, Kumasi and Tamale are used by the latter on their internal services and connect the Northern Territories, Ashanti and the Western Province to the capital.

Fully-staffed meteorological stations are maintained at all the airfields. The Forecast Centre at Accra airport maintains Flight Meteorological Watch over the Accra Flight Information Region and provides all forecasts for aviation and local use.

The total railway mileage open to traffic on 31st March, 1952, was 535 and the track mileage was 643. The main line runs from Takoradi to Kumasi, thence to Accra, a distance of 357 miles; with branches: Takoradi Junction to Sekondi (3 miles), Tarkwa to Prestea (18 miles), Aboso to Cinnamon Bippo (4 miles), Huni Valley to Kade (99 miles Central Province line) and Dunkwa to Awaso (46 miles). The main line and branches are 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. 5,650,313 passengers were carried during the financial year 1951-52 and 1,876,692 tons of freight. Proposals are in hand to link up the Central Province line from Achiasi to Kotoku on the Accra-Kumasi Line. To extend the railway from Awaso into Western Ashanti, from Achimota to the new harbour at Tema, a new railway is under construction.

There are 3,685 miles of road: bituminous surface 894 miles; gravel or earth surface 2,791 miles.

The chief port is Takoradi; there are smaller "surf" ports at Accra, Winneba, Cape Coast and Keta. During 1951 6,636,000 tons of shipping entered and cleared at all ports, of which 5,388,000 tons were handled at Takoradi.

A new harbour for ocean-going ships is under construction at Tema, 17 miles east of Accra. Four berths will be provided initially.

Mail and steamship services between the United Kingdom and the Gold Coast are maintained by Messrs. Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, the United Africa Company, Limited, and John Holt and Company, Limited.

The River Volta is navigable for light draught launches as far as Akuse and, with the exception of the Krachi rapids, can be used for canoe traffic during certain seasons of the year as far as Yeji. The Ankobra River is navigable for many months of the year by surf boats and light draught launches for a distance of 50 miles. The Tano, connected with Half Assini by the main lagoon, is navigable for light draught launches and canoes as far as Tanoso, a distance of about 60 miles.

The Government broadcasting service operates from Accra on two transmitters rated respectively at 1·3 kw. and 5 kw. There are 4,300 licence-holders. The Government wire broadcasting service serves nearly 12,000 subscribers in 23 towns throughout the Colony.

A large proportion of the population is engaged in agriculture, primarily cocoa and subsistence farming. Returns rendered by employers which, however, cover only a part of the working population, showed the numbers in the main occupations on 31st December, 1951, to be: agriculture, forestry and fishing, 28,897; mining and quarrying, 44,335; manufacturing, 11,273; construction, 41,814; electricity, gas, water and sanitary services, 4,910; commerce, 24,010; transport, storage, communication, 19,098; services, 43,328. Of the total of these figures, employment in the Central Government accounted for 75,213.

Eighty-eight trade unions had been registered by 31st March, 1952, by which date 58 registered unions had submitted returns showing a total of 32,908 paid-up members.

The main crops are cocoa, millet, maize, guinea-corn, plantain, yams, cassava, cocoyam, groundnuts and rice.

The livestock population is: cattle 392,000; sheep 376,053; goats 317,539; pigs 25,338; poultry 2,570,529; horses 6,207; donkeys 16,814.

Timber exports in 1951 totalled over 7,100,000 cubic feet of logs and over 2,600,000 cubic feet of lumber.

Large numbers of canoe fishermen work all along the coast. Their total catch in a normal year is of some 20,000 tons, the fish chiefly contributing to it being Sardinella species and Caranx species. The demand for fish throughout the Gold Coast is so keen that a much greater catch would be readily absorbed.

Gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite are mined.

The chief imports are cotton piece goods, iron and steel manufactures, machinery of all kinds, petroleum oils, motor vehicles, artificial silk piece goods, cement, alcoholic liquors, apparel of all kinds, wheat flour, fish, meats of all kinds, sugar, medicines and drugs.

There are two Marketing Boards, one dealing with cocoa and the other to handle scheduled agricultural produce. The produce at present on the schedule consists of oil palm produce, copra and coconut oil, shea nuts and shea butter, and coffee. These Boards ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to the producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, pay a reasonable remuneration to buying agents, spend money on research, and finance schemes for the benefit of the people in the producing areas. World prices for these products are high at present; but both Boards have stabilization funds which would supplement the price to the producer should world prices decline.

On the 31st March, 1951, there were 346 primary co-operative societies with 29,440 members and working capital of £200,119. Savings and deposits amounted to £55,861, and the Reserve Fund was £61,972.
