**THE WINDWARD ISLANDS**

The total area of the Islands is 821 square miles.

At the end of 1951 the total population was estimated at 286,129. The majority are of the negro race; less than 5% are white. There are a few persons of East Indian descent, and a few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica.

The islands are of volcanic origin and the more sheltered coasts are fringed by reefs. Torrential streams from the more rugged areas tend to lose their gradient nearer the coast and the deposition of their sediments has led to the formation of fertile river flats and occasional river terraces. The residual clays on the rugged volcanic areas are comparatively fertile. One of the volcanoes in the Windward region (St. Vincent) was active in 1902. At the Soufrières of Dominica and St.
Lucia and in parts of Grenada hot sulphuretted gases still emerge and there are numerous hot springs which contain salts.

The prevailing trade winds provide a delightful climate. There is little variation between night and day.

The capitals of the four colonies are:

- **Grenada**—St. George's (residence of Governor) . . . 5,772 (1946 census)
- **Dominica**—Roseau . . . 9,752 (1946 census)
- **St. Lucia**—Castries . . . 18,000 (1952 estimate)
- **St. Vincent**—Kingstown . . . 4,833 (1946 census)

As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government. On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad. On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

Each of the four colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada, where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Windward Islands. The government of each colony is administered by a resident Administrator subject to instructions from the Governor. There is no common Legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. Each colony has a Legislative Council presided over by the Administrator, in which the majority of members are elected by universal adult suffrage; and each colony has an Executive Council which may be summoned and consulted by either the Governor or the Administrator. A Court of Appeal for the West Indies consisting of the Chief Justices of the several West Indies Islands except Jamaica was set up in 1920 and a Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established in 1939. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889. In 1951 revised constitutions were introduced in each of the four islands.

There is a small amount of Crown land reserved mainly for purposes of forest and water conservation. There is no restriction on the transfer of land except to aliens, for which the consent of the Governor in Executive Council is necessary.

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. The other main forms of taxation are trade tariffs and excise duties. Some of the major crops are subject to an export tax.

The currency comprises dollar notes ($1 = 4s. 2d.) and British coinage. Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, and Trinidad) in currency unification. Trinidad Government notes continue as legal tender, but are being withdrawn and the Banks' powers of note issue have been terminated. Legislative provision has been made for eventual unification of coin in the Eastern Caribbean including the Windwards.

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 the Windward Islands received an allocation of £1,850,000. This was sub-allocated to the various colonies as follows:

| Colony     | Allocation (£) |
|------------|----------------|
| Grenada    | 381,890        |
| St. Vincent| 345,858        |
| St. Lucia  | 374,632        |
| Dominica   | 339,120        |

A sum of £408,500 was reserved by the Governor for schemes covering more than one territory and for unforeseen contingencies.

University education is provided at the University College of the West Indies in Jamaica. In the 1950-51 session there were 12 students from the Windward Islands. There are also a number of Windward Islands' students at universities in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.

The principal diseases are malaria, enteric fever, helminthic diseases, yaws, venereal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis and dysentery.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, in co-operation with the World Health Organization, have made grants towards the implementation of insect control programmes in St. Lucia and Grenada.

Airfields have been constructed in Grenada and St. Lucia, and these two colonies are served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule. A temporary service with Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft is operated by the St. Vincent Government between Trinidad, Grenada, Carriacou, Barbados, St. Vincent and Dominica.

A Colonial Development and Welfare grant has recently been approved to meet the capital and part of the recurrent costs of a broadcasting station in Grenada to serve the Windward Islands. The station will have a power of 5 kw.

### DOMINICA

The area is 304 square miles, and the 1951 mid-year estimate of population was 55,000.

Dominica is mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island.
The climate on the whole is good. During the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

Dominica was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, on his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded by the English and the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the British garrison. In 1783 it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

The present constitution was introduced on 29th September, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex-officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex-officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

The main heads of taxation are income tax, land and house tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 2d. to 10s. in the £ of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 6s. on every £ of chargeable income. Land and house tax is assessed at 1% of the value of properties and is payable twice a year in Roseau, once a year in Portsmouth. Ad valorem duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 10% to 20% preferential and 15% to 30% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars and black leaf tobacco.

The following is a table of public finance:

| Year | Revenue ($000 B.W.I.) | Expenditure ($000 B.W.I.) |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1938 | 354                   | 356                      |
| 1939 | 377                   | 380                      |
| 1946 | 1,456                 | 1,265                    |
| 1947 | 1,055                 | 958                      |
| 1948 | 856                   | 958                      |
| 1949 | 1,307                 | 1,396                    |
| 1950 | 1,604                 | 1,684                    |
| 1951 | 2,043                 | 2,048                    |

It was estimated that in 1951, 32% of revenue was derived from Customs and 38% from other local revenue.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Social services 19%, Public works 10% and Development 29%. Prior to 1940 Governor, Legislature, Audit and Judicial were borne by the Federal Government, Leeward Islands.

£774,120 has been allocated to the Colony under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1945 for the ten-year period ending 31st March, 1956. Development Schemes fall into six main heads on which commitments to the 31st December, 1952, are as follows:

- Agriculture and Forestry: £245,659
- Public Works: £312,614
- Education: £52,012
- Medical: £62,683
- Social Welfare: £18,148
- Miscellaneous: £7,254

In addition to the above it is proposed to raise a Colony loan of approximately £200,000, the tentative programme being:

- Ferro-concrete Jetty at Roseau: £67,000
- Goodwill Housing Scheme (Town expansion and slum clearance): £37,000
- Police Barracks and Fire Station: £13,000
- Unallocated: £11,000
- Roads: £72,000

Development of the banana industry is being assisted by Government advances to planters and a sum of £15,000 has been set aside for this purpose.

The Colonial Development Corporation recently completed the construction of modern fruit packing and cold storage plants. The Corporation is engaged on development of Melville Hall Estate, in the northern part of the island, and construction of a hydro-electric plant which is expected to be completed early in 1953.

Recent industrial development by private enterprise includes a fruit-canning factory, producing canned bananas, grapefruit segments and juice and citrus peel as well as jams and jellies made from locally-grown fruits.

There are 40 Elementary Schools with a total enrolment of 9,618 pupils, and four Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 583 pupils. There are also nine private or temporary schools with an enrolment of 676 pupils. There is no technical school nor any local institution of Higher Education. The number of students from this Colony known to be in Universities or University Colleges abroad is:

- United Kingdom: 8
- Canada: 1
- Jamaica (University College of the West Indies): 3
- United States of America: 1
- Trinidad (I.C.T.A.): 1
In 1951 Government expenditure on Education was approximately $210,000 as compared with $35,976 in 1935.

Government expenditure on medical and allied services in 1951 was $243,984 compared with $94,829 in 1935.

The Medical establishment consists of:
One Senior Medical Officer and Medical Officer of Health.
One Resident Medical Officer (Roseau Hospital).
Six District Medical Officers, and
One Dental Officer.

In addition there are three private practitioners—two physicians and one dentist. There are five Government hospitals including a Leper Home with a total of 176 beds. The latest available annual figure for out-patients is 50,287 and for in-patients 3,256. Regular clinics are held throughout the year by District Medical Officers at the 19 dispensaries distributed all over the island. A Maternal, Child Hygiene and School Health Service with its Headquarters in Roseau is operated by a Senior Health Visitor, assisted by three Health Visitors under the direction of the Senior Medical Officer. As part of its functions the clinic distributes free milk, cod liver oil and food yeast to needy and under-nourished children. There are also an Anti-Yaws Campaign and a Dental Service.

The Health Department with its auxiliary the Public Health Engineering Unit is under the control of the Senior Medical Officer who is also Chairman of the Central Board of Health. This Board is statutorily constituted and is responsible to Government for the initiation and carrying out of public health measures.

There are 102 miles of oiled surface roads and 213 miles of secondary roads. Leeward coast villages are linked by a coastal motor launch service.

Agriculture is the principal occupation and provides employment for about 5,000 wage-earners in addition to about 3,000 peasants. Road and building construction workers are estimated at 2,000.

There are three trade unions: two of workers, with an estimated membership of 5,000, and an employers' organization with approximately 50 members.

The main crops are limes, bananas, coconuts, grapefruit, oranges, cocoa, vanilla, mangoes, avocado pears and various ground provisions for domestic use. The main products are raw and sweetened lime juice, lime oil, copra and rum.

There is a considerable production of timber for local use, but no export trade.

The production of handicrafts from local straws is a widespread minor industry. The annual value of production is estimated at $36,000.

GRENADE

The total area is 133 square miles: Grenada 120, Carriacou 13 square miles.

The Colony's population of 80,056 is for the most part "coloured". There is a small "white" population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers.

Grenada is somewhat mountainous. The principal peak, Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), rises in the northern half of the island. The Grand Etang mountain system contains numerous peaks—Fedon's Camp (2,512 feet), Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet), Mt. Sinai (2,300 feet), Morne Piment (2,359 feet). Strictly speaking there are no coastal plains and, with the exception of the higher parts of the mountains, the country slopes gently to the sea. The island is well-watered with numerous short and quick-flowing rivers. The forest area of the Colony is estimated at 10,000 acres, approximately equally owned by the Crown and private enterprise.

Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month, and November the wettest.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650 the Governor of Martinique purchased the island from a French company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George's. This venture did not pay, and the island was eventually acquired by the Crown of France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. In 1795-96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. Many atrocities were committed, including the cold-blooded murder of the Governor and many prominent citizens. The rising was suppressed by Sir Ralph Abercrombie in 1796 and the ringleaders executed. Since that day there has been peace in Grenada.

The present constitution was introduced on 1st August, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex-officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Attorney-General and the Colonial Treasurer); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex-officio members (the Attorney-General and the Colonial Treasurer); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy-President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and general tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale of 3% to 50% in the $ for individuals, companies paying a special rate of 35% in the $. An agreement was reached in 1949 with various Governments for the avoidance of double taxation. Taxation is enforced in other forms through import, export and excise duties and licences.

The following is a table of public finance:

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 815,040     | 825,394         |
| 1939 | 759,874     | 833,692         |
| 1946 | 2,781,706   | 2,497,616       |
| 1947 | 2,752,810   | 2,513,615       |
| 1948 | 2,749,672   | 3,292,002       |
| 1949 | 2,647,837   | 3,163,295       |
| 1950 | 3,775,261   | 2,979,383       |
| 1951 | 3,942,028   | 3,840,416       |

The slight favourable revenue balance maintained over the period 1946-51 has been due to collections of import, export, additional export and excise duties and income tax which in turn have been entirely dependent on world market prices of cocoa and nutmegs. The actual expenditure in 1951 was 27.5% in excess of the estimated figure on account of civil disturbances which culminated in a state of emergency, higher costs of labour, storm damage, heavy election expenses under adult suffrage, and a 100% increase in cost-of-living allowances to Civil Servants.

At the end of 1951 the Public Debt amounted to $1,367,366 and accumulated Sinking Funds to $629,060.

Grenada received an allocation of $1,833,071 (£381,890) under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a Ten-Year Development Plan. In 1946 and again in 1950 this amount was augmented by sums totalling £459,264 making a total figure of £2,292,335 (£477,570).

The Plan was prepared and adopted in 1948 and, at the time, it was proposed to raise a loan
of $2,400,000 for use in conjunction with the original Colonial Development and Welfare grant to finance it.

In 1950 the Plan was revised and the uncommitted balance of the allocation which stood at $1,336,610 was reallocated for expenditure over the period 1950-56. In addition, the proposed loan of $2,400,000 which had not yet been negotiated was scaled down to $1,500,000 and this loan was eventually raised on the London market in 1952.

During the period 1950-56 more than $1,000,000 of Development and Welfare money will be devoted to schemes relating to agriculture and fisheries. The most expensive, and the most productive, agricultural scheme, is for cocoa rehabilitation for which a sum of $412,000 has been earmarked. Expenditure on other schemes is being created in the following order of priority: Water Supplies, Electricity, Police Headquarters, Research, Queen's Park Bridge, Medical, Education, Slum Clearance and Housing, Reclamation, Revision of Laws, Civil Service Housing, Social Welfare, Communications, Printing.

It has not so far been possible to attract the assistance of any organization of suitable capacity by way of investing in any desirable major development scheme at present beyond the competence of the Colony to finance.

There are 53 Primary Schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 18,114 and average attendance amounting to 12,473. Compulsory attendance is enforced in the capital and one other area where accommodation is regarded as adequate. Thirteen of the Primary Schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned structures of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are three housecraft and three handicraft centres in the Colony. There is also a visual education unit which serves the whole Colony. Five Secondary Schools (one Government and four grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,027 of which 117 are scholarship or exhibition holders. Two of the schools are for boys only, two for girls only and one co-educational. One additional girls' Secondary School (300 places) is at present under construction by the Roman Catholic authorities. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate standard and the Grenada Boys' Secondary School also prepares pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1951 was $389,298. In 1935 the total expenditure on education amounted to $73,080.

The Government awards, among others, a biennial island scholarship tenable at a university in the British Empire, open to both male and female candidates, and a biennial agricultural scholarship tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad.

There have been no epidemics of infectious diseases recently. Malaria is still prevalent. With the assistance of W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. organizations, an Insect Control Programme will come into full operation early in 1953. The Colony Hospital is at St. George's. The Princess Alice Hospital provides 32 beds and there is another small hospital at Carriacou. There are 21 district medical visiting stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Here, too, maternity and child-welfare work is done in addition to what is accomplished in three health centres having this specific function.

Expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1951 amounted to $494,610 compared with $97,987 in 1935.

The airfield is at Pearls, and has a runway 5,280 feet long and 150 feet wide.

There are approximately 472 miles of good roads divided into four classes according to standard of construction. Over 200 miles have an oiled surface.

The chief ports are St. George's (possessing a good harbour and a deep water pier), Grenville and Hillsborough (Carriacou). Cargo services are operated by the Harrison Line steamers from the United Kingdom and by calls of the Canadian National Steamship Company and the Alcoa Line from Canadian and United States ports. Several small motor, auxiliary and sailing vessels ply regularly between the islands.

Government is at present operating an experimental broadcasting service on a frequency of 3.485 megacycles in the 90-metre band. This pilot service is precursory of the establishment of a 5 kw. station (see above under Windward Islands).

The following is a summary of gainfully-employed labour for 1950:

| Agriculture |
|-------------|
| (a) Field Workers | 5,340 |
| (b) Spice Curing Stations | 517 |
| (c) Sugar production |
| In Season | 90 |
| Out Season | 50 |

| Government |
|-------------|
| P.W.D. labour force | 1,400 |
| Business (Clerks, etc.) | 1,097 |

Total | 8,494 |

The main crops of the Island are cocoa, nutmegs, mace, bananas and coconuts.

A livestock census in 1946 showed: cattle 6,761, horses 473, mules 229, asses 2,874, sheep 6,725, goats 9,488, and pigs 9,433.

There is a cigarette factory, a soap factory, and a sugar factory producing unrefined sugar for local consumption. The sugar factory also operates a continuous rum-distilling plant and together with a number of estates equipped with pot stills, supply the demand for uncured rum. A lime factory and two estate equipped lime stills deal with the Island's lime crop. There is also a Government-operated cotton ginnery in Carriacou.

ST. LUCIA

The area is 233 square miles and the population 80,000 (1951 mid-year estimate).

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September–October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.
The date and the person who discovered St. Lucia are unknown, for according to the known evidence of Columbus's voyages, Columbus appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for £1,600 to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1663 Thomas Warner of St. Kitts made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1744 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April, 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Griffield on 22nd June, 1803, and has since continued under British rule.

The present constitution was introduced on 1st August, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex-officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex-officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is president of the Council, and there is a deputy-president appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 6d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

The following is a table of public finance.

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 94,485     | 105,205        |
| 1939 | 130,161    | 132,732        |
| 1946 | 358,388    | 308,194        |
| 1947 | 282,754    | 325,356        |
| 1948 | 364,725    | 499,472        |
| 1949 | 606,480    | 622,655        |
| 1950 | 674,059    | 741,238        |
| 1951 | 926,840    | 888,378        |

It was estimated that in 1951 28·8% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise duties, and 7% from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: 18·82%
- Administration: 7·58%
- Public Works: 11·42%
- Development: 48·49%

The Public Debt of the Colony at 31st December, 1951, stood at £587,998 (approximately £6 13s. per head of population).

Under the 1945 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, St. Lucia was allocated £374,632.
In 1950 an allocation of £150,000 towards a road programme was agreed and an additional grant of £200,000 is to be made available to implement the agricultural development plans of the Colony based upon the recommendations of a Team of Experts which visited the Island in 1951. The Colonial Development Corporation have been active in the reconstruction of Castries since 1948. In 1950 His late Majesty's Government agreed to provide up to a maximum of £1,025,000 to assist the St. Lucia Government to rebuild public buildings and housing accommodation in Castries which were destroyed by the fire of 1948. Since that time Her Majesty's Government has agreed to provide a further £84,000 for that purpose. The reconstruction programme is expected to be completed early in 1953.

In the 1951-52 session there were two students from St. Lucia at the University College of the West Indies, Jamaica. There were 13 students at Universities in the United Kingdom, six in Canada, eight in the United States, and one at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture. Of these, 11 held Government scholarships, the balance being private students. There were two Secondary Schools with 517 pupils on the roll, and 48 Primary Schools with a total of 13,459 pupils enrolled. The Extra-mural Department of the University College of the West Indies conducted adult education classes throughout the year, and the aggregate attendance was 2,707. The total expenditure for 1951, including Colonial Development and Welfare grants, was £69,340, compared with £6,692 in 1955.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1951 is estimated at £54,390, as compared with £11,624 in 1935. Beds available in hospitals totalled 154, in addition to out-patient treatment. There are 12 dispensaries and health outposts and a day nursery; 28,510 persons attended clinics or health outposts. The World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund have made grants towards the implementation of insect control in St. Lucia.

There are two airfields, the Vigie Airport, and the Beane Field Airport. Air services with the other islands are maintained by British West Indian Airways Incorporated, and chartered flights by K.L.M. and British Guiana Airways. The island's road system comprises the following:

| Roads          | Miles |
|----------------|-------|
| Main roads     | 105.64|
| Second Class Roads | 95.65 |
| Unclassified Roads | 169.85|

Total: 371.14

Cargo steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa, the Harrison Line, and numerous inter-island craft are the main means of communication by sea.

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture (16,000). Other gainful occupations are fishing (1,043), manufacturing (4,000), public services (1,199), lumbering (221), transportation (588), and quarrying (68).

The main crops are sugar, coconuts, cocoa, cassava, bananas, yams, rice, cotton, and citrus. Livestock estimates based on the 1946 census are: cattle 15,000, pigs 20,000, sheep 9,000, goats 7,000, horses, mules and donkeys 1,500, poultry 45,000.

Timber extraction, based on 1950 estimates, was 500,000 board feet.

There is a fair amount of fishing, but the supply does not meet the demand.

The principal manufactures are sugar, rum, citrus products, edible oils, cotton ginning, cigarettes, and mineral waters.

ST. VINCENT

The total area of the Colony, together with the Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles. The population at the end of 1951 was 70,130.

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufriere (4,048 feet). Other peaks are Morne Garu and Richmond Peak (3,525 feet), Grand Bonhomme (3,177 feet) and Mount St. Andrew (2,413 feet). None of the rivers are navigable. The area under forest is approximately 87 square miles.

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At Kingstown, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 85·8°, and the rainfall 104·17 inches, in 1951.

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British 14 years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, when France declared war on Britain in 1778, St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

The present constitution was introduced on 1st October, 1951. There is an Executive Council normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex-officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Colonial Treasurer); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex-officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Colonial Treasurer); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is president of the Council, and there is a deputy-president appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals ranging from 3 cents to 78 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 30 cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty, which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 14s. 2d. per proof gallon.

The following is a table of public finance:

| Year | Revenue ($B.W.I.) | Expenditure ($B.W.I.) |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1938 | 489,677           | 464,458               |
| 1939 | 490,262           | 481,790               |
| 1946 | 1,624,598         | 1,580,275             |
| 1947 | 1,679,419         | 1,561,382             |
| 1948 | 1,482,321         | 1,457,906             |
| 1949 | 1,826,664         | 1,802,191             |
| 1950 | 1,784,347         | 1,919,991             |
| 1951 | 2,183,392         | 2,317,061             |
| 1952 (a) | 1,856,853 | 2,121,309             |

(a) Estimate.

Customs and excise duties are calculated to produce $963,000 (or 51·86%) of the total revenue while direct taxation is expected to yield $246,000 (or 13·24%).
The Public Debt at 31st December, 1951, was $613,458, equivalent to $9.94 per head of the (1946) population.

The Ten-Year Development Plan, compiled in 1946, envisaged an allocation of £345,838 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945, supplemented by £401,500 from Loan Funds and £359,075 from Colony Funds. In 1951 the Plan was revised, and for the period 1951–56 it is proposed to spend £129,700 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds and £174,200 from Loan Funds on development schemes, allocated as follows:

| C.D. & W. Funds | Loan Funds |
|-----------------|------------|
| Agriculture     | £78,700    |
| Industrial Development | £11,000 |
| Miscellaneous   | £40,000    |

In 1951 and 1952 additional allocations of Colonial Development and Welfare money totalling £100,000 were granted to the Colony.

A Development Committee has been formed to advise the Government on projects likely to add to the economic well-being of the Colony. The Colonial Development Corporation has been granted an 80-year franchise for the establishment and operation of a hydro-electric scheme. Plans are under consideration for the extension of the cultivation of tree crops, particularly cocoa and coffee, in areas now covered with forest, and for the establishment of another sugar factory.

In 1951 there were two Government Secondary Schools and one grant-aided Secondary School with an enrolment of 537 pupils and 40 Primary Schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 14,390 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions.

During 1951–52 some 32 St. Vincent students were attending Universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1951 expenditure on educational services amounted to approximately $317,180, of which the contribution of the United Kingdom under Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $12,730. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

Of tropical diseases yaws is prevalent and tuberculosis is a major health problem, but does not appear to be increasing (average deaths over a five-year period were 57 annually). Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

Total expenditure in 1951 on Government Health and Medical Services was $321,292; in 1935, $66,945.

There are 20 dispensaries, at which 25,285 cases were treated in 1951; hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery) ... 104
- Maternity ... 16
- Tuberculosis ... 40
- Mental ... 90
- Leprosy ... 22
- Pauper Home ... 125

In 1951 in-patients numbered 3,056; out-patients, 2,196.

The seadrome is situated at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown. There are about 400 miles of roads of which some 100 miles are motorable throughout the year; 45½ miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 38 miles of metalled roads and about 310½ miles of earth roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly passenger/cargo service is provided from Canada by the Canadian National Steamship Company, also a monthly cargo service with limited passenger accommodation. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service every six weeks by the Harrison Line; from New York and Canada a monthly and fortnightly service respectively by the Alcoa Steamship Company.

The main crops are arrowroot, cotton, copra and coconut, sweet potatoes, groundnuts and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is: goats 11,039; cattle 7,741; sheep 3,294; horses and mules 253; swine 9,369.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

There is fairly extensive fishing in-shore but very little is done off-shore. Catches are often insufficient to meet demand.

There are a good many privately-owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a soap and cigarette factory; an oil expressing and refining plant for cotton seed and coconut oil, with their by-products of stock feed and manure, and a deodorizing plant for the treatment of coconut and fish oils at the Central Cotton Ginnery; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks.
