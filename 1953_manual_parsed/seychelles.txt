SEYCHELLES

The Colony lies in the Indian Ocean 970 miles east of Zanzibar. Its area is 156½ square miles.

The estimated population at 31st December, 1951, was 36,613.

The Colony’s 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation. Over fourteen square miles are under forest and woodland.

In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly
lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon, and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunder storms are rare. The average annual rainfall in Victoria up to 1951 was 99·86 inches and the mean temperature was 82°.

Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 9,000.

The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May, 1794, when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Isle de France: Mauritius and Seychelles, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution, and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, three official members and four unofficial members three of whom are elected members and one a nominated member of the Legislative Council.

All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

The principal form of direct taxation is income tax which up to 31st December, 1952, was levied on all income other than that derived from coconuts, vanilla, cinnamon, patchouli or their products—which were subject to export duty. As from 1st January, 1953, income tax will be levied on all sources of income. Rates of tax, subject to the usual allowances, are:

- 2½% on first Rs. 3,000 taxable income.
- 5% on next Rs. 3,000 then increasing by 2½% for each Rs. 1,000 of taxable income up to Rs. 15,000.
- Rs. 15,000–Rs. 25,000, 30%.
- Rs. 25,000–Rs. 40,000, 40%.
- All taxable income over Rs. 40,000, 50%.

Companies pay a flat rate of 30%.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates, and export duties. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony.

| Year | Revenue (Rs.) | Expenditure (Rs.) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1938 | 892,540      | 834,733           |
| 1939 | 1,167,764    | 1,105,822         |
| 1946 | 3,376,382    | 1,863,549         |
| 1947 | 2,576,553    | 2,283,987         |
| 1948 | 2,950,528    | 3,038,787         |
| 1949 | 3,366,431    | 4,025,269         |
| 1950 | 5,025,346    | 3,240,903         |

In 1952 62% of revenue was derived from Customs and 0·90% from direct taxes. The Public Debt of Seychelles at the end of December 1950 amounted to Rs. 390,215·78 in respect of a loan from His late Majesty's Government in 1938, repayable in 30 years, to finance the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. The accumulated Sinking Fund to date amounts to Rs. 154,878·61.

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling-backed and worth 1s. 6d.

A Development Plan for the years 1946 to 1956 is in operation for the building of new roads, schools, hospitals and clinics, housing, reafforestation, and health development, towards the cost of which an allocation of £250,000 was made from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. The original ten-year plan is practically completed and further capital works are being financed from local funds.

A fishing development scheme financed and run by the Colonial Development Corporation (Seychelles Fisheries) was wound up during 1952. The Company left a fish-drying and processing factory at St. Anne Island.

Educational institutions number 41 in all, including continuation classes, teacher training, student nurses, etc. There are 2,328 boys and 2,286 girls in the Primary schools and 151 boys and 165 girls in the Secondary schools, and 18 technical apprentices. There is no higher education in the Colony. Thirteen students are studying in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Government expenditure on education in 1952 was Rs. 503,380, compared with Rs. 27,528 in 1935.
Although within the tropics, Seychelles has few of the diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Filariasis and leprosy are uncommon and malaria completely absent. The main diseases are in three groups: intestinal parasitic infestations; venereal diseases; tuberculosis. The first two are common and affect approximately one half of the population but the incidence of tuberculosis is not high. The enteric fevers are very rare. Preventive medicine and public health measures include a quarantine service mainly directed against imported disease from India and Africa and particularly against malaria. Six Health Inspectors are in charge of environmental sanitation, food inspection including locally slaughtered meat, and the control of communicable disease. A scheme to control the incidence of venereal disease commenced in August 1952. On the curative side there are four hospitals (and four out-patient clinics) providing a total in-patient accommodation of 152 beds; a mental hospital; and a settlement on Curieuse Island for the treatment of leprosy; 3,531 in-patients and 42,291 out-patients were treated in 1951, the mental hospital treated an average of 43 patients and the leprosy settlement an average of 47 cases. Seychelles Hospital, Victoria, is a modern hospital with children's and maternity sections, a full laboratory service, and limited X-ray facilities.

Expenditure on health and medical services by the Government was Rs. 494,900 in 1951, compared with Rs. 72,682 in 1935. The medical expenditure per head of population was Rs. 2·32 in 1935 and Rs. 13·51 in 1951.

There are 86 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet, earth-surfaced. Tarmac surfacing is in progress in Victoria and suburbs.

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 25–40 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. British India Steam Navigation Company vessels on the Bombay–Mombasa service call at Seychelles monthly from Mombasa and about seven times a year from Bombay. Direct loading cargo steamers from the United Kingdom call quarterly.

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and re-diffusion) station broadcasts nightly for one hour on a wavelength of 52 metres, 5770 kc/s. with an output of 100/130 watts. Wireless receiving licences are being re-introduced in January 1953 to finance expanded broadcasting services. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated number in employment in this industry is 19,800. Other occupations are:

- Domestic Service: 2,580
- Artisans: 2,340
- Public administration and the professions: 440
- Trade and Commerce: 200

There are three Trade Unions—

1. The Stevedore and Lighterage Workers' Union membership: 153
2. The Seychelles Building Union membership: 230
3. The General Workers' Union membership: 118

The main crops are coconuts, cinnamon, patchouli and vanilla; breadfruit, bananas, cassava, yams and sweet potatoes are grown for local consumption.

In 1950 livestock numbered: cattle 2,122; pigs 2,328; goats 1,200; poultry 40,000.

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,000–1,500 tons per annum. The fishing industry is mainly confined to local needs but there is a small export of salt fish to East Africa.

Deposits of sea-bird guano are worked on the distant coral islands of the Aldabra and Farquhar groups. Some 10,000 tons of this phosphatic fertilizer are exported annually.

Copra manufacture is carried out in locally-made copra kilns. There are about 50 essential oil distilleries, mostly cottage stills. Two small coir factories produce rope and coir mattress fibre for local use. Two coconut farms produce soap from coconut oil for local use.

The chief imports are grain and flour, sugar, butter, cheese, vehicles, petroleum and cotton piece goods.

There are as yet no true co-operative societies in the colony. Agricultural credit is available from the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. A Copra Producers' and Shippers' Committee is responsible for the marketing of copra. The Copra Price Stabilization Ordinance, 1949, provides for a cess of 6% of the f.o.b. price of copra. These funds may be used to subsidize prices to the producer should world prices decline.
