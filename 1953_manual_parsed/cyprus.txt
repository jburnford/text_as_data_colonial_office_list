CYPRUS

The island of Cyprus is 3,572 square miles in area.

The population in 1952 was 498,000, made up as follows:

Greek Orthodox... 400,000
Turkish Moslem... 89,000
Others... 9,000

Geographically the three main zones are:

(a) the Kyrenia range, which rises to a height of over 3,000 feet, running along the northern coast and terminating in the Karpas peninsula;
(b) the massif in the south-west of the island, of which the highest point is Mount Olympus (6,406 feet) and;
(c) the central plain, situated between these ranges, known as the "Mesaoria".

The climate is varied; hot and dry in the plains in summer and damp on the coast; in winter the mountains are covered with snow for several weeks, while the weather in the rest of the island is generally mild. Recordings at Nicosia (536 feet above sea level) during the last 15 years show a mean annual temperature of 66°-7°, a mean maximum of 78°-5°, a mean minimum of 54°-9° and an annual rainfall of 15·01 inches.
The principal towns are:

| Town          | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| Nicosia (capital) | 40,000     |
| Limassol      | 27,000     |
| Famagusta     | 20,000     |
| Larnaca       | 16,000     |
| Paphos        | 6,000      |
| Kyrenia       | 3,000      |

The history of Cyprus is long and eventful. In early historical times the island had been under the rule of Persia, Egypt, Rome and Byzantium. During the last named period its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. In 1191 Cyprus was conquered by Richard I of England following the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. From Richard the island passed to the Knights Templars, and later, when they found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, although the Genoese Republic held Famagusta from 1373 until 1464. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island and retained possession of it until its transfer to British administration.

On 4th June, 1878, a convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements" consented "to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England".

On 14th August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of 5th November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognized the annexation.

On 1st May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally made a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Up to 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent of 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by Executive and Legislative Councils. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official members and 15 elected members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and 12 by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island, those clauses of the Letters Patent which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor. There is an Executive Council consisting, at present, of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, the Commissioner of Labour, and three non-official members.

Individual ownership of land is recognized and non-natives may acquire land. Except with the consent of the Governor, no alien may acquire, otherwise than by inheritance, ownership of any immovable property in the Colony. Compulsory acquisition of land may be made for purposes of public utility, with the consent of the Governor.

The Income Tax Law provides for the exemption from tax of incomes which do not exceed £300, and for the payment of tax ranging from 1s. for every £ in excess of £300 to 15s. for every £ in excess of £6,000. In the case of bachelors and spinsters the tax payable is increased by 33½% rising to 50% where the tax payable exceeds £90, up to a maximum of £500. Companies and similar bodies pay a flat rate of 7s. 6d. in the £ and deduct this tax from any dividends declared; credit is given to the shareholder for the tax thus paid in calculating his personal tax liability. Arrangements for relief from double taxation exist with the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and relief is also given if tax is payable on the same income in any of Her Majesty's possessions where reciprocal relief is given. By an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom and the Greek Government there is reciprocal exemption of air transport profits between Cyprus and Greece.

Estate duty is levied on the estate of any deceased person which exceeds £2,000 in value. The rates of estate duty are not fixed on a percentage basis in the case of estates of £15,000 in value and under. Such estates are divided into categories and the rates are specific amounts chargeable on each category. The specific amounts so chargeable range from £40 on estates between £2,000 and £2,500 in value to £1,615 on estates between £14,000 and £15,000 in value. In the case of estates in excess of £15,000 in value a percentage is imposed. This percentage ranges between 21½% and 30% on that part of the estate which exceeds £15,000 in value. Relief is given in respect of quick succession where the estate consists of immovable property or a business.

The following is a table of public finance in Cyprus:

In 1951 revenue raised by taxation amounted to £6,031,010 or 83·75% of the total revenue of the Colony: on the basis of the 1946 Census population figure of 449,450 the taxation per head approximated to £13 8s. 3d.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Recurrent: excluding loans and advances £4,155,742
- Non-Recurrent £162,739
- Defence and War Measures, Supplies and Transport £342,700
- Long-term Loans and Advances £357,353

£5,018,534

The Public Debt of Cyprus at the end of December, 1951, amounted to £5,204,991
(approximately £11 10s. 4d. per head of population). The Public Debt comprises:

The Accountant-General, as Commissioner of Currency, is authorized to provide, issue and re-issue currency notes of the Government, such notes being legal tender for the payment of any amount. Provision is made for the conversion of notes into sterling and vice versa, at par, through the Crown Agents for the Colonies in London, and for the establishment of a Note Security Fund. Notes of the following denominations are in circulation: £5, £1, 10s., 5s., 2s., 1s. and 3 piastras.

An allocation of £1,750,000 has been made for Cyprus under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan which was begun in 1946. Further sums totalling approximately £250,000 will also be contributed.

The plan, which in 1946 was estimated to cost £4,160,000, was revised in 1951 and is now estimated to cost £7,988,000, of which £4,532,000 is for schemes prepared when the plan was launched and £3,456,000 for new schemes. It is proposed to find the money from the following sources:

| Source                                      | Amount   |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Colonial Development and Welfare grants     | £2,005,500|
| Loan Monies raised in Cyprus                | £287,000  |
| Cyprus Revenue                              | £5,695,500|

It is proposed to spend the funds as follows:

| Service                                      | Amount   |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| Basic Services                               | £1,581,000|
| Social Services                              | £2,374,000|
| Productive Services                          | £4,033,000|

£7,988,000

Basic Services.—Of the total amount allocated 23·55% will be spent on roads and 42·90% on village water supplies and village improvement.

Social Services.—About 60% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 26·16% on education.

Productive Services.—34·81% of the total amount will be spent on agriculture, including soil conservation and the development of certain large estates in Paphos District which were compulsorily acquired for this purpose from their absentee owners; and 26% on irrigation.

Owing to the inadequacy of the existing electricity supplies, Government prepared an electrification scheme providing for a single large power station and a transmission network to supply all areas in the island. This scheme was launched in 1950 and will be carried out in three stages. It is expected that the first stage will be completed towards the end of 1952 and the second stage by the end of the development decennium. With the completion of these two stages it will be possible to supply current to most of the areas of the island. It is not yet possible to say when the third stage will be undertaken. It is intended that the scheme should be run as a public utility undertaking by the "Electricity Authority of Cyprus" to be established under a law in this respect which has already been published as a Bill. The scheme is being financed with funds borrowed by Government and re-lent to the above-mentioned authority. The first stage of the scheme is estimated to cost £2,500,000 and the second £2,000,000. No estimate has yet been prepared for the third stage.

In addition to the funds provided for the electrification scheme, Government has advanced and will continue advancing loans to public bodies and local government authorities to enable them to carry out their own development projects, e.g. workers' housing schemes, water supplies, street improvement, erection of public buildings, etc. From the beginning of the development decennium to the end of 1951 these loans amounted to £1,170,000, and it is estimated that by the end of the development decennium another £1,800,000 will be required for the same purpose, i.e. during the decennium Government's investment in what may be termed "indirect" development will total £3,000,000.

There is at present no form of higher education in Cyprus other than the two Teachers Training Colleges, one for men at Morphou and one for women at Nicosia. Secondary schools number 50 with an enrolment of 14,231, while elementary schools number 711 with an enrolment of 65,397. There are separate schools for Greeks, Turks, and Armenians, but most schools are co-educational. The school population is steadily increasing at present with a consequent rise in the number of teachers required and a need for more accommodation. Efforts are being made to develop technical education to a level more in keeping with the needs of the island.

In 1951–52 there were 47 Government scholars in the United Kingdom and 196 private students, a total of 243. A number of teachers, sent on study leave with pay, are included among the private students.

Government expenditure on educational services in 1951 amounted to £535,746 compared with £121,986 in 1935.

Expenditure by Government on medical and allied services was £356,611 in 1951 compared with £52,436 in 1935. Ten Government hospitals (including two sanatoria, a mental hospital and a leper farm) provided 1,019 beds in 1951. In addition there were 345 beds in 49 private clinics and 101 beds in 13 rural hospitals. In-patients numbered 9,004 in Government institutions and 1,883 in rural hospitals. Out-patients at Government institutions numbered 101,137, rural dispensaries dealt with 55,754.

Cyprus Airways Limited provide air services to the United Kingdom, Athens, Rome, Turkey, the Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, the Sudan and the Persian Gulf. Other airlines serving the Colony
are B.O.A.C., Greek National Airlines, El Al, Middle East Airlines, Misrair and Turkish State Airways. There is one airfield at Nicosia and emergency landing grounds at Tymbou and Larnaca. There are no internal services.

There are 3,088 miles of road of which 740 miles are asphalted. The rest have gravel (1,933 miles) or earth (415 miles) surfaces.

The chief port is Famagusta. There are also roadstead accommodation and customs facilities at Limassol, Larnaca, Kyrenia, Paphos and Xeros. Regular passenger services are run between Limassol and Haifa, Larnaca and Venice or Genoa. Cargo ships of many nationalities call at each of the ports, the most regular being British vessels of the Conference Lines, some of which accept passengers.

There is no railway or inland waterway.

The Government broadcasting station is situated at Nicosia and will operate on a medium-wave frequency with a power of 10 kw. Broadcasts will be in English, Greek and Turkish. The station is expected to be fully operative in 1953. In the meantime experimental transmissions are being broadcast on a limited power of 2 kw., using temporary studios. Arrangements have been made for the importation of cheap radio receivers suitable for village operation. The number of licence holders in 1952 was 17,000, most of them in urban areas.

The principal occupation is agriculture. Estimated numbers in other occupations in 1950 were:—manufacturing industries 44,000 (building and contracting 8,800, clothing 7,000, textiles 5,700); service industries 51,400 (distributive trades 10,500, catering and hotels 7,000); mines and quarries 6,300; Government service 6,000.

The main crops and products are wheat, barley, potatoes, grapes, raisins, cotton, deciduous fruit, olives, almonds, carobs (locust beans), citrus, pulse crops, sesame, cumin, onions, tobacco, wines, spirits, cheese and wool.

The livestock population is: sheep 295,000, goats 149,000, swine 39,000, cattle 33,000, donkeys 51,000, mules 8,000, horses 5,000.

Timber production in 1951 was 527,000 cubic feet R.U.B. The 408,500 cubic feet of wood fuel produced was all consumed locally. Imports of timber in 1951 totalled 2,592,000 cubic feet.

The principal minerals are cupreous and iron pyrites and asbestos. Some 700,000 tons of pyrites, 100,000 tons of copper concentrates and 15,000 tons of asbestos are exported yearly. Chromite, gypsum and terra umbra are also produced.

Cotton yarn spun by one mill satisfies most of the home requirements. The two main weaving plants which are now in operation may be expected to meet the local demand for towels and cotton goods. There is also a separate plant for the dyeing and finishing of cloth. Other industries include the manufacturing of cigarettes from imported and locally grown yellow-leaf tobacco, brewing, tanning, soap making, soap oils, footwear, buttons, wines and spirits, artificial teeth, carob gum, essential oils, nails and crown corks. A gypsum calcining plant went into production at the beginning of December 1951. The present output is estimated to be 72,000 tons of plaster per annum, with which 3,000,000 square yards of plasterboard may be manufactured by a new plant, which went into production in March 1952. This will leave about 50,000 tons of plaster annually for disposal.

The most important village industry in the island is lace-making, employing 1,200 people. Other village industries are twine, rope, basket and mat-making.

The chief imports are wheat and wheaten flour, timber, machinery, iron and steel manufactures, vehicles, cotton, silk and woollen manufactures, empty sacks, and manures.

There are at present no marketing boards in Cyprus, but all zivania (grape alcohol used in the wines and spirits industry) must be delivered to the Vine Products Control Scheme against an initial purchase price for which an advance is provided by Government. All profits from the sales of zivania by the Vine Products Controller are returned to the producers in the form of dividends. The Controller (Registrar of Co-operative Societies) is advised by a Board on which producers and manufacturers are represented. A special reserve fund for stabilization or other purposes has been created. Government is also the sole purchaser of wheat and barley through the agency of co-operative societies.

The only other organized form of marketing is that of the various co-operative marketing societies and unions, which deal with substantial quantities of carobs, wines and spirits, and potatoes and lesser quantities of oranges, cherries and other fresh and dried fruits. There are 662 co-operative societies, the main types being credit, marketing, processing, consumers' stores and farming societies. Membership exceeds 105,000, reserves are more than £600,000 and deposits approximately £1,300,000.
