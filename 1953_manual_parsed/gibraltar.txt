### GIBRALTAR

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, with an area of 17 square miles. It consists of a long, high mountain called The Rock and a sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles and its greatest breadth ¾ of a mile.

The population is European and at the census of July 1951 numbered 22,848.
The climate is mild and temperate; snow or frost is extremely rare. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in winter are 45° and 65° respectively. In summer a warm breeze laden with moisture, known as the "Levanter," strikes the eastern face of the Rock, condenses in the sky above and causes a cloud pall to hang over the city and bay. During this period the climate is humid and relaxing. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in summer are 55° and 85° respectively. The rainy season is spread over the period September to May; the average annual rainfall is 35 inches.

Gibraltar was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain. It was held alternately by Moors and Spaniards until 1704 when, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke and ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Elliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

The Gibraltar (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, three ex-officio members, two nominated members appointed by the Governor and five elected members. The ex-officio members are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary. The Order in Council empowers the Governor to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony with the advice and consent of the Council. The Governor possesses the usual reserve of power to pass into law any measure necessary or expedient in his opinion in the interests of public order, public faith or good government (including defence). The Gibraltar Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions provide that the Governor shall be advised in the exercise of his powers by an Executive Council consisting of four ex-officio members and three unofficial members. The ex-officio members are the Deputy Fortress Commander, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

Taxation is mainly indirect. An Income Tax Ordinance was enacted in April 1952 and will come into force on the 1st April, 1953. There are no excise duties.

The main heads of taxation in 1951 were:

- Customs.
- Estate Duties.
- Stamp Duties.
- Licences.
- Trades Tax.
- Fuel Oil Tax.
- Coffee Tax.

The items subject to import duty are alcoholic beverages, perfumed spirits, motor spirits, tobacco and coffee.

The Government lottery yielded £84,203.

Local Government notes and United Kingdom silver and copper coins are legal tender in the Colony. Colonial Government currency notes were in circulation to the value of £946,515 at 31st December, 1951. The issue is governed by the Currency Note Ordinance and is of the following denominations: £5, £1, 10s.

There are six secondary and 16 primary and infants' schools with a total number of pupils at 31st December, 1951, of 3,153. Government expenditure on education in 1951 amounted to £57,086 compared with £48,508 in 1950 and estimated expenditure in 1952 of £66,079.

Approximately 50 students of both sexes are undergoing courses of higher education in the United Kingdom.

Total expenditure on medical and public health services in 1951 was £103,642 compared with £22,966 in 1935. The number of beds available in hospitals was:

- Colonial Hospital (General) .. 153
- King George V Hospital (Diseases of the Chest) .. 64
- Infectious Diseases Hospital .. 30
- Mental Hospital .. 42

The number of in-patients at the Colonial Hospital during the year was 2,006 and 12,576 were treated as out-patients.

There is no civil airfield in the Colony, but restricted use of the R.A.F. aerodrome at North Front by civil aircraft is permitted, subject to termination if military considerations so require. British European Airways operate five services a week between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, via Madrid and Bordeaux. Gibraltar Airways operate a daily service (four/five flights) to and from Tangier.

The length of road open for traffic is 5½ miles in the city, 4 miles in the south district and about 3½ miles in the area of North Front and Catalan Bay. All roads are suitable for motor traffic.
The total arrival of vessels of all kinds during 1951 was 5,633 with a net tonnage of 9,318,891. The majority called for oil or coal bunkers or repairs. The following passenger services were in operation:

- Orient Line to and from the United Kingdom ... monthly
- Union Castle Line to and from the United Kingdom ... monthly
- Italia Line, New York/Naples/Genoa ... fortnightly
- American Export Lines, New York/Palermo/Naples/Piraeus/Haifa ... monthly
- Polish Ocean Lines, Gdynia/Southampton/Port Said/Bombay/Karachi ... monthly

Approximately one cargo vessel a week arrived from the United Kingdom. A passenger and car ferry service to and from Tangier was operated by the Bland Line. There is also a daily passenger ferry service between Gibraltar and Algeciras.

There is no wireless broadcasting system in Gibraltar, and those desiring to obtain British programmes listen to short-wave transmissions from the B.B.C. There is a local radio distribution service, operated by the military authorities for military personnel, which also relays programmes from the B.B.C.

More than half of the wage-earners in Gibraltar, of whom a large proportion are Spaniards entering for work daily, are employed in one or other of the Service Departments, the Colonial Government, or the City Council. Commercial enterprises provide employment for a substantial number of clerical workers in shipping offices and trading agencies. Hotels, catering services, retail distributing trades and stevedoring are the other main sources of private employment. Other sources of employment are the main local industries—the processing of tobacco and the roasting and blending of coffee. There is also a fish and fruit canning factory.

At the end of December 1951 the total registered labour force was 20,780. There are 13 registered trade unions in the Colony with an estimated total paid-up membership of some 2,744.

Actual figures of imports are available only for dutiable articles and the figures given below are therefore largely estimates:

| Year | Total Imports (£) | Re-exports (£) |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| 1950 | 4,967,900        | 1,576,910     |
| 1951 | 5,449,000        | 3,698,084     |

The figures of re-exports are only in respect of goods liable to import duty upon entry.
