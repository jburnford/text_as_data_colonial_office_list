JAMAICA

Jamaica is an island situated in the Caribbean Sea, about 90 miles south of Cuba. Its area is 4,411·21 square miles.

The mid-year estimate of population in 1951 was 1,430,000. At the 1943 census the total population was 1,237,063 with the following racial origins:

| Race           | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| European      | 13,809     |
| African       | 965,960    |
| East Indian   | 21,393     |
| Syrian        | 834        |
| Chinese       | 6,879      |
| Mixed or Coloured | 227,148 |
| Not specified | 1,040      |

The Island is mountainous and rises in the centre to 7,402 feet (Blue Mountain Peak). Other prominent mountain ranges are Manchester Mountains (Mount Denham 3,236 feet) Mocho Mountains (Bull Head 2,782 feet) Santa Cruz Mountains (Munro 2,500 feet). The area of land over 1,000 feet above sea level is 2,110 square miles; that above 5,000 feet is 39 square miles. There are numerous rivers. Forest lands comprise about 400,000 acres, of which 232,000 constitute the Government Forest Reserves.

Generally speaking, the rainy months are May and October but in the extreme north-east winter rains fall between November and January. The heaviest annual rainfall, which exceeds 200 inches, occurs near the Blue Mountain Ridge in the north-east, the lowest in the extreme south. Hurricanes occur on the average once in seven years. The table at the foot of the page shows temperatures and rainfall for selected areas in 1951.

The capital is Kingston, which, together with Port Royal, has an estimated population of 136,570. The other principal towns are:

Montego Bay . . . . . . 11,547
Spanish Town . . . . . . 12,007

(1943 census)

The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted for over a century and a half. When the riches of Mexico and Peru were opened up by the conquistadores, the Spaniards flocked to the mainland from the island colonies and Jamaica became little more than a supply base for expeditions to

the mainland of America. The population, which had never been very great, dwindled to an insignificant and impoverished community which offered little resistance to the English invasion under Admiral Penn and General Venables in 1655. With this date the modern history of the Jamaican people may be said to begin. The last attempt to recover the island for Spain collapsed and the last remnant of the Spaniards left Jamaica from Runaway Bay in 1660. The Spaniards had imported slaves from Africa, most of whom they took with them, but a small number remained in the mountains of the interior and formed the nucleus of the Maroons. Of the present community, the founders and pioneers were colonists who came from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the seventeenth century.

The present constitution, granted in 1944, provides for a Privy Council, an Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

The Privy Council consists of the Officer Commanding the Troops, two Government officials and two nominated unofficial members. It advises the Governor in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government service and in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy.

The Executive Council is the principal instrument of policy. It is presided over by the Governor and consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Financial Secretary, the Attorney-General, two unofficial nominated members from the Legislative Council and five unofficial members elected from the House of Representatives. The Governor has a casting vote only. Changes are under consideration to increase the number of members drawn from the House of Representatives and to give them executive responsibility as Ministers for various Departments of Government.

The Legislature consists of two Houses, the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives.

The Legislative Council consists of three ex-officio members, not more than two official members and not less than ten unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The Council elects one of its unofficial members who is not a member of the Executive Council to be its President.

The House of Representatives consists of 32 members elected by adult suffrage from constituencies into which the Island is divided. The House elects a Speaker and also elects five members to serve on the Executive Council.

The policy of land distribution comes under two heads—freehold and leasehold. Appreciable areas of Government-owned lands, with the exception of Forest Reserves, have been disposed of under the existing Land Settlement Scheme, which is a freehold system of tenure. However, in recent years, experiments have been carried out under a leasehold scheme. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

The main heads of direct taxation are: Income tax, land and property tax, death duties—namely, (a) estate, (b) legacy and (c) succession duties—and the licence duty on motor vehicles and on other personal properties. Taxes on real properties are collected on the basis of the improved value. This is defined as the actual present gross value of the property.

Indirect taxation comprises Customs duties, excise duties, entertainment duty and certain licences and fees. Essential foodstuffs are either free of Customs duty or at low rates. Several industries are granted duty-free admission of building materials, plant and equipment.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony:

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1937–38  | 2,476,136  | 2,271,174       |
| 1938–39  | 2,840,142  | 2,854,021       |
| 1945–46  | 7,747,680  | 7,613,612       |

| 1951–52  | 12,922,680*| 13,658,066*     |

* Revised Estimates.

It was estimated that in 1951–52 57·22% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 21·12% from direct taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

Public Debt Charges (6·514%), Education (11·59%), Medical (11·50%), Subventions (9·791%), Public Works (14%), Agriculture and Lands (5·16%).

The Public Debt at the end of March 1952 amounted to £14,055,917 (approximately £9 16s. 8d. per head of population).

British silver and cupro-nickel coins of all denominations circulate freely. Nickel and bronze alloy subsidiary coinage of 1d., ½d., and ¼d. denominations are in circulation. Jamaica Government currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1952, amounted to £3,951,273.

Jamaica received an allocation of £6,250,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. Of this allocation, £250,000 has been utilized towards establishing the University College Hospital, and is therefore not available for ten-year plan financing. The plan, which originally provided for a total expenditure of £19,535,593 over the ten-year period 1946–56, was revised in 1951 and now provides for an expenditure of £18,186,941 over the same period. It is now proposed to spend nearly £12 million between 1951 and 1956, expenditure to be met from the following sources:

| Source                        | Amount (£)   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Colonial Development and Welfare Grant | 3,557,203   |
| General Revenue               | 4,048,953   |
| Loan Funds                    | 4,080,813   |
| **Total**                     | **11,686,969** |

This total is to be spent under the following main heads of expenditure:

| Head                          | Amount (£)   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Agriculture                   | 3,832,393   |
| Education                     | 1,279,339   |

| **Total**                     | **11,686,969** |
In 1952 the Jamaica Government established the Agricultural Development Corporation and the Industrial Development Corporation to stimulate, facilitate and undertake the development of agriculture and industry in the Island. The Government has initiated the Mid-Clarendon Irrigation Scheme to develop some 10,000 acres for agriculture. The Government has also initiated the establishment of Land Improvement Authorities. The first such Authority has been set up in the Yallahs Valley Area in the parish of Saint Thomas. Further Authorities will be set up when the results of this one can be fully assessed.

In 1952, at the Government's invitation, a mission from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development surveyed the development requirements of Jamaica. Its report was presented and published in January 1953.

The development programmes of the bauxite companies, which are not financed from Government funds, are expanding at an increasing pace.

The University College of the West Indies, at Mona, near Kingston, has faculties of Arts, Science and Medicine. In the 1951–52 session there were 204 students. Technical education is available at the Kingston Technical School which had 522 students in 1951. The Government awarded nine scholarships for higher education in 1951, tenable at University College or in the United Kingdom or Canada. There were 26 Jamaicans with scholarships at Universities in the United Kingdom and three in Canada. In addition there were 202 private Jamaican students at Universities in the United Kingdom and 120 in North America. In 1951 there were 27 secondary schools with an enrolment of 7,090 and 706 primary schools with an enrolment of 210,917.

Expenditure on educational services in 1951 was £1,739,791, of which about £69,246 was contributed by the United Kingdom under Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. In 1935 expenditure was £226,392.

During 1951 the Government spent approximately £1,157,470 on its medical services, which are organized on an island-wide basis. This figure excludes the cost of maintenance and the construction of buildings. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £191,207.

There have been no epidemics in the Island for many years, in spite of the serious hurricane which struck the capital, Kingston, in 1951. Disease rates compare favourably with more advanced countries nearby, e.g. the United State of America and Canada. Among the colony's main diseases are: worm infestation (Helminthiasis), yaws, malaria, venereal diseases and pulmonary tuberculosis.

Each of the Island's 14 parishes has a full-time Medical Officer (Health), in charge of public health services, and a staff of sanitary inspectors, public health and district nurses. In the head office in Kingston are specialist officers who are responsible for the various phases of public health activities, which include epidemiology, health education, quarantine and public health nursing and control work in tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws and malaria. There are four mobile health units which carry on a generalized public health programme in different areas.

The following are the government hospitals in Jamaica:

- 21 general hospitals (2,427 beds).
- Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital (170 beds).
- George V Memorial Sanatorium for chest diseases (222 beds).
- Tuberculosis Hospital (190 beds).
- Mental Hospital (2,819 beds).
- Hansen Home for the treatment of leprosy (188 beds).

There are altogether 119 hospital outstations and dispensaries. The figure for out-patient attendance during 1951 was approximately 521,367.

Main airfields are at Palisadoes and Montego Bay and there are four private strips, as well as de-activated fields at Vernam Field and Braco. Palisadoes, a Port of Entry, is used by B.O.A.C., British West Indian Airways, Pan American Airways, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Trans-Canada Air Lines, Chicago and Southern Air Lines, Caribbean International Airways, and numerous non-scheduled operators on international routes. Montego Bay is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American Airways and British West Indian Airways. Meteorological services are provided by the British Caribbean Meteorological Service, and air services are under the control of the Civil Aviation Department. Aeronautical communications facilities are provided by Messrs. International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited.

The Jamaica Government Railway has 240 miles of railway line. The main routes are:

(a) Kingston–Montego Bay.
(b) Kingston–Port Antonio.
(c) Kingston–Frankfield.
(d) Kingston–Linstead.

During the financial year 1951–52, the railway carried 848,833 passengers who paid £82,026, and 405,692 tons of freight from which £230,331 was earned. Over two miles of track have been laid in connexion with the operations of the bauxite companies now operating in Jamaica.

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring. Owing to the configuration of the land there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum gradients are generally 1 in 15. The highest point in the system is the Hardwar Gap through the Blue Mountain at over 4,000 feet. There are 2,583 miles 25½ chains of main roads, of which 737 miles 32½ chains are asphalted, the remainder being of waterbound macadamized surface; and about 4,438 miles of parochial roads, of which approximately 2,137 miles are suitable for motor traffic.

The principal ports are Kingston, Montego Bay and Port Antonio. Regular cargo and passenger services are maintained with the United Kingdom by Messrs. Elders and Fyffes, the Jamaica Banana Producers' Association, the Royal Mail Lines, the Harrison Lines and the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique; with Canada by the Canadian National Steamship Company; with the United States of America by the United Fruit Company and the Alcoa Steamship Company. Bulk cargoes of petroleum products are imported from Trinidad and Aruba. There was a total importation of 601,176·6 tons of cargo during 1951 and exportation of 276,798·2 tons. The total export through the Port of Kingston was 125,339·09 tons.

The Jamaica Broadcasting Company Limited operates a commercial broadcasting service for the Island using short and medium wave with a power of 5,000 watts. The Company also operates a wired rediffusion service in urban and suburban Kingston. At the end of July 1952 there were 2,100 subscribers. It is estimated that the radio
audience is approximately 200,000. Ten per cent of the Company's time is used by the Government of Jamaica and the Company relays several hours per week from the B.B.C.

In 1943 the gainfully employed population was 505,092, the numbers in some occupational groups being:

- Agriculture: 221,376
- Services: 102,441
- Personal: 81,338
- Manufacturing and mechanical: 59,229
- Trade: 38,540
- Retail: 35,205
- Construction: 34,149
- Textile products: 25,673
- Transport: 11,429

Aided by the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Law, the industrial development of the Island has continued. At the end of 1951 the number of registered factories was 685 employing 24,303 persons. As at 31st July, 1952, there were 13 registered trade unions with a total membership of 89,736. The largest, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union, had an approximate membership of 64,859 on 31st March, 1951.

The main crops are sugar cane, bananas, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, pimento, citrus, rice, maize. In 1951, 2,425,749 tons of sugar cane and 5 million 24-lb. bunches of bananas were produced.

Products and manufactures include sugar, cornmeal, condensed milk, margarine, butterine, lard, rum, beer, cigarettes, matches. 459,723,400 cigarettes were made in 1951.

Minerals won are barite, quantities of which are exported for processing—and gypsum, 12,000 and 23,000 tons of which were mined in 1949 and 1950 respectively and processed locally. 2,000 tons of plaster of Paris were manufactured in 1949 and a similar amount in 1950.

The major export crops are handled by the following marketing organizations:

- The Department of Commerce and Industries.
- The Sugar Manufacturers' Association (of Jamaica) Limited.
- The Citrus Growers' Association Limited.

The Commissioner of Commerce and Industries is the sole exporter of bananas, pimento, coffee and cocoa. The prices paid to the growers are determined on the basis of world market prices and the margins of profit allowed to dealers are fixed in consultation with the trade. The Commissioner of Commerce and Industries became the sole exporter of bananas in 1940 as a result of conditions brought about by the war. Prior to that, three shipping companies operated the banana...
export trade, and now act as agents for the Commissioner of Commerce and Industries. Their functions under the present arrangement are to purchase the fruit on his behalf and carry out all loading operations.

The Sugar Manufacturers' Association is an association of manufacturers who pool and market their production. Deductions are made from the export price and applied to price stabilization, rehabilitation and Labour Welfare Funds for the benefit of the industry.

The Citrus Growers' Association are the sole exporters of citrus (other than limes) which is marketed co-operatively for their members.

Two statutory boards, the Coffee Industry Board and the Cocoa Marketing Board, have been appointed and given wide controlling powers with a view to regulating and developing the respective industries. Regulations are now being drafted, under which these Boards will become the sole exporters of coffee and cocoa.

On 31st December, 1951, there were 52 societies with a total working capital of £65,634, registered under the Co-operative Societies' Law. Of these, 36 were credit societies operating principally in urban areas, and eight were marketing societies. These two groups made loans amounting to £67,431, and recovered £41,002 during the year. The value of goods sold in consumer societies was £45,218 and the value of produce marketed through marketing societies was £22,480.

CAYMAN ISLANDS

The Islands form a dependency of Jamaica and consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

At the 1943 census the population was 6,670: Grand Cayman 5,311, Cayman Brac 1,269, Little Cayman 63. Roughly classified according to racial origin 1,052 are of African, 3,518 of mixed and 2,100 of European descent.

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is about 17 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to seven miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

The climate from November to March is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, temperatures range from 60° to 75°. During the summer the range of temperature is some 10° higher and mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1951 was 66.54 inches. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, resulting in considerable depopulation of the latter. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system.

The principal towns are Georgetown and West Bay with populations of 1,462 and 1,866 respectively.

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown, the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1734. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for long a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1774 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 993, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court, Justices of the Peace (at present 27) are appointed
by the Governor of Jamaica, and these, with 27 elected members known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly of Justices and Vestry under the presidency of the Commissioner. The present constitution dates from 1832.

All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

A poll tax of 8s. per adult male between the ages of 16 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 15% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

The following is a table of public finance in the Dependency.

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1937-38 | 17,410     | 16,649          |
| 1938-39 | 13,253     | 11,859          |
| 1946-47 | 31,200     | 28,950          |
| 1947-48 | 34,375     | 31,890          |
| 1948-49 | 40,565     | 34,078          |
| 1949-50 | 36,936     | 38,958          |
| 1950-51 | 62,279     | 49,127          |

In 1950-51 44% of revenue was derived from Customs receipts. The Public Debt as at 31st March, 1952, was as follows:

- Hurricane Loan 1932: outstanding £1,333.
- Public Works Loan, 1932: outstanding £3,143.

Reserve Funds at that date totalled £36,417.

The Islands have benefited to the extent of £75,907 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. This sum has been devoted to the erection of a new hospital on Grand Cayman, to the improvement of educational facilities, road construction, agricultural education, and health measures mainly directed to the destruction and control of mosquitoes. Excellent results have been achieved in all fields except agriculture, which, in a community persistently addicted to the sea rather than to the land, has made only limited progress.

With a view to improvement of communications and the encouragement of the tourist industry, an airfield has been constructed on Grand Cayman financed from the reserve funds of the Dependency, and by a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

During 1952 the Colonial Development Corporation completed and put into operation a cannery on Grand Cayman for processing turtle and manufacturing turtle soup. It is hoped to build up a substantial market in the United States.

There is compulsory free elementary education in 13 Government Schools; expenditure in 1950-51 amounted to £6,130 compared with £1,266 in 1936. Attempts are being made to operate three private Secondary Schools in Grand Cayman, but these receive no financial support from Government at present.

Expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1952 was £6,026, compared with £479 in 1936. The new hospital will have accommodation for 28 patients. Medical Officers are seconded to the Dependency from Jamaica.

A regular three-weekly steamship service is maintained from Kingston to all three islands, and there is a weekly air service between Kingston, Georgetown, and Tampa, Florida, by amphibian aircraft. There is also more or less regular communication with Kingston, Florida and Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels. Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, but no roads exist in Little Cayman. Wireless stations are maintained by Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. There are no broadcasting services.

The chief industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export or conversion to turtle soup. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment on the mainland of America, and in United States and Central and South American ships. Their remittances to their families enable a standard of living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, but no unions have been registered.

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone soil. The main export product of importance is turtle, the value of which in 1951 was £14,726 compared with £2,865 in 1937. The manufacture of thatch rope is the mainstay of the poorer people and forms a considerable export to Jamaica.

| Year | Total Imports (£) | Domestic Exports (£) |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1937 | 27,321            | 10,478               |
| 1938 | 29,555            | 12,737               |
| 1946 | 104,295           | 27,817               |
| 1947 | 122,448           | 20,162               |
| 1948 | 139,491           | 19,241               |
| 1949 | 144,450           | 22,764               |
| 1950 | 202,669           | 35,479               |
| 1951 | 215,172           | 35,653               |

The only marketing organization, the Cayman Turtle Association, Limited, was formed in 1951; it works in close association with the Colonial Development Corporation cannery. There are two small co-operative societies at West Bay and Northside.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

The Turks Islands Bank and the Caicos Bank cover an area of approximately 70 by 50 miles. The total land area is estimated at 166 square miles.
In 1951 the population was estimated at 6,600: Turks Islands 2,175, Caicos Islands 4,425. Of the total, 80 were of European, 4,441 of African and 2,079 of mixed descent.

Geographically the islands are a part of the Bahama chain and have the same flat characteristics, there being no land above 250 feet. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by a 20-mile stretch of ocean water known as the Turks Islands passage; the Caicos Islands are surrounded by a shallow water reef. The islands generally are arid and stony.

The south-east trade winds blow constantly throughout the year, giving an equable and healthy climate. Rainfall is variable and tends to be higher in the Caicos Islands; on Grand Turk the annual average is about 21 inches. The mean annual temperature in 1951 was 79.1°. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1926, 1928 and 1945.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable and Wireless Limited at Grand Turk.

The towns and largest settlement are Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour (South Caicos) and Bottle Creek (North Caicos), with populations of 1,945, 940 and 1,850 respectively.

The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the southern States of America after the War of Independence. After the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, their former slaves remaining in possession. In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, but in 1848 a separate charter was granted to the islands divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas. After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 petitioned Her Majesty that the islands might be annexed to the Colony of Jamaica and from 1874 to the present time they have been one of its dependencies.

During the second world war an anti-aircraft battery was stationed at Grand Turk. In March 1952 the United States Government began the construction there of a Guided Missile Observer Station under an extension of the Bahamas Agreement, and a 5,000-feet asphalt airstrip is expected to be completed by 1953.

An Order in Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica made provision for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. This Board now consists of four official and four unofficial nominated members appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. The Commissioner is ex-officio President of the Board, which has full legislative and budgetary powers, but ordinances require the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming law. Laws passed by the Legislature of Jamaica do not apply to the Dependency unless they are made applicable in express terms. The revenues and expenditure are independent from those of Jamaica.

Much of the land on the salt islands is held on private freehold title. The present policy is to limit grants of Crown land to a 99-year lease.

The main heads of taxation are Customs import duties, royalty on salt and export duties on crawfish and conchs.

The following is a table of public finance in the Dependency:

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1937–38  | 14,359     | 14,660          |
| 1938–39  | 9,780      | 13,830          |
| 1945–46  | 46,994     | 48,255          |
| 1946–47  | 61,701     | 69,945          |
| 1947–48  | 55,225     | 66,773          |
| 1948–49  | 71,132     | 51,810          |
| 1949–50  | 101,477    | 107,040         |
| 1950–51  | 77,297     | 91,588          |
| 1951–52  | 121,767    | 143,213         |

The estimated ordinary revenue and expenditure for 1952–53 are £40,111 and £47,774 respectively. It is hoped to balance the budget by trading profits on sisal.

Up to March 31, 1952, the total assistance approved under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, 1940 and 1945, for the Dependency by way of grant amounted to £152,850, plus an interest-free loan of £50,000 towards the cost of taking over the salt industry from its previous owners. The main heads of expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds up to the end of 1955–56 are estimated to be as follows:

| Head                      | Amount (£) |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Agriculture and Minor Industries | 18,710     |
| Communications            | 17,786     |
| Education                 | 21,965     |
| Miscellaneous             | 8,898      |
| Public Health             | 40,602     |
| Salt Industry             | 81,310     |
| Social Welfare            | 3,062      |
| Water Supplies            | 10,517     |
| **Total**                 | **£202,850** |

Ninety per cent. of the import trade of the Dependency in 1951–52 was handled by the Competent Authority, a department of the Government. The profits on a turn-over of some £130,000 were almost entirely devoted to food subsidization. All food subsidies ceased on 1st April, 1952, and arrangements to convert the Competent Authority's department into a government-owned trading corporation are well advanced. No further government sponsored development is envisaged, and great difficulty is being experienced in meeting the recurrent costs of the developments effected in recent years.

There are 12 Government Elementary Schools and one Senior School in the Dependency. In 1951 the Senior School had an average attendance of 40. There were 1,208 pupils on the rolls of the Elementary Schools and the average attendance was 1,124. Expenditure on education during 1951–52 amounted to £4,000, compared with £840 in 1935.

A 14-bed cottage hospital of modern design has just been completed at Grand Turk, together with a dental clinic. 5,000 cases were treated at the dispensary in 1951. Medical officers, seconded from Jamaica, are stationed at Grand Turk and at East Harbour on South Caicos. There is a maternity clinic at Bottle Creek on North Caicos. Total expenditure on medical services in 1951 was £8,000, compared with £990 in 1935.

There are airfields at Grand Turk and South Caicos. A weekly air mail service operates through Nassau in the Bahamas. There is a monthly mail, freight and passenger service to Jamaica by sea and ships call occasionally from England and the United States.

Grand Turk is an important junction of cables to Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda. A radio
elephone system connects Grand Turk with Salt Cay and the Caicos as well as providing a service with Jamaica and the United States.

Most of the population of the Turks Islands group and of South Caicos are engaged in the production (by solar evaporation) and shipping of salt. The remainder of the Caicos population are mainly fishermen, and do a limited amount of subsistence agriculture. A large proportion of the male population is usually absent from home working in the Bahamas lumber camps, the Inagua salt works or as crews on merchant ships.

Sisal is grown under conditions of peasant agriculture in the Caicos Islands, but the quality is poor, owing to the absence of fresh water for retting and washing. During 1951 about 60 tons were exported. Salt is the main product of the Dependency and the output over the past 25 years has averaged about 43,000 tons annually. Crawfish are exported frozen to Florida, and conchs are sold dried in Haiti.
