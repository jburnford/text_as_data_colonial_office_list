ADEN COLONY

Aden Colony is situated about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia. The area is 75 square miles (exclusive of Perim and the Kuria Muria Islands).

In 1950 the population was estimated at 100,000.

The Colony consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas, joined by a flat sandy foreshore, comprising:

(a) The peninsula on which are situated the main town known as Crater, the modern harbour suburb known as Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased to the Air Ministry for Royal Air Force and military purposes and known collectively as Steamer Point.

(b) The isthmus known as Khormaksar.

(c) An area of land enclosing the modern harbour and extending north and west to the Little Aden Peninsula, the villages of Sheikh Othman, Hiswa, Imad, Buraikha and Fukum (the last two on the Little Aden Peninsula).

The Island of Perim and the Kuria Muria Islands off the Dhufar Coast of Oman also form part of the Colony.

The climate is not unhealthy, though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent, but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

The principal towns are:

| Population |
|------------|
| Aden (including Tawahi, Ma’alla, Khormaksar and Crater) | 71,000 |
| Sheikh Othman | 25,000 |
| The Villages | 4,000 |

The plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden led to the capture of Aden by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company in 1839 under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy.

The need to establish coaling stations on trade routes because of the replacement of sailing ships by steamers was one of the reasons which led to the occupation of Aden by the British. Little Aden was obtained by purchase in 1868. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the Island the same year. It was later re-occupied by the British in January 1857.

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner’s Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden from 1st April, 1937.

The Executive Council of the Colony consists of the officers lawfully discharging the functions of Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed by Her Majesty or as the Governor may appoint in pursuance of instructions from Her Majesty or as the Governor may provisionally appoint in the manner provided in the Royal Instructions. Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, which was brought into force from the 24th October, 1946, a Legislative Council was constituted for the Colony of Aden. It consists of the Governor as President, four ex-officio members, no more than four official members and no more than eight unofficial members.

Under the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1945, the Governor is empowered to lease or otherwise alienate in Her Majesty’s behalf any Crown Land for building, agricultural or any other purpose, on any terms and conditions, as he may think fit.

Aden is a free port and there is no general Customs tariff, but taxes are levied on alcoholic liquor, tobacco and motor spirit. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for the payment of a graduated income tax.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| £       | £           |
| 1937–38 | 168,945     | 127,273     |

†Approved Estimates.

In 1951–52 £663,561 of revenue was derived from Income Tax and £295,206 from Customs and Excise. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

| £       |
|---------|
| Social Services | 240,837 |
| Public Works    | 368,621 |
| Development     | 226,598 |

The currency in circulation is the East African Shilling, issued by the East African Currency Board. It is issued in denominations of 100s., 20s., 10s., and 5s. notes and 1s., 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent coins.

Aden Colony has been granted an allocation of £300,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. In a revision of the development programme in 1951 it was estimated that the amount needed to complete approved schemes was £1,843,420. In addition to the approved schemes there are new schemes which total some £4,000,000. A Development Fund has been created through which it is proposed to finance the remainder of the approved schemes and new schemes for which finance can be obtained.

Of the approved schemes the total is to be spent in the following proportions:

| £       |
|---------|
| Basic Services | 534,417 |
| Social Services | 1,064,800 |
| Productive Services | 1,161,350 |
Basic Services.—£334,417 of the total will be spent on buildings and £200,000 on roads.

Social Services.—£625,000 of the total will be spent on medical and health services and £389,800 on education.

Productive Services.—The entire amount is to be spent on electricity and water supply and a new telephone exchange, for which loan funds are to be applied.

Education in Aden Colony is under the control of a Director, who also advises in both the Eastern and Western Protectorates. In 1952 there were in the Colony some 3,300 pupils (2,400 boys and 900 girls) in Government schools, some 2,700 (2,000 boys and 700 girls) in grant-aided schools, and some 1,100 (900 boys and 200 girls) in recognized private schools. In addition there are numerous unrecognized groups of children attending Koranic schools. The educational system consists of four years of primary, three years of intermediate and four years of secondary schooling. Secondary education is almost entirely in the hands of Government, which has recently opened the Technical College where courses in carpentry and joinery, cabinet-making, machine-shop engineering, and automobile engineering are given, and the Aden College which takes boys as far as the General Certificate of Education. These two colleges have been erected at a cost of about £250,000. Girls' education is taken as far as the intermediate stage which is followed by one- and two-year courses of training for teachers. The teacher training section for men is housed at Aden College; in addition to new entrants, teachers are withdrawn for training from Government and aided schools.

There are at present 14 men and women on scholarships, 12 in the United Kingdom and two in the Sudan.

Amenities for the teaching profession include a monthly newspaper, an annual vacation course, and a club with a library of 2,000 volumes. The Lake Library (9,000 volumes) for the use of the public was taken over by the Department upon the departure of the British Council in 1951.

The recurrent expenditure on Colony education has risen from £6,600 in 1936 to £127,000 in 1952. During that period some £300,000 has been spent on capital works.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1951–52 was £159,918, compared with £13,230 in 1936.

Beds available:
- Civil Hospital . . . . 350
- Maternity Clinic . . . . 50
- Infectious Diseases Hospital . . . . 31
- Mission Hospital . . . . 60

In-patients at Government Hospitals totalled 5,730, out-patients totalled 163,443. There were three Government and two private charitable dispensaries at which 65,148 cases were treated, 13,344 of them at the Government dispensaries.

A Civil Airport has been constructed within the limits of the Royal Air Force Aerodrome at Khormaksar. Regular and reliable services are available to all the surrounding territories. There are regular air services between Aden and the United Kingdom.

The Colony has a total of 74·27 miles of roads, of which 56·07 are bituminous macadam roads.

The vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and the number of vessels, exclusive of country craft, which entered the Port of Aden during 1951 was 4,584 with a tonnage of 19,903,456. The number of country craft which entered the Port during the same period was 1,816 with an aggregate tonnage of 145,916. There are 19 first-class berths, including 11 oil berths suitable for large vessels; five second-class berths, including one oil berth suitable for vessels of medium size; eight third-class berths suitable for small vessels. The oil berths are connected to the land installation by submarine pipeline; all berths are available for the supply of bunker coal and general purposes. The approach channel and the major portion of the mooring basin is dredged to 36 feet.

Of the estimated male labour force 15 per cent. are directly engaged in Port activities such as bunkering, handling and transhipment of cargo, ship repairing and dhow building and the duties performed by pilots, crews of harbour vessels, light keepers and so forth. The cleaning, sorting and packing for re-export of hides, skins, coffee, licorice and gums are occupations of considerable importance. Approximately 2,000 men and women are engaged as casual labour in these trades.

There is no agriculture in the Colony and the only local product is salt. This industry employs some 1,250 workers. Production in 1949, 1950 and 1951 was 303,432, 255,865 and 304,300 tons respectively.

There is a primitive, inshore fishing industry. The catch is mostly pelagic fish; it is sold both to the fresh market and to the salt fish exporters.

There are some small private factories, employing about 400 persons, which produce soap, aluminium domestic utensils, tiles and cigarettes and which dye and print cloth. These, and small producers of cloth by handloom, supply the local demand and provide for export to adjoining territories.

The following is a table of the Colony's total import and export trade:

| Year | Imports (£) | Exports (£) |
|------|------------|------------|
| 1937 | 5,346,928  | 3,134,645  |
| 1938 | 5,310,075  | 2,680,591  |
| 1946 | 15,503,584 | 7,117,213  |
| 1947 | 24,698,050 | 12,621,979 |
| 1948 | 27,298,623 | 12,894,942 |
| 1949 | 32,753,355 | 14,609,629 |
| 1950 | 41,838,218 | 19,352,449 |

Apart from the export of salt, the bulk of the trade of Aden falls into two main classes, namely, entrepôt and transhipment. The raw produce of neighbouring countries is transhipped at Aden to consuming countries in the vicinity. The salient features of the import trade are repeated in the export figures, as the bulk of imports are re-exported or sold in Aden for consumption outside. The principal business is in skins, hides, coffee, cotton piece-goods, cotton yarns, dates, grain, pulse and flour, sugar, tea, spices, oils, tobacco, gums, shells and salt.

PROTECTORATE

The total area is approximately 112,000 square miles, including the Island of Socotra. The Protectorate is divided into Western and Eastern Areas.
The estimated population is:

Western Area : : : : 450,000
Eastern Area : : : : 350,000

800,000

The Aden Protectorate is bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen, and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges, about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains, over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Empty Quarter with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate also has a littoral belt, which is backed by a rock plateau rising to a height of 6,000 feet and continuing inland for about 100 miles, where it breaks up into a system of wadis, some fertile, leading into the main Wadi Hadhramaut. Beyond, to the north, are the sands of the Empty Quarter.

The altitude, which ranges from sea level up to 8,000 feet, is responsible for considerable variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. On the coastal plain torrid tropical conditions of great heat and humidity exist in the summer months. During the same period in the mid-altitude zones it is hot but less humid, while at the highest altitudes the climate is warm and temperate but can in the winter be extremely cold. The whole area falls within the influence of the northeast and south-west monsoons. Rainfall in the coastal areas averages approximately two inches a year; in the most favoured areas of the Western Aden Protectorate highlands it may average ten inches. In general, rainfall decreases from west to east until, in the north-east section, conditions of extreme aridity are encountered.

Mukeiras, a hill station on the Audhali plateau at 7,200 feet, is being developed as a summer resort for people seeking a respite from the heat of Aden.

For a time in the eighteenth century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana’a in the Yemen and several of the rulers of the tribal districts were the Imam’s “wakils” or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with Her Majesty’s Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being the Audhali Sultan in 1914.

In July 1915, during the first World War, the Turks, who had conquered the Yemen in the course of the previous century, occupied the Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts of the Protectorate until the Armistice of 1918.

In 1934 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Her Majesty’s Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen. There was an Exchange of Notes in 1950 when it was agreed to establish reciprocal diplomatic missions and to set up a Frontier Commission.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa’i Sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala) entered into closer relations with His Majesty’s Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. Similar treaties were signed by the Upper Aulaqi Sheikh and the Audhali Sultan in 1952. Early in 1952 the newly elected Sultan of Lahej accepted a Political Officer as adviser.

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri Sultans and the rise of the Qu’aiti—a new Yafa’i dynasty which has gained power and wealth from military and other services rendered by its members abroad to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu’aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with Her Majesty’s Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri Sultan made an agreement with the Qu’aiti Sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu’aiti and Kathiri Sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British resident adviser in all matters except those concerning Mohammedan religion and custom. The Wahidi Sultan of Balhaf signed an Advisory Treaty in 1949.

Her Majesty’s Government does not administer the Protectorate directly but the British Political Staff advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas.

In the Western Aden Protectorate the States nominate their own heads, who have subsequently to be recognized by the Governor of Aden. Not all the heads of State and tribal chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery and in several States an efficient administration is now functioning. There are now State Councils in Lower Yafa’, Amiri, Lower Aulaqi, Shaibi, Fadhli, Dathina, Beihan and Upper Aulaqi and there is a Legislative Council in Lahej. For internal security some of the States have tribal guards (some partly paid for by Her Majesty’s Government as a temporary measure) under the joint control of the British Agent and the heads of States. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force known as the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate. They are stationed inland in fixed posts and are paid for and controlled entirely by Her Majesty’s Government.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal States are the Qu’aiti and Kathiri which are administered by their Sultans as constitutional rulers and have State Councils. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the supervision of the British Agent and Resident Adviser, Eastern Aden Protectorate. The island of Socotra is linked administratively with the mainland territory of Qishn under the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra.

Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenous inhabitants. The local State Governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trusts (waqfs). Land settlement is in progress in the Abyan area.
The bulk of revenue collected by the Protectorate States comes from indirect taxes in the shape of Customs, excise and licence dues; in addition tithes are collected on agricultural products.

The following summarize His late Majesty's Government's expenditure in the Western and Eastern Protectorates in recent years:

The Aden Protectorate received an allocation of £500,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards various schemes.

The main development scheme, that in Abyan initiated in 1947, aims to achieve a better use of land and water resources, and has developed at a satisfactory rate in all fields where adequate staff, machinery and materials could be mustered. The scheme is administered by the Abyan Board which contains State and Government representatives and which works in partnership with landowners and owner-occupiers or tenant farmers. Cotton is grown as a main crop and marketed by the Board. An area of approximately 50,000 acres is now controlled for irrigation farming out of an estimated gross area of 100,000 acres.

The Qu'aïti State has three development schemes for the coastal, central and wadi areas covering a total allocation of £139,000, to encourage and develop local industries, mostly agriculture. Similarly the Kathiri State has £23,500 allocated for agricultural development.

Education in the States varies greatly in development, the Qu'aïti State being at present the most advanced. It has a school of six post-primary standards at Gheil Ba Wazir. At Lahej in the Abdali State there is another of similar standard, and an intermediate school to serve the Western Protectorate is just beginning at Zinjibar in the Fadhli State. There are about 300 boys at these schools. Below this level there are 79 primary (or lower than primary) schools with a total of some 5,000 boys. This does not include the little Koranic schools which are found in many places, nor the private schools of strongly religious bias, of which there are more than 20 in the Wadi Hadhramaut alone.

Girls' education is of fairly recent development. There are now four schools following the primary syllabus—two at Mukalla, one at Seiyun and one at Zinjibar—with a total of 280 girls. In addition there are ten girls' schools and one mixed school of a lower level with over 700 girls. More of these are in the Eastern Protectorate.
Thirty-seven students are on scholarships abroad, mostly from the Eastern Protectorate—18 in the Sudan, ten in Egypt, five in Syria and four in Iraq.

Recurrent expenditure on education has risen from £22,000 in 1947 to over £55,000 (£15,300 from Her Majesty's Government) in the present year.

A Health Adviser (Protectorate), first appointed in 1951, is based on Mukalla and is responsible for the health services in both Protectorates. Under him there is a Medical Officer in charge of the services of the Western Aden Protectorate, based on the Keith Falconer Hospital, Church of Scotland Mission, in Sheikh Othman, who, with a nursing sister, tours and controls the 23 dispensaries of the Western Protectorate, outside the Abyan cotton growing area, which are maintained by Her Majesty's Government. In the Abyan cotton growing area the Fadhli and Lower Yafa'i States, in conjunction with the Abyan Board, maintain and administer local health services. The Qu'aiti and Kathiri States in the Eastern Protectorate have their own health services.

A regular air service by Aden Airways is maintained throughout the year between Aden and Mukeiras and Aden, Riyan (18 miles from Mukalla) Al Qatn and Al Ghuraf in the Wadi Hadhramaut.

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate. In the Western Aden Protectorate several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic and in 1951, following penetration into Upper Aulaqi country, a direct road link was established between Aden and Beihan.

There is a coastal road in the Eastern Aden Protectorate running from Reidat al Abdal Wadud in the east through Shihir, Mukalla, Bir Ali and Balhaf to connect with the Western Protectorate. Roads run inland from Shihir and Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut and from near Balhaf to Azzan. The desert between the Wadi Hadhramaut and Beihan is also traversed by motors.

Where no motor cars can yet penetrate the traffic of the country is carried on camel caravans, which still travel to Aden from the Western Aden Protectorate and to Mukalla and Shihir from other parts of the Eastern Aden Protectorate in large numbers. Donkeys are also employed for both passengers and goods. In a few very mountainous areas goods can only be carried by porters.

Sea communications along the coast of the Protectorate are mainly by dhows, some of which have auxiliary engines. Small powered craft and coastal steamers make occasional and irregular visits to Mukalla and Shihir from Aden.

The most important occupation in the Aden Protectorate is agriculture, involving about 90 per cent. of the population; other occupations are fishing, dyeing, weaving, and preparation of hides and skins.

The main crops are sorghum, millet, bulrush millet, wheat, barley, sesame, cotton (long staple,) dates, Hamami tobacco.

The number of 400 lb. bales of cotton produced since the start of the Abyan Scheme is:

| Year | Bales |
|------|-------|
| 1949 | 100   |
| 1950 | 1,587 |
| 1951 | 9,890 |
| 1952 | 6,300 |

A rough estimate of the livestock population is:

- Camels: 80,000
- Cattle: 68,000
- Goats: 855,000
- Sheep: 200,000
- Donkeys: 7,000

The annual catch of wet fish has been estimated at 50,000 tons for a good season. At least 75 per cent. of this is taken in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. Most of the fish is cured for consumption inland and for export to East Africa and the Far East.

The principal imports are grain, flour, rice, dates, sugar, sesame oil, tea, kerosene, spice, cloth, cotton piece goods, tobacco, cigarettes, soap, glassware, etc.

The principal exports are cotton, coffee, skins and hides, lime, Hamami tobacco, cattle, ghee, sheep, goats, fish, etc.

KAMARAN ISLAND

The island of Kamaran in the Red Sea has been in British occupation since 1915. It does not form part of either the Colony of Aden or the Aden Protectorate, but the Governor of Aden is also the Governor of Kamaran under the provisions of the Kamaran Order in Council, 1949. Prior to that date the island was under the control of the Government of India, exercised through the Governor of Aden and a local Civil Administrator, whose designation became Commissioner from 1949-52. He has now been replaced by an Officer in Charge, who administers the island under the control of the Governor.
