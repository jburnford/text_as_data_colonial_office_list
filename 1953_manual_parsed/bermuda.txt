BERMUDA

The "Bermudas" or "Somers" Islands are situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, about 580 miles east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina. Their total area is now about 21 square miles compared with 19 square miles prior to the establishment of naval and military Bases by the Government of the United States. Between 1941 and 1943 certain islands were joined, and other areas, previously water-covered, were filled in and now form a part of the territory occupied by the United States Bases, including a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

The estimated civil population on the 31st December, 1951, was 38,044, of whom 13,646 were white and 24,398 coloured.

The Bermudas may be described as a singular agglomeration of some 300 small islands, submarine sandhills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, about a mile, or less, in width, measuring about 22 miles in length from north-east to south-west, and about 3 miles in width from north-west to south-east. At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern and western sides comprising almost continuous reefs of coral. The main island is about 14 miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands and areas reclaimed for the United States Bases aggregate about 4,280 acres.
The climate has long been celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The mean annual temperature is 70°; the average annual maximum 90°, and the average annual minimum 47°. The coldest month is February, with a mean temperature of 62°, and the hottest is August, with a mean temperature of 80°. The average annual rainfall is 58 inches.

The City of Hamilton, now the capital, with a population estimated at 3,000, is situated on the main island. The town of St. George on the island of St. George was formerly the capital of the Colony. Its population is estimated at 1,500.

The islands were discovered in 1515 by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, but the Spaniards took no steps to form a settlement and the islands were still entirely uninhabited when in 1609 Admiral Sir George Somers' ship *The Sea Venture* was wrecked upon one of the sunken reefs while conveying a party of colonists to Virginia. The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I, but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands", and thenceforward for a considerable time the islands bore that name.

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled in 1684. Since then the Governors have been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of four official and three unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 4,211 electors, the elector's qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240.

With the enactment of the Women's Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

There is no direct taxation. The revenue of the Colony is mostly raised from Customs duties. The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 12s. 6d. on every £100 of real estate and personal property. The corporation of St. George's obtains its revenue in like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100. The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy rates, and under the Liquor Licence Act licensees pay a certain sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

The following is a table of the public finance of the Colony:

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1937 | 476,678    | 410,754        |
| 1938 | 460,002    | 452,072        |
| 1946 | 1,066,101  | 1,021,704      |
| 1947 | 1,455,440  | 1,362,511      |
| 1948 | 1,531,969  | 1,531,762      |
| 1949 | 1,885,547  | 1,706,587      |
| 1950 | 2,009,463  | 1,969,022      |
| 1951 | 2,368,262  | 2,076,796      |

In 1951 £1,742,839 of revenue was derived from Customs duties.

In the same year £450,003 was expended on Personal Emoluments.

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £1,077,145 10s. 0d. were in circulation on 31st December, 1951.

The main development plan is the Reafforestation (Compulsory Powers) Act, 1952, for the clearance of dead cedar trees along the roadsides to a depth of 50 feet, and the replanting of the cleared areas with suitable trees and shrubs. This is a long-term development plan to be spread over a period of at least five years with an estimated annual expenditure of £50,000. The entire cost of the operation is being borne by the Bermuda Government.

A "grow more" citrus campaign was initiated in 1944. To encourage the planting of citrus fruit trees, the Department of Agriculture undertakes to spray and fertilize the trees for the growers at a nominal fee. Nursery trees are also supplied at cost price. During 1951 £2,825 was spent on this service to citrus growers; receipts amounted to £1,749.

Educational facilities in the Colony comprise:

| Type of Course       | No. of Courses | No. of pupils |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Primary              | 32            | 6,700        |
| Secondary            | 10            | 716          |
| Technical and Vocational | 5         | 216          |
| Post-Secondary       | nil           | nil          |

Note.—It is considered advisable to give the number of courses rather than the number of institutions, as one institution may provide more than one type of course.

The approximate number of Bermudian students attending schools, colleges and universities in the United Kingdom is 25 and in Canada and the United States, 500.

Government expenditure on education in 1951 was £308,324, compared with £31,389 in 1935.

The level of health in the Colony is high and Government services are chiefly engaged in preventive measures. The Public Health Department is responsible for the inspection of milk and meat, garbage collection and disposal, rat control, mosquito control, etc. It is also responsible for pre-natal and pre-school health services.

The only hospitals are the King Edward VII Isolation Hospital and a Mental Hospital. The former is privately run, but receives an annual Government grant-in-aid, amounting in 1952 to £100,000. The Mental Hospital is attended by Government Medical Officers and Health Officers. There is no public hospital or Government medical scheme.
During 1951 total expenditure on Health Services was £180,890 compared with £47,890 in 1935.

Pan American Airways and Colonial Airlines maintain a regular service between Bermuda and the United States of America. B.O.A.C. maintain one trip a week between Bermuda and London and three trips a week between Bermuda and the United States. Trans-Canada Airlines stop at Bermuda in each direction on their weekly service from Montreal to Trinidad, returning to Toronto. Trans-Canada Airlines also operate a weekly service to Bermuda from Toronto returning to Montreal. All planes land at the commercial airport at Kindley Field.

The Bermuda Government abandoned the railway late in 1947.

The Colony has 109 miles of roads, of which 80 miles are all-weather and suitable for vehicular traffic.

The Furness Bermuda Line's ship Q.T.E.V. Queen of Bermuda maintains a weekly service between Bermuda and the United States and the Ocean Monarch operates, mostly as a cruise ship, between Bermuda, the United States, Nassau and Havana.

The Pacific Steam Navigation Company passenger liner Reina del Pacifico makes four calls during the year from England and also calls at Bermuda on her return trip from South America. Pacific Steam Navigation Company freighters, "S" ships, which have accommodation for a few passengers, also call at Bermuda from England approximately twice a month. The Royal Mail Line Loch ships call from England about once a month. The Alcoa Line operate approximately two cargo vessels from Canada to the West Indies which call at Bermuda on their outward journey only. There is also a service for freight only by the Alcoa Line from New York calling at Bermuda about every third week.

A broadcasting station (Z.B.M.) operated by the Bermuda Broadcasting Company, Limited, has a transmitting power of 250 watts. Radio licences are not required.

The tourist trade provides employment for a majority of the population. Estimated numbers in the principal occupations are: hotel staff 3,700; office and shop clerks 3,366; farm workers 774; labourers 2,532; transport workers 1,096.

The following trade unions are registered under the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Act, 1946:

The only marketing scheme in operation in Bermuda is the "Planned Production and Marketing Scheme" introduced in 1949 to assist the growers of vegetables to find a suitable outlet for their produce. The growers taking part in the scheme contract to grow a specified acreage of certain vegetable crops. The Department of Agriculture agrees to purchase any produce from the acreage specified at guaranteed minimum prices. In addition to the produce grown on contract the Government Wholesale Agricultural Marketing Centre buys other vegetables, citrus
fruit and bananas. This scheme has undoubtedly assisted the farming community as more farmers are applying to join. During 1951 purchases of agricultural produce at the Wholesale Marketing Centre amounted to £34,975. Receipts from the resale of this produce exceeded £35,000.
