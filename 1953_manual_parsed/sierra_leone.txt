SIERRA LEONE

The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925, South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

The mid-1951 estimate of population was 2,005,000 (Colony 130,000; Protectorate 1,875,000). Twenty-five per cent. of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these, and about 2,000 Europeans and Asiatics, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea-level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which rises to 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.

There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground. Most of the rain falls in the three months July–September. The mean temperature is approximately 80°, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately 10° inland it is approximately 20° on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25–30% inland.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government". This
portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

Royal Instructions of 1951 provide for an Executive Council of four ex-officio members and not less than four unofficial members appointed from among the elected members of the Legislative Council. An Order in Council of 1951 provides for a Legislative Council consisting of 32 members, including the Governor (who is President) and a Vice-President. There are seven ex-officio members, seven members elected from the Colony districts, twelve members elected from the Protectorate District Councils, two members elected from the Protectorate Assembly, and two nominated members appointed by the Governor. This Order in Council contains provisions in connexion with legislative procedure which previously were included in the Letters Patent. It does not, however, contain the procedure for the election of members to the Legislative Council. This is now provided for in a local Statute, the Legislative Council (Elections) Ordinance, 1951.

With regard to the Protectorate, in 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation of Chiefdoms in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities were vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations and from grants made by Government and by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board.

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding 50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

There are three forms of direct taxation in force: income tax, poll tax, and house tax. Income tax was chargeable on individuals in 1952–53 at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man was granted £300, and a married man £500 as an initial relief. Companies paid a flat rate of 9s. in the £ and an arrangement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government for the avoidance of double taxation. Poll tax is payable by non-natives at the rate of £4 a year and is offset against an individual's liability for income tax. A house tax of 5s. a year is payable in the Protectorate by all adult native males, and a Settler's Fee of £1 by non-natives.

The two main forms of indirect taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duties.

The following is a table of public finance:

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1937 | 1,025,709  | 919,266        |
| 1938 | 886,149    | 910,077        |
| 1946 | 2,195,474  | 1,833,483      |
| 1947 | 2,109,500  | 2,119,500      |
| 1948 | 2,648,983  | 2,172,031      |
| 1949 | 2,730,340  | 2,457,661      |

| 1951 | 3,850,713  | 3,904,374      |

In 1951, 46·65% of total revenue was derived from Customs and 29·49% from taxes. In the same year, the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: 14·83%
- Public Works: 18·37%
- Administration: 4·95%
- Development Schemes: 16·01%

The Public Debt at the end of December 1951 amounted to £3,448,841 (approximately £1 15s. 4d. per head of population) and comprises:

- Sierra Leone Government 41% inscribed Stock 1955: £57,825
- Sierra Leone Government 44% inscribed Stock 1955: £202,500
- Sierra Leone Government 44% inscribed Stock 1955: £151,100
- Sierra Leone Government 34% inscribed Stock 1954: £306,834
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1958–63: £570,000
- Sierra Leone Government 3% inscribed Stock 1968: £81,425
- Sierra Leone Government 3% inscribed Stock 1968: £49,157
- Sierra Leone Government 3¾% inscribed Stock 1968–70: £2,030,000

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ¼d. In addition bronze coins are now being introduced. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.
"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946. The Plan provided for the development of the following three main services at a total cost of £5,256,575 in the ten-year period:

| Service                          | Cost (£)   |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Communications                  | 1,155,500  |
| Development of Natural Resources | 1,015,000  |
| Social and Basic Services       | 3,086,075  |

£5,256,575

As a contribution towards this expenditure, an allocation of £2,600,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 was made.

Owing to difficulties in obtaining the requisite supervisory staff and materials it was not possible to work strictly to the outline plan referred to above, and a comprehensive review of the economic potentialities of the country was therefore undertaken in 1949 and "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was produced and published. The purpose was to indicate the measures necessary to achieve a substantial increase in economic production in the next five years. The Plan envisaged the expenditure of £5,000,000 to be raised by loans, as and when required, to finance the following projects:

| Project                                      | Cost (£)   |
|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Deep Water Quay                              | 1,350,000  |
| Railway                                      | 1,250,000  |
| Roads and Bridges                            | 800,000    |
| Inland Waterways                             | 20,000     |
| Civil Airport at Lungi                       | 165,000    |
| Freetown Electricity Supplies                | 550,000    |
| Guma Valley Hydro-Electric Scheme            | 500,000    |
| Water and Electricity Supplies in the Protectorate | 300,000 |

£4,935,000

Under the provisions of the Development of Industries (Assistance) Ordinance, 1946, the Government has established the Development of Industries Board. This Board may grant loans, either with or without interest or security, from monies voted for the purpose by Legislative Council, which may not in aggregate exceed £10,000 in any one year, to assist in the establishment of new, or the development of existing, industries which, in the view of the Board, will contribute to the economic development of Sierra Leone. Since the inception of the Board loans totalling £20,768 have been granted for the establishment or extension of certain industries including the manufacture of soap, mineral water, furniture and boot and shoe making, weaving and spinning, fishing, rice-milling and nut-cracking, timber-sawing, motor repairing and market gardening.

University courses in Divinity, Arts and Commerce are provided at Fourah Bay College (University of Durham), Freetown. At the beginning of 1951–52 session, 122 students were in attendance at these courses. Thirty scholarships for higher education were awarded in 1951 (11 for study overseas, six for degree courses and 13 for General Certificate of Education courses at Fourah Bay College). Forty Sierra Leone scholarship students and about 200 Sierra Leone private students were known to be studying in the United Kingdom. About 50 private students were known to be studying in the United States of America.

There are three Teacher Training Colleges and two Teacher Training Departments in the territory; 345 students were in training in 1951.

There are two Government Secondary Grammar Schools, two Government Secondary Central Schools and nine assisted Secondary Schools in the territory; 2,749 students were enrolled in 1951. There are also two unassisted Secondary Schools, which had 208 pupils. Five Government, 183 assisted and 101 unassisted Primary Schools had an enrolment of 37,297 pupils.

Literacy campaigns were conducted by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in 15 chiefdoms and 1,429 reading certificates were issued during 1951.

Expenditure from all sources on education was approximately £371,500 in 1951 of which £135,000 was contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and £67,000 by the Missions. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £38,518.

Expenditure on medical and allied services in 1951 was £246,816 from Colony resources and £38,690 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. By comparison expenditure in 1935 was £63,923. In 1951 beds available in hospitals (including maternity homes) totalled 1,100 (Government 830, Missions 196 and Mining 74). In-patients at Government hospitals totalled 7,377 and out-patients 409,806. There were 31 rural dispensaries at which 145,705 new cases were handled.

Special measures to control malaria, yaws and sleeping sickness are undertaken by Government.

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the only international airport in the territory and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Air services are operated through Freetown Airport by West African Airways Corporation which connect Sierra Leone to the other three British West African territories and provide a twice-weekly service to the United Kingdom connecting with the B.O.A.C. South American trunk route at Dakar. Other operators using Freetown are Air France and, occasionally, Transporte Aeros Portugese. Meteorological services are available and are a part of the British West African Meteorological Service with headquarters at Lagos.

The railway carried 1,214,951 passengers and 114,725 tons of freight in 1951. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 315. This mileage included a branch line covering a distance of 82½ miles. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 57½ miles.

There are 2,212 miles of road (1951)—bituminous surface 95 miles, gravel or earth surface, 2,117 miles.

Freetown is a port of British Shipping Registry, four miles up the Sierra Leone River and has one of the finest harbours in Africa. Smaller ports are at Pepel, Bonthe and Sulima. Freetown handled 1,386,702 and 1,476,983 tons of shipping in 1950 and 1951 respectively. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines; Bonthe and Sulima are loading ports for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piassava. Passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and Palm Line, Limited, and to the Continent by Holland West Africa Line. A limited cargo service to the east coast ports of America is provided by Elder Dempster Lines,
Limited, and the Barber Steamship Lines, and to South Africa by J. P. Holmen, Limited, and Elder Dempster Lines, Limited.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and Bonthe River to the south.

There is no direct broadcasting, but Government operates a wired broadcasting system in Freetown to which there were 2,503 subscribers in August 1952. In the same month the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 568. The operation and maintenance of the station is in charge of the Posts and Telegraphs Department while the rediffusion programmes are arranged by the Public Relations Department. This Department also issues the publication "Weekly Bulletin" which has a circulation of 5,000.

It is estimated that over half the population are engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups as follows:—Building and construction 11,434; mining 7,486; transport (road, rail and air) 3,930; maritime and waterfront 4,781; Army and Navy services 1,624; commercial and miscellaneous 3,579; Government and Native Administration (excluding workers in other groups) 12,344. Smaller employers provide employment for an estimated additional 30,000 workers of whom a large proportion are domestic servants. The total number of workers in wage-earning employment is therefore approximately 80,000.

There were at the beginning of 1952, 11 registered workers' unions with a total membership of 16,659.

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piassava, rice, cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, cassava, bennised, kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: cattle 69,000, goats 21,000, sheep 10,000, pigs 4,000.

Inshore fishing is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown. Trawler fishing, operated by Government, has not proved successful and the venture has been closed down. The West African Fisheries Research Institute has a station at Kissy, near Freetown. Their research trawler Cape St. Mary is operated from this station.

The chief minerals are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Gold is also found, mainly by dredging. There are also deposits of ilmenite.

Seven pioneer oil mills for the expressing of palm oil are operated by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board. An oil-expressing plant for the production of groundnut and kernel oil is expected to be in operation by mid-1953. It will be operated by Government. A hammer-mill will be incorporated in the plant to produce pig feed. Government operates one small and two large rice mills and there are a few privately owned mills, all on a small scale. Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise. A privately owned soap factory produces approximately 100 tons of soap per year and is also being fitted with a "glycerine" recovery plant. Village industries include weaving, hand methods of expressing palm oil, and cracking of palm nuts to obtain the kernel.

The chief imports are cotton piece goods, artificial silk manufactures, cement, machinery, iron and steel and manufactures, petroleum products and unmanufactured tobacco.

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up under Ordinance No. 1 of 1949, the objects being to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchase, marketing and export of Sierra Leone produce, and to assist, by all possible means, in the development of the agricultural industry in Sierra Leone and of secondary industries connected with it. To this end the Board has erected seven pioneer mills for the extraction and processing of palm oil.

On 30th April, 1951, there were 43 Co-operative Societies, with 3,125 members and subscribed capital of £2,576. Government authorized the advance of up to £2,000 in loans to Co-operative Societies.
