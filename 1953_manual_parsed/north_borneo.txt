NORTH BORNEO

The territory, which includes the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo, is divided into three Residencies: East Coast, 16,345 square miles; Labuan and Interior, 7,648 square miles and West Coast, 5,195 square miles (total 29,388 square miles).

The population was 334,141 at the 1951 census. The native population numbered 243,009, the Chinese 74,374, the Europeans (including Eurasians) 1,213.

Central mountain ranges from 4,000 to 10,000 feet in height, rise somewhat sharply from low hills nearer the coast and culminate in Mount Kinabalu (13,455 feet) the highest mountain in the East Indies. The coastline is formed mainly of alluvial flats, with many creeks and swamps. Hills and valleys in most cases are covered with dense forest and there are many rivers. The most extensive plain is that on the east coast, irrigated by the river Kinabatangan and its tributaries, believed to contain some 4,000 square miles of rich and fertile soil. In the interior are found the Keningau and Tambunan plains which are traversed by the Pegalan River. The Keningau plain consists of wide stretches of grassland, while Tambunan maintains a large padi-planting population.

Labuan, which now forms part of the colony, is an island, 35 square miles in area, lying 6 miles off the mainland. It has an excellent, well-sheltered harbour.

The climate is relatively cool for a place situated so near the equator. The rainfall and mean temperatures are as follows:

|                | Maximum Rainfall (inches) | Minimum Rainfall (inches) |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Jesselton      | 88°                       | 72°                      | 91·89                    |
| Sandakan       | 88°                       | 75°                      | 122·66                   |
| Tambunan (situated in the high land in the interior) | 86°                       | 66°                      | n.a.                     |

Humidity is relatively high in most places although there are a few comparatively drier belts. The wet season extends from October to February but the rain is not incessant. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and continues to the middle of April; the south-west monsoon lasts from April till October. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt. The main towns are situated on the coast, and all have good harbours:

Early in the sixteenth century the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued, and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. British and American traders endeavoured to get a firm footing in North Borneo, but it was not until 1847 that Labuan was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei. In 1872, after protracted negotiations, a large area on the mainland was ceded by the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory, and was made in perpetuity. In November 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Provisional Association, Limited, which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in 1882. This Company governed British North Borneo until January 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September 1945, and was under military administration until 15th July, 1946, when it became part of the new Crown Colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate colony from 1846 until 1890 and later as a settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new Colony of North Borneo, on the same date under the Labuan Order in Council.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent under which a governor and commander-in-chief of the Colony is appointed. Under this instrument full sovereign rights are assumed over British North Borneo, following the North Borneo Cession Order in Council. The three instruments bear the date 10th July, 1946.

Authority was given under Letters Patent of 1950, for the establishment of a Legislative Council and Executive Council in and for the colony, in place of the Advisory Council which had existed hitherto, and an Order in Council brought into force on the 17th October, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council. It is presided over by the Governor and consists of three ex-officio members, nine official members and ten nominated members. The Executive Council consists of three ex-officio members, two official members and four nominated members.

Government's policy is to protect the interests of natives, who are given grants in perpetuity instead of leases for limited periods up to 99 years. There are two forms of land tenure: leases available to all, and Native Titles available to natives (who include all aboriginal inhabitants). No lease for town land may be for more than 99 years. The area opened up by natives (excluding village reserves) is approximately 128,695 acres, almost all on individual title. All unalienated land is the property of the Crown.

The two main forms of direct taxation in force are income tax and residents' tax. The scope of income tax is restricted to companies incorporated or registered in the colony or elsewhere and the rate of tax payable is 30%. With effect from 1st January, 1950, an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom Government for the avoidance of double taxation. The residents' tax legislation provides for all residents whose annual taxable incomes exceed $3,000 to pay tax
ranging from 1% on incomes in excess of $3,000 to 12% on those exceeding $100,000.

A poll tax of $1.50 per annum is paid by natives who do not pay to Government $3 or more annually by way of rent or boat or fishing licences.

The other main source of taxation is Customs import and export duties. The highest general rate on imports is 30% ad valorem on motor vehicles, the preferential rate being 10%. Manufactured goods are usually charged 10% and textiles and clothing 15% with a preferential rate of 7½%. The free list includes essential food-stuffs, building materials, and passengers' personal and household effects. Essential machinery and plant of British manufacture is also free of duty. The majority of goods exported are dutiable; 10% of the f.o.b. value is an average charge, but certain items are given special attention, e.g. rubber is charged 5% on the first $30 per pikul, 10% on the next $5 per pikul and 15% on the balance, allowance being made for freight, handling charges, etc. In addition a cess of ¼ cent per lb. is levied on all rubber exported, this revenue being utilized for the development of the rubber industry. Most of the timber exported is charged a royalty, but other timber is charged export duty in accordance with the Timber Roll.

From the re-establishment of civil government following the liberation from Japanese occupation in July 1946, to the end of 1951, local revenue was in excess of recurrent expenditure. (Grants-in-aid totalling $16,642,858 and loans-in-aid amounting to $2,057,142 were provided by His Majesty's Government up to the end of 1951 for purposes of reconstruction.) In addition grants-in-aid totalling $4,700,000 have been made for ex-gratia war damage compensation.

| Ordinary Revenue(a) | Total Expenditure |

*Revised estimates.

(a) Excluding grants-in-aid, loans-in-aid, and Colonial Development and Welfare Grants.

(Expenditure excludes war damage compensation and Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes. The 1952 expenditure figure includes a non-recurrent item of $3.4 millions for buying up existing timber rights.)

The principal sources of revenue in 1952, expressed in millions of dollars, were estimated to be Customs 12·10, licences and internal revenue 3·36, forests 1·23.

The currency in circulation consists mainly of Malayan currency, which was introduced by the British Military Administration immediately after the liberation of the territory, with a small quantity of British North Borneo Chartered Company notes and coin issued before the Japanese occupation. Chartered Company currency still remains legal tender but when handed into banks or offices of the Treasury it is redeemed at its face value for Malayan currency. The buying and selling rates of the Malayan dollar fluctuate slightly in accordance with the Singapore market. For the purpose of conversion to sterling, the value of a dollar is taken at 2s. 4d.

A plan covering the reconstruction and development of North Borneo up to 1955 was drawn up in 1947 and totalled $19,138,989 for reconstruction and $28,382,375 for development. This plan was revised in 1950 and was linked to the Colombo Plan, the present position being that the total estimated cost of reconstruction will be $34,702,963 and for development, up to 1957, $74,168,949. The cost of reconstruction is being met mainly from Colony revenues with assistance from Her Majesty's Government in the form of a grant-in-aid. Up to the present $857,143 have been provided by Her Majesty's Government for this purpose. The financing of the development costs will be carried out with assistance from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, loans, Colony surpluses and assistance from E.C.A. The provisional amount allocated to North Borneo from Colonial Development and Welfare funds is $20,357,143. The development programme is made up as follows:

|                          | $     | %    |
|--------------------------|-------|------|
| Agriculture and multi-purpose projects | 26,468,511 | 35·7 |
| Transport and Communications | 23,423,983 | 32·0 |
| Mining                   | 199,586 | 0·3  |
| Social Services          | 24,076,869 | 32·0 |

Under Agriculture the money will be spent on irrigation schemes, experimental stations, soil surveys, mechanical rice cultivation and livestock disease control. Under Transport and Communications improvements to the railway and the building of new roads, to open up new agricultural areas and improved communications around the main centres, are proposed. Under Social Services a new Teachers' Training College, new hospitals, housing, town planning, water supplies and reclamation are planned.

Over and above work being undertaken by Government, the Colonial Development Corporation, in partnership with a local firm, are developing ex-Japanese hemp and rubber estates on the east coast.

In July 1952, the original timber concession which covered some 80% of the forest of the country, and which had existed for many years was terminated, and a number of companies will now undertake logging operations on new concessions under the control of the Forest Department.

Primary education in the Colony is provided by four categories of schools; (1) schools maintained by Government, (2) Mission schools aided by block grants, (3) Chinese schools maintained by local Chinese communities, and (4) private and estate schools. The total school population is 21,388, compared with 10,485 in 1939. The number of Government schools has
increased from 48 in 1941 to 71 in 1952. All are in the primary stage (six years) and are designed by suitable curricula to meet the needs of an agricultural community. There are 17 Secondary schools with an enrolment of 650 children. The pupils in the Secondary schools are for the most part Chinese and future policy will aim at providing secondary education for children of all races in more equal proportions. A Teachers' Training College was opened in 1952 with accommodation for 96 students. Training in woodwork is available at the Government Trade School and the curriculum is to be extended to include a course in metalwork.

Government expenditure on educational services in 1951 amounted to $790,276 (of which $372,276 was contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds).

There are 11 hospitals with a total of 835 beds. Subordinate to each hospital are the dispensaries, of which there are 32. These are situated in the outlying districts and provide medical care and first-aid treatment to the smaller communities. They are staffed by senior dressers, who are under the supervision of the medical officer, and draw their supplies of drugs and other requirements through him.

There is a mental hospital at Sandakan and a leper settlement on Berhala Island near Sandakan, which accommodates all lepers from the Colony. There are at present 57 in the settlement.

A health visitor is responsible for the supervision of the training and work of native midwives. A midwives' hostel is maintained, and after a hospital training and practical work in the districts under the health visitor, the pupils are returned to their villages as trained village midwives.

Expenditure on all medical services in 1951 was $1,099,278.

There are airfields at Jesselton, Sandakan and Labuan. External services are provided by Malayan Airways from Sarawak and Singapore, Cathay Pacific Airways from Manila and Hong Kong, Qantas Empire Airways from Australia and Hong Kong, Air France from Indo-China and New Caledonia and Garuda Indonesian Airways from Djakarta and Manila. An internal feeder service is planned linking Labuan, Keningau, Ranau, Jesselton, Sandakan, Lahad Datu and Tawau.

Over half a million passengers were carried on the railway in 1951, and the weight of freight hauled reached the record total of 35,450 tons. The total length of the railway, which is of metre gauge, is 116 miles.

There are 144 miles of metalled roads with bitumen-sealed surface; 91 miles of other metalled roads; 146 miles of earth roads, and 603 miles of bridle paths.

The chief ports are Labuan, Sandakan, Jesselton, Kudat, Tawau and Lahad Datu. Thirteen shipping lines run services to and from the Colony as well as numerous other miscellaneous chartered vessels loading timber at Labuan and east coast ports. Coastal shipping includes a regular feeder service to all ports in the Colony, Brunei and Sarawak by five North Borneo-based Straits Steamer Company vessels, apart from the main line vessels, together with some 600 small craft.

Nearly 2½ million gross tons of shipping used the ports of the Colony in 1951 and the quantity of cargo handled was over 580,000 tons.

An experimental broadcasting station has been established ("Radio Sabah") which provides a regular lunch-time broadcast including news items in Mandarin, Hakka, Malay and English. Plans are in hand for setting up a more adequate service with assistance from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. There are some 2,000 licence holders.

The 1951 census showed that 82,998 persons were engaged in smallholding agriculture, the bulk of whom were natives engaged in padi planting on their own account. Figures for other occupations were: rubber production 20,331; commerce 6,037; fishing 5,452; Government services (not including Railway Department) 4,223; timber 3,637; coconut, copra and coconut oil production 3,373; transport and communications 2,345; firewood and cutch 1,821; building 1,642.

The main crops are rubber, coconuts, rice and hemp.

The estimated livestock population is: pigs 62,690; buffalo 53,157; cattle 11,402; goats 7,383; sheep 50.

The total output of timber in 1951 amounted to 7,112,725 cubic feet. The volume of logs exported was 3,701,926 cubic feet, and of sawn timber 362,698 cubic feet. The total export expressed as round timber equivalent was 4,318,311 cubic feet, with a total value of $10,146,681.

Investigations are being carried out into the possibility of increasing fish production and several concerns have already shown an interest in deep-sea fishing off the North Borneo coasts. A total of 1,253 tons of marine products valued at $1,032,332 was exported during 1951.

A geological survey is being undertaken by a team of experts to determine the mineral wealth of the country and a large oil company is prospecting for oil.

| 1951 | ...              | 70·2              |

There is also a considerable transit trade along the whole coast of the colony, the total value of which was estimated to have been about $35,000,000 in 1951.

In 1951, 66% of the total exports went to Asia, 21% to the United Kingdom, 8% to Europe, 2% to the U.S.A., 2% to Australia and 1% to other countries.

In 1951, 25% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 25% from Australia, 18% from Europe, 29% from Asia, 1% from the U.S.A., and 2% from other sources. The corresponding percentages in 1950 were 20%, 25%, 18%, 34%, 1%, and 2% respectively.
