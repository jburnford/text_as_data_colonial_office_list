MAURITIUS

The area of Mauritius is approximately 720 square miles, that of Rodrigues 40 square miles and the area of the Lesser Dependencies, viz., the Chagos Archipelago (the largest islet is Diego Garcia), Agelega and the Cargados Carajos or St. Brandon Isles, approximately 47½ square miles.

The population is: Mauritius 495,000; Rodrigues 15,000; and Lesser Dependencies 2,000. It is divided into three groups: (1) General population (33%) comprising Europeans and descendants of Europeans and people of African and mixed origin; (2) Indo-Mauritian population proper (64%) made up of immigrants from India and their unmixed descendants; and (3) Chinese population (3%) consisting of immigrants from China and their unmixed descendants.

The island lies in the Indian Ocean, 550 miles east of Madagascar. It is chiefly of volcanic formation but almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains, the principal peaks reaching about 2,700 feet. There are numerous rivers and streams; none of them is navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. The land rises gradually from the coasts, and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet.

The south-east trade winds blow during most of the year and the climate is generally humid. The coastal regions are quite warm in summer but the central plateau is comparatively cool all the year round. Rainfall increases from an annual average of about 50 inches at or near sea level, to nearly 200 inches on the highest part of the plateau. There is no real distinction between dry and wet seasons. January to March are the months of greatest cyclonic activity. Tropical cyclones, which usually occur between November and May, affect Mauritius to a small extent in most years but to a serious extent only about once in ten years.

Mauritius was probably first visited by Arab sailors and by Malays during the Middle Ages. During the early sixteenth century Portuguese sailors visited the island several times and the first European to discover it is believed to have been Domingos Fernandez. The Portuguese used it merely as a port of call without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch who landed in 1598 and gave the island the name of Mauritius in honour of their ruler, Prince Maurice of Nassau. The settlement never developed and the island was abandoned in 1710. In 1715, the island was formally taken possession of by the French, but was not actually occupied till 1722 when a small party of colonists were sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The Island was then named Isle de France. From 1722 till about 1767 it was governed by that Company. From 1767 to 1810, apart from the brief period of independence under the Colonial Assembly during the French Revolution, it was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government.

During the long war between England and France, French men-of-war and privateers based on the Isle de France were a source of great mischief to the English merchant vessels. The British Government decided to capture the island and in 1810 a strong British expedition was eventually successful. The former name of Mauritius was then restored to it, and, with its dependencies, including Rodrigues, it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

The Government is vested in a Governor with an Executive and a Legislative Council. In accordance with Letters Patent, Royal Instructions and Order in Council dated the 9th December, 1947, the Legislative Council is composed of three ex-officio, 12 nominated unofficial, and 19 elected members, under the Presidency of the Governor. The Executive Council consists of three officials (the Colonial Secretary, the Financial Secretary and the Procureur-General) and four members selected by the Legislative Council from amongst the non-official members. The Royal Instructions provide for the appointment of other members to Executive Council and, in October 1951, the Governor appointed one elected member and one nominated member to serve for the remaining period of the Council as at present constituted. The tenure of office of appointed members is three years.

Under the new constitution, a British subject, male or female, of 21 years of age or upwards, who has been ordinarily and bona fide resident in the Colony for a period of two years preceding an election, and

(a) can pass a simple literacy test; or
(b) has an armed forces qualification; or
(c) has a business premises qualification;

is entitled to vote, unless debarred under the specific disqualifications listed in section 17 of the Order in Council.

Roughly one-sixth of the area of the island is owned by the Crown and consists of (a) Crown lands proper made up of unconceded lands and lands re-acquired by the Crown, and (b) "Pas Geometriques" being reserved land lying on the sea coast between the high water mark in spring tides and a line drawn parallel to the general contour of the coast at a distance of 81·21 metres. Alienable Crown lands may be sold only by public auction, except in the case of lands required for religious, charitable, educational or for public utility, when a nominal price is charged. The deeds of sale do not alienate the right of the Crown in respect of any mines of precious stones or metals or any layer of mineral oil or the right of the Crown of entering the property for the purpose of mining or of boring and collecting mineral oil, but no other restrictive clause is inserted in the deed of conveyance. Crown lands ("Pas Geometriques" excluded) may be leased by private contract or public auction. Portions of Pas Geometriques not exceeding two hectares may be leased by private contract after publication of notices. In the case of portions exceeding two hectares, the lease must be by public auction.

The remaining five-sixths are privately owned lands of which the holders are free to dispose as they think fit.

Income tax rates for individuals are:

| Chargeable Income | Rate of tax cents |
|-------------------|------------------|
| For every rupee of the first Rs. 5,000 | 10 |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 5,000 | 15 |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 5,000 | 25 |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 10,000 | 40 |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 25,000 | 50 |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 50,000 | 60 |
| For every rupee of the remainder of the chargeable income | 75 |

In ascertaining the chargeable income a number of deductions are allowed.

Company tax is at the rate of 40%.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariff and excise duties.

The following is a table of public finance in the Colony:

| Year     | Revenue Rs. | Expenditure Rs. |

The Mauritius Development and Welfare Ten-Year Plan provides for a total expenditure of Rs. 108,829,500 (£8,162,212) to be financed from the following sources:

I. Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945:

| Source                                      | Rs.       | £         |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| (a) Colony's Allocation                     | 23,333,300| 1,750,000 |
| (b) Other Grants under Central Schemes (Estimated) | 2,611,500 | 195,860   |

II. Local funds

| Source                                      | Rs.       | £         |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
|                                             | 22,384,700| 1,678,852 |

III. Loan funds

| Source                                      | Rs.       | £         |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
|                                             | 60,500,000| 4,537,500 |

This total is to be spent as follows:

- Social Services 26% (Health, Education, Housing Loans).
- Basic Services 24% (Roads, Water supplies, Sewerage).
- Economic 37% (Agriculture, Irrigation and Hydro-electricity, Forestry, Fisheries, Secondary Industries).
- Other [13%] (Administration, Research, Loan interest, Reserve).

Since 1946 costs of materials and labour have increased appreciably and it is accordingly proposed to review the Plan in January 1953.

Mauritius depends entirely on the production of sugar. The possibilities of setting up new industries which would make use of the by-products of sugar are being studied. The production of cement is also under consideration.

There are 274 educational establishments in Mauritius. Of this total, 227 are Primary schools, 46 Secondary and one post-Secondary, with a total of 73,000 pupils. The Government institutions comprise 67 Primary schools, three Secondary schools, one training college for teachers and a College of Agriculture. Nine Secondary and 76 Primary schools within the total given above are State-aided. There are also a number of private day and evening schools teaching such subjects as the Koran, Urdu and Hindi. The development of technical education is under review; at present it is limited to a number of apprenticeships in the Railway Department. The Government awarded 13 scholarships in 1951 for higher education overseas. Mauritians in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Universities numbered 226, of whom 70 were scholarship holders.

A start has been made on adult education by the appointment of an Adult Education Officer, and the launching of public lectures, continuation classes and science extension classes.

In the financial year 1950-51 expenditure on education was Rs. 5,149,258, of which Rs. 455,216 were from Imperial sources. In 1935 expenditure was Rs. 1,347,201.

Since the successful Malaria Eradication Scheme, malaria has ceased to be a disease of economic importance. In 1951 the main causes of morbidity were diseases due to helminths, dysentery, influenza and anaemias.

The health inspectorate works from health offices of which there are 13 throughout the island. The total number of beds available in 1951 was 1,180 in general hospitals, 653 at the Mental Hospital, 210 at the Orthopaedic Centre and 62 at the Leper Asylum. In addition, sugar estates provided 738 beds for the treatment of their employees. There were 45 static dispensaries and four mobile dispensaries. The Maternal and Infant Welfare Service provided ten static centres and one mobile antenatal clinic. Admissions to hospitals numbered 30,747; attendances at dispensaries 476,160.

The expenditure on medical services amounted to Rs. 4,475,201, under the General Estimates and Rs. 1,926,684 under the Development and Welfare Plan during the financial year 1950-51, compared with Rs. 1,283,430 in 1935.

The airport (Plaisance) is run by the Colonial Government and the meteorological services are under the control of the Director, Royal Alfred Observatory. Air France operate a twice-weekly "Constellation" service between Paris and Mauritius through Cairo, Nairobi, Madagascar and Reunion. Qantas Empire Airways operate a scheduled service between Sydney and Johannesburg via Melbourne, Perth, Cocos Islands and Mauritius. No internal services exist.

The railway carried 2,395,264 passengers and 482,209 tons of freight in 1950-51. Track mileage totalled 100·25 plus 9·55 miles of narrow gauge.

There are 700 miles of road, bituminous surface 298·5 miles, gravel surface 401·4 miles.

Port Louis, the capital of the island, is also the only port; it can accommodate ten ocean-going vessels at any one time, and four small vessels. Regular cargo services are provided from the United Kingdom by the Clan Line of steamers, Union-Castle Line and Bullard King Limited and from continental ports by the French companies Messageries Maritimes Limited and Nouvelle Cie Havraise Peninsulaire; a frequent service is also provided by a combined French and Swedish Company, Svedel Lines. Passenger services from the United Kingdom direct to Mauritius are infrequent; the French vessels direct from Marseilles to Mauritius provide the better service. The Dutch Royal Inter-ocean Lines vessels call at Port Louis regularly on their Far East-South Africa-South America service, providing a regular passenger and cargo service to and from South
Africa. During the year 1st July, 1951, to 30th June, 1952, a total of 271 vessels entered Port Louis giving a total nett tonnage of 923,366.

Government runs the Mauritius Broadcasting Service, which has a monopoly in the Colony. The station operates on 220 metres, 1,364 kc/s medium wave and 19·90 metres, 15,075 kc/s short-wave with powers of 5 kw. and 1½ kw. respectively. In June 1952, there were 11,949 wireless licences in force in the Colony, with an estimate of five listeners per receiver. Work has started on a new studio and a new transmitting building in connexion with a scheme of technical improvements.

Cane plantations and sugar manufacture give employment to some 4,000 skilled and some 51,000 unskilled workers. Other industries are tea planting and manufacture, employing some 1,200 workers; tobacco 1,800; aloe fibre 800. The docks give employment to about 1,000 workers; the building trade over 900; Government and public services 10,800.

The main crops are sugar cane, "aloe" (Furcraea) fibre, tea, tobacco, and food crops.

The livestock population at a census in 1950 was: dairy cattle, kept mainly by Indian peasants, 32,100; estate cattle and draught oxen, 8,200; goats, 53,500; pigs, 4,000; sheep, 2,000.

The catch of fish in coastal waters is approximately 2,000 tons a year. The Indian Ocean Trading Company operates one large vessel which fishes the distant banks between Mauritius and the Seychelles.

Approximately 1,000,000 sugar sacks a year are produced at the Government Sack Factory from "aloe" fibre. Cigarettes are manufactured from local and imported tobacco by the British American Tobacco Company (Mauritius) Limited. Coconut oil is extracted from copra obtained from the dependencies known as the Oil Islands, at a factory in Port Louis. The only by-product of sugar cane is alcohol. 99,792 hectolitres were produced in 1951.

The chief imports are grain and flour, edible oils and fats, petroleum products, textiles, machinery and vehicles, iron and steel, coal, cement, and fertilizers.

The whole of the production of sugar which forms the bulk of the export trade of the Colony is at present sold through the medium of the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate to the Ministry of Food in England. All producers thus receive the same price. On the 30th April, 1951, 118 of the 138 agricultural credit co-operative societies had members who marketed sugar cane through the agency of their societies. One ginger marketing society had 284 members.

On the 30th April, 1951, there were 233 registered co-operative societies with 16,830 members. The share capital was Rs. 614,558 and reserve funds were Rs. 471,375.
