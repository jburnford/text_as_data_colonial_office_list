NIGERIA

Of the total area of 373,250 square miles, the Colony comprises 1,381 and the Protectorate 371,869 (including 34,081 in the Cameroons Trust Territory). The country is divided into three Regions whose areas are:—Northern 281,782, Eastern 46,065, Western 45,403 square miles.

A census of the territory is being undertaken in 1952–53 and preliminary results for the Northern Region are available. The full census results are likely to show a total population approaching 30 millions, nearly 17 millions being in the Northern Region, 7 millions in the Eastern and 5 millions in the Western. Apart from about 15–18,000 Europeans, the population is African. In 1931 the sizes of the main tribes were estimated as follows:—

Fulani 10%, Hausa 18%, Ibo 16%, Yoruba 16%.

Half the people in the North were Hausas or Fulani; in the East 62% were Ibos and in the West 65% were Yorubas. Population is densest between Lagos and Ibadan in the West, and around Kano in the North.

Geographically there are four main zones, each stretching across the country from east to west and corresponding closely to the annual rainfall. This falls from as much as 200 inches in the south-east to as little as 20 inches in the north. The four zones are:—

(i) A belt of creeks and mangrove swamps along the coast, which includes the Niger delta. It extends anything from 10 to 60 miles inland.
(ii) A well-watered belt of dense tropical forest from 50 to 100 miles wide. It is rich in oil palms and cacao.

(iii) A belt of park-like land with savannahs of high grass, and largely uninhabited because of tsetse-fly.

(iv) A vast undulating plateau about 2,000 feet high, with occasional hills of granite and sandstone sometimes rising to over 5,000 feet. The northern half of this is free of tsetse-fly, and carries a heavy stock of nomadic cattle. This area also produces groundnuts and cotton.

The Cameroons Mountain (13,350 ft.) is a volcano, and was last active in 1922.

There is a dry season, roughly from November to April and a rainy season, which is longer in the south than the north and later in the east than the west. The wettest months in the north are August and September and in the south, June, July and August. Average annual rainfalls are:—Kaduna 52, Enugu 71, Ibadan 48 inches. The annual average temperature is everywhere about 80°. In the south the temperature varies very little; in the north it may rise as high as 110° but the nights are cool.

Lagos is the capital. The Regional capitals are Kaduna (Northern), Ibadan (Western), Enugu (Eastern). Nearly all the large towns are in the Western Region where there are at least ten towns of over 50,000 population, and two—Ibadan and Lagos—of well over a quarter of a million. In the north, Kano has over 100,000 and Ilorin over 50,000. There are few large towns in the East—only Onitsha, with more than 50,000—and the other large towns such as Enugu and Port Harcourt are mainly artificial settlements.

As far back as the seventeenth century British traders had mercantile depôts on the mouths of the Niger and adjacent rivers and creeks, trade until the nineteenth century being mainly in slaves. Journeys were not undertaken into the interior, however, until the era of exploration which began with the formation in London of an African Association in 1788. The Association directed its attention to solving the mystery of the "Great River" which was known to flow through much of West Africa. Thanks to the journeys of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, it was demonstrated in 1830 that the many rivers flowing into the Bight of Benin were, in fact, the delta of the Niger.

Under the inspiration of MacGregor Laird and others efforts then began to use the Niger as a commercial highway into the interior. They were not on the whole successful, but British and other firms maintained stations in the delta chiefly to trade for palm oil. The energy and vision of Sir George Goldie led to an amalgamation of the British firms into a single company, and the new company developed its trade to such effect that opposing interests were all bought out. At the Berlin conference in 1885 the British claim to a sphere of influence over the Niger districts was accordingly recognized.

The British company, now given a charter and re-named the Royal Niger Company, proceeded to extend its influence into the interior by treaties with local rulers. There was friction with French interests but in 1898 the British and French Governments signed a convention regulating boundaries. In 1900 the administrative rights and powers of the Royal Niger Company were taken over by the Crown.

Until 1914 the country was administered in two parts—the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. The Colony comprised a small area around Lagos which had been annexed in 1862 as a base for operations against the slave trade. From 1900 to 1903 the authorities in Northern Nigeria were engaged in bringing under control the powerful emirates of the Hausa states and the Kanuri kingdom of Bornu which maintained large standing armies used for slave raiding.

In 1914 Northern and Southern Nigeria were amalgamated to form a Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. At the end of the 1914–18 war part of the adjacent territory of the German Cameroons (which had been occupied by Anglo-French forces) was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as part of Nigeria (following the formation of the United Nations the Cameroons became a Trusteeship Territory).

Under a constitution introduced in June 1951 there is a Central Council of Ministers presided over by the Governor and comprising six ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Lieutenant-Governors of the three Regions, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary) and 12 Ministers, four from each Region; and there is the House of Representatives comprising in addition to the President, 148 members—68 from the Northern Region, 34 each from the Western and Eastern Regions, six ex-officio members and six members appointed by the Governor to represent interests or communities not otherwise adequately represented. In the Regions, there are Regional Executive Councils presided over by the Lieutenant-Governor of each Region, and comprising 6–9 Regional Ministers (7–9 in the East, to include one from the Southern Cameroons), three ex-officio members and not more than two other official members. The Regional Legislatures consist of a House of Assembly in the East, and a House of Chiefs and a House of Assembly in the North and West. The Northern House of Chiefs comprises a President, three official members, all first-class chiefs, 37 other chiefs and the Adviser on Moslem Law (who has no vote). The Northern House of Assembly comprises a President, 90 elected members, four official members and ten special members. The Western House of Chiefs comprises a President, three official members, and not more than 50 chiefs. The Western House of Assembly comprises a President, 80 elected members, four official members and three special members. The Eastern House of Assembly comprises a President, 80 elected members, five official members and three special members.

Except in Lagos, where elections to the Western House of Assembly are direct, elections to the Regional Houses of Assembly are through electoral colleges. In the Eastern and Western Regions all adult taxpayers who are British subjects or British protected persons are qualified to vote. In the Northern Region, only males with these qualifications are entitled to vote. The Regional bodies select from their numbers those who are to sit in the House of Representatives.

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction
on alienation to non-natives. There is a small amount of Crown land acquired mainly for public purposes.

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and general tax. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for non-natives throughout Nigeria, and natives in the township of Lagos, to pay a graduated income tax ranging in 1950–51 from 4½d. in every £ of the first £200 to 15s. in the £ for every £ exceeding £10,000. There are special rates for incomes which do not exceed £150. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. In 1948 an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom Government for the avoidance of double taxation.

General tax is paid by natives outside the township of Lagos, assessed in a variety of ways from the individual assessment of wealthy traders in large towns to a flat rate in backward areas.

The other two main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duties.

The following is a table of public finance in the territory.

| Year    | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1937–38 | 7,342,450   | 7,375,570       |

* Approved Estimates.

In 1951–52 64% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 13% from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Social Services, Administration, Public Works and Development.

The Public Debt at the end of August 1952 amounted to £23,851,848 (approximately 18s. 4d. per head of population) comprising:

| Loan Type          | Amount (£) |
|--------------------|------------|
| 1923—4% Loan (1963)| 5,700,000  |
| 1935—3% Loan (1955)| 4,188,000  |
| 1946—3½% Loan (1956–61)| 300,000 |
| 1947—2½% Loan (1966–71)| 1,250,000 |
| 1949—3% Loan (1975–77)| 3,000,000 |
| 1951—3½% Loan (1964–66)| 6,800,000 |
| Loan from Cocoa Marketing Board | 2,613,848 |

£23,851,848

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d., ¼d. and tenth-penny. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par. In view of the need to conserve nickel supplies, new bronze pennies, half-pennies and tenths are also being introduced.

Nigeria received an allocation of £23,000,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. In 1951 the plan was revised and it is now proposed to spend about £34 million between 1951 and 1956. The money is to be found from the following sources:

| Source                  | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Colonial Development and Welfare Grant | 16,212,584 |
| Nigerian Revenue        | 8,020,557  |
| Loan funds              | 9,950,450  |

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- **Basic Services**: £15,537,931 (45.4%)
- **Social Services**: £10,338,082 (30.3%)
- **Productive Services**: £8,307,638 (24.3%)

**Basic Services**.—14.09% of the total will be spent on buildings and 9.29% on roads.

**Social Services**.—13.08% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 8.63% on general education.

**Productive Services**.—8.96% of the total will be spent on agriculture.

The Regional Production Development Boards are devoting large sums of money to the improvement of production methods for both food and export crops which is so essential to the well-being of the country. They include the operation of oil mills in the west and east, the distribution of artificial fertilizers, particularly in the north, a survey of cocoa soils, the establishment of a 20,000 acre cattle ranch in the east and a scheme for mechanizing rice cultivation in Sokoto. They are also spending large sums on roads. The Government has also set up a Development Board at Lagos to provide roads and services near Apapa Wharf to which the Colonial Development Corporation is lending £1½ million. The most important new industrial establishments were a new fruit-canning factory at Ibadan financed by the Western Regional Production Development Board and textile weaving mills at Lagos and Kano owned by Nigerian companies and being operated on their behalf by the Department of Commerce and Industries.

There is a University College at Ibadan with faculties of arts, science, medicine and agriculture. In the 1950–51 session there were 346 students. A Nigerian College of Technology opened at Ibadan in January 1952. Other branches will be opened at Zaria and Enugu. Other technical education is available at the Yaba Technical Institute which has 232 full-time students, and the Yaba, Kaduna, Enugu and Ombe River Trade Centres, which have between them 432 students. The Government awarded 113 scholarships for higher education in 1951, tenable at the University College or in the United Kingdom, United States or Canada. There were some 1,700 Nigerian students in the United Kingdom, of whom over 420 were women, and some 350 in North America. In 1951 there were 110 Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 24,425 students, 120 Teacher Training Colleges and Centres with an enrolment of 4,522 and 9,477 Primary Schools with an enrolment of 1,002,533. There were 77 adult literacy campaigns providing instruction for 108,453 pupils.

Expenditure on education services was some £4½ million in 1950–51 of which about £1½ million was contributed under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. In 1938 expenditure was £269,152.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1950–51 was £1,473,452 compared with £462,629 in 1938. In 1951 beds available in
hospitals (including maternity homes) totalled 9,229 (Government 5,002, Native Administration 1,655, Mission 1,488, private 1,084). In-patients at Government and Native Administration Hospitals totalled 131,850 and out-patients 1,270,788. There were 758 rural dispensaries at which 2,336,211 new cases were handled.

Kano, Lagos and Maiduguri are international airports and there are 15 other airfields used by the internal services of West African Airways Corporation. The Corporation also operates services connecting Lagos with the other British West African territories, Dakar and Khartoum. International services of B.O.A.C., K.L.M. and Air France connect Nigeria with London, Western Europe, the Union of South Africa and French West Equatorial Africa. A connexion to New York is available by the Pan American Service through Accra. The total number of aircraft movements in Nigeria for the year ending 31st March, 1951, was 20,292. Full meteorological forecasting offices are established at Kano and Lagos under the control of the British West African Meteorological Service with headquarters in Lagos.

The Nigerian Railway carried 5,585,043 passengers in 1950-51 and 1,225,209 tons of freight. Route mileage totals 1,904 and track mileage 2,218, plus 133 miles of narrow gauge.

There are 28,042 miles of road (1950); bituminous surface 1,024 miles, gravel or earth surface 27,018 miles.

The main ports are Lagos and Port Harcourt, and there are smaller ports at Calabar, Burutu, Sapele, Warri, Victoria and Tiko. Services for passengers and cargo from the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines Limited, which operates a regular fortnightly passenger service, and Palm Line Limited and John Holt Line Limited. Cargo and limited passenger services are also provided from the United States of America by the Barber West Africa Line, Farrell Lines and Delta Lines, from Holland and Germany by Holland West Africa Lijn, from Germany by Woermann Lines and from Mediterranean ports by various lines for which French West Africa Lines Limited act as agents. Cargo services are also operated from Scandinavian ports by Hoegh Line and Scandinavian West Africa Line.

The river Niger and its chief tributary, the river Benue, are the principal inland water highways. The Niger is navigable for a distance of 537 miles upstream to Jebba and the Benue for 547 miles from Lokoja to Garua in the French Cameroons. Although the Benue and the upper reaches of the Niger are only navigable during a limited season at high water, both rivers provide an important alternative to the Nigerian Railway for the evacuation of produce. In all there are approximately 4,000 miles of navigable inland waterways in Nigeria.

The Government runs broadcasting stations at Lagos, Kaduna and Enugu. It is intended to train Nigerians to do as much of this work as possible. There were 2,743 licence holders in 1951 with an estimated four listeners per receiver. A Government wired broadcast service operates in the Northern and Eastern Regions.

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture, and retail trade. Substantial numbers are engaged in Government and local government service, transport, mining, civil and constructional engineering, and in building.

The main crops are yams, cassava, guinea corn and millet, cocoyams, groundnuts, oil palms, maize, cocoa, rice and cotton.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: goats 10,738,000, cattle 5,860,000, sheep 5,622,000, horses 212,000, swine 221,000, asses 941,000.

Timber exports in 1951 totalled over 18,000,000 cubic feet.

Despite extensive fishing in inland and coastal waters, the supply of fish does not meet the demand. At sea, improved methods of fishing by canoe and motor boat are being developed. The Colonial Development Corporation are operating two large trawlers. Inland reservoirs are being stocked and village fishing ponds started. One fish farm of 500 acres is being constructed in the north.

The chief minerals are tin, all of which is exported, and coal which is used almost entirely by the railway. Small quantities of columbite, lead, zinc and gold are also produced. Tin production runs at about 12,000 tons a year and coal at about 550,000 tons.

Apart from hand methods of expressing groundnut and palm oil, there are 57 palm oil mills operated mainly by Regional Production Development Boards; five groundnut oil mills, three of which are privately owned; three soap factories at Apapa, Aba and Kano; a cigarette factory at Ibadan; a brewery at Lagos; several small plants producing fruit juices, minerals and soda water; a cannery; an up-to-date plywood and veneer factory at Sapele, several small sawmills elsewhere; two 50-loom weaving mills, one near Lagos, the other at Kano; some light engineering works; tyre re-treading plants; a ceramic factory; and several rice mills, some being Government-operated.

(Including bullion and specie)

The distribution of trade is as follows:

| Year | United Kingdom | Other British Countries | Foreign Countries |
|------|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
|      | Per cent.      | Per cent.              | Per cent.        |
| 1938 | 55             | 9                      | 36               |

The chief imports are cotton piece goods, rayon piece goods, bags and sacks, salt, beer, tobacco, corrugated iron sheets, machinery, bicycles, motor vehicles, petrol and cement.

Four independent Marketing Boards handle the five main export crops—cocoa, palm kernels and palm oil, groundnuts and cotton. They ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, spend money on research and finance schemes for the economic benefit of the people in the producing areas. The Government and the Marketing Boards have a common policy of developing co-operative organizations. Its success is indicated by the fact that the tonnage of cocoa marketed by the Association of Nigerian Co-operative Exports was valued last season at nearly £2,000,000 which represents a very large proportion of all cocoa sold to the Board by Nigerian licensed buying agents. The Government also finances the Department of Co-operative Societies whose activities and scope have expanded steadily. On the 30th June, 1952, there were 1,183 co-operative societies with a total membership exceeding 63,000. Their assets aggregated more than £650,000.
