BARBADOS.

Situation and Area.

Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, a little larger than Rutland.

History.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who finding it uninhabited and rude in appearance, named the isle Los Barbudos, from the number of bearded fig-trees which they found. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship "Olive" in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1625 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed on the leeward side of the island formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I of all the Caribbean Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300l. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Woolerstone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The leeward and windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1682, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

General Description.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, in latitude 13° 5' 42" North, and longitude 59° 38' 29" West. This town contains, according to the census of 1891, 21,000 inhabitants. Speightstown, the only other town, has about 1,500 inhabitants.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or careenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. It is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1898, 47 vessels, of a total net tonnage of 7,372 tons.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as off the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation.

A geological map, with explanatory memoir of the island, was published in 1891 by Messrs. J. B. Harrison and A. J. Jukes Brown, which shows that that area of the island called the Scotland district, which is the part enclosed by a semicircular sweep of the ridge in the north-east, is composed of sandstones, clays, and insular earths, the products of which may be in future a valuable source of revenue to the island; already excellent fire-bricks are made near the end of the railway.

In Schomburgk's history of Barbados there is a short reference to the deposit of asphaltum found in the island, and Messrs. A. J. Jukes Browne and J. B. Harrison casually mention it as occurring occasionally in small quantities, which planters have attempted to burn under their sugar boilers, but not with sufficient success to lead to its general use. In 1893 an American named Julius Pinney suggested to Mr. Walter Merivale, M.I.C.E., late managing director of the Barbados Railway, the possibility of mining it for commercial purposes. A mine was opened by Mr. Merivale on the College Estate in January, 1896, from which about 500 tons of the purest asphaltum were extracted during the year 1898. Other mines have since been opened, and in 1898 the total amount of manjak exported from the island amounted to 1,160 tons. The market is gradually opening to this new product, and prices are obtained varying from 2l. to 7l. a ton. There appears to be a demand for it in the following trades: varnish making, gas making, electric cable insulating, asphalt paving, &c. It seems probable that the deposits extend under the coral in all parts of the island.

Much of the geological information concerning the coral area was obtained from borings, &c., made by the Barbados Water Supply Company, whose operations were undertaken with a view to supply the rural population of the different parishes with
water up to a height of 750 feet above sea-level. The town of Bridgetown was supplied for many years with an adequate supply of good water by the Bridgetown Water Works Company.

Both companies have been bought up by the Government, and the works are being extended to all the parishes of the Island.

Industry.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes; besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. In 1898 there were 441 sugar-works in operation. The produce of 1871 amounted to 53,800 hogsheads of sugar and 33,500 puncheons of molasses; in 1881, 52,236 hogsheads of sugar, and 33,521 puncheons of molasses. In 1891 the produce amounted to 50,547 hogsheads of sugar and 32,318 puncheons of molasses, as compared with 85,261 hogsheads of sugar, and 51,904 puncheons of molasses in 1890. In 1892, 56,619 hogsheads of sugar, and 43,356 puncheons of molasses. In 1893, 67,157 hogsheads of sugar and 43,374 puncheons of molasses were exported. The exports of produce for the year 1898 amounted to 53,575 hogsheads of sugar, and 34,125 puncheons of molasses. The area under sugar cultivation is estimated at 100,000 acres. In September, 1898, the island, in common with St. Lucia and St. Vincent, suffered severely from the effects of a disastrous hurricane.

Population.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939; and although it is estimated that some 20,000 were carried off by cholera in 1854, the census of 1861 showed a total of 152,727 inhabitants. By the census of 1871 there were 162,042 inhabitants, of whom 16,560 were white, and the remainder coloured and black; the natural increase having been checked by the migration to other West Indian Islands of large numbers of the labouring population. In 1881 the total was 171,452; by the census of 1891 the population is returned at 182,306, and is now estimated at 190,000. English is universally spoken. Labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in sterling, and British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, and there is but little gold in circulation. The only bank doing business in Barbados is the Colonial Bank, capital paid up 600,000l. sterling. Total number of branches throughout West Indies 13, with deposits of about 1,500,000l., and a note circulation (five dollar notes) of 350,000l. In Barbados the estimated circulation is 30,000l. There is a Government savings bank which had on 30th September, 1897, 12,716 depositors, and deposits amounting to 218,575l.

Internal Communication.

A railway from Bridgetown to the parish of Saint Andrew (24 miles as surveyed) was commenced in 1889, and completed on 10th September, 1882. The total cost of construction was 195,284l.; the receipts for the year 1897 were 5,503l., exclusive of Government subsidy of 6,000l., and the expenses 5,952l. Of the subsidy of 6,000l. per annum granted by the Legislature, only a sum of 82l. 17s. 6d. was paid in 1897, in consequence of the failure of the Company to comply with the provisions of Act 51 of 1896. It belonged to the Barbados Railway Company, Limited, but was on the 15th July, 1898, purchased by the Foreign American and General Trust Co., Ltd., for the sum of 50,000l. No subsidy was paid during the year 1898. The whole line is under reconstruction.

There is telephonic communication between the police stations by 35 miles of line, which cost 1,465l., and is open to public use. The Barbados Telephone Co. (Limited), a private company contains a total of 470 services, with a total length of line in use of about 600 miles.

Mail Service, Postage, &c.

The Royal Mail steamers arrive in and leave Barbados every alternate week from and to England. There is also fortnightly communication with all the West Indies by these steamers. The usual length of the voyage from England to Barbados is 11 days.

Besides the Royal Mail, a steamer of the West Indian and Pacific, or the Harrison Line, arrives every week from Liverpool.

The direct Scrutton line from London arrives monthly.

The Quebec line of steamers arrive fortnightly from the United States there are also other lines of steamers, viz., the Red Cross Line and Booth Line, which call at Barbados on their voyage from New York to the Brazils and vice versa, at intervals of about 20 days.

The Canadian line of steamers from Halifax arrive monthly. There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados, and direct cable communication with St. Vincent, and thence to the other West Indies, America, and Europe.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act No. 41 of the 9th December, 1899.

* See list at end of Introduction. A new rate of parcel postage with the U.K. came into force on 1st Jan. 1899.
bor, 1878, which authorised an expenditure not exceeding £15,000 annually. This section of the Act of 1878 has been repealed, and Section 9 (d) of the Education Act Amendment Act, 1897, authorises an annual expenditure of a sum not exceeding £11,000 on elementary education. Grants to higher education made the sum total of expenditure in 1898 £16,360.

The central administration is vested in a Board appointed by the Governor, and the local control conducted by the clergyman of the district assisted by the School Committee. There are 175 schools, with 14,734 scholars (average attendance), and 27,776 on the rolls.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of £30 per annum from the College funds—though hardly any of these scholarships are at present available owing to lack of funds—and four Island Scholarships at £40 per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or sons of natives, or of persons domiciled in the island who have resided therein for at least ten years. There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation, which has been liberally supported by the Legislature. It has a staff of 7 university men as Masters, a Professor of Chemistry and Agricultural Science, and a Professor of German. The average number of pupils during 1898 was 153. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish, to the N.E. of the island, was re-opened in 1882, after having been closed for several years. The number of pupils at the close of 1898 was 41. There are four Barbados Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, each of the annual value of £175, tenable at Oxford or Cambridge for four years.

A first grade school for girls was opened in 1888, called the Queen's College. It has a staff of seven mistresses and a music master. The number of pupils was 101 at the close of 1898.

There are four second grade schools for boys, and two for girls. These schools cost the Government, including grants for scholarships, £1,075 annually.

Defence.

Barbados is the headquarters of the military force in the West Indies, having an imperial garrison of 31 officers and 822 non-commissioned officers and men. Charles Fort, on the south west of the island, is a fortified position carrying heavy guns. The Imperial garrison is, however, now in process of transference to St. Lucia. Proposals for the establishment of a volunteer force for local defence are under consideration.

Police, &c.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1835 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1867) were combined with the Land Police. A Juvenile Reformatory was opened in April, 1883.

A lunatic asylum, the construction of which was begun in 1891, supplies a want which had long been felt. A lazaretto is also kept up at the public expense; and there is a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the support of which the colony contributes £6,630 per annum.

Constitution.

The colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the appointment and control of public officers. The Government consists of a Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of nine members appointed by the Queen, and a House of Assembly, having twenty-four members elected annually on the basis of a moderate franchise. The qualification of members and electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, which became law in April, 1884, and which repeals all previous legislation on the subject. By this Act a liberal extension of the franchise was granted, and about 2,208 electors are registered under its provisions, the number previous to its enactment being only 1,641. This and other Acts relating to the franchise was consolidated by the Representation of the People Act, 1891, which became law on 1st January, 1892, and its amending Act of the 14th July, 1898. The only change made was the extension of the franchise to persons enjoying a pension of £50 a year or more. The number of registered electors for the year 1898 was 1,922. The executive part of the Government consists of the Governor, the Officer commanding the troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General or officio, and such other persons as may be nominated by the Queen, one member of the Legislative Council, and four members of the House of Assembly nominated by the Governor. This body is called the Executive Committee, and introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates and initiates all Government measures. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Tobago, but in 1885, by Royal Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands, and made a distinct Government.
