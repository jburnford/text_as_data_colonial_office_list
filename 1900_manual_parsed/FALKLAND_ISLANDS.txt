FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Monte Video. They consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54° S. and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Roque in 1765, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited, and almost perpetually icebound. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles (equal to Wales).

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1763 they were taken possession of by France, and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1764. In the following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison, which was drawn out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774, and no further formal occupation made till 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or Anna Maria) until 1844, when it was moved to William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 800. The houses are mostly of wood and iron, built as they are required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house, but there are several small hotels affording comfortable accommodation. The general aspect of the town is scarcely in keeping with the substantial prosperity of its inhabitants. It has a post office, a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1884, five vessels of a total tonnage of 236 tons. It has a fine inner and outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going round Cape Horn. There are two Government schools with 120 pupils, a Roman Catholic school with 53, and a Baptist school with 40. The attendance averages two-thirds of the number on the rolls. At Darwin, on the East Falkland, there is a small hamlet where the Falkland Islands Company have a school with about a score of pupils, as well as a travelling schoolmaster with some 20 scholars. From Bay, on the West Falkland, is the residence of the Stipendiary Magistrate, and two Government travelling schoolmasters are engaged in instructing the young in the most remote shepherd's houses in that Island.

The climate is severe but healthy, except for those predisposed to pulmonary affections. It is uniformly cold, the mean temperature being 42°. The thermometer ranges between 30° and 50° in winter, and between 40° and 65° in summer. The cold is intensified by constant high winds which
prevail, especially in the summer, rising about 10 a.m., and falling away between 4 and 5 p.m. There is an abundance of mist and rain, the annual rainfall being 28.80 inches; in the summer however, the atmosphere is remarkably dry, and evaporation is rapid.

The entire country is wild moorland, interspersed with rocks and stone runs. Stone of two or three kinds, suitable for building, is found in different parts of the island. The soil is chiefly soft peat, and travelling is difficult. There are no roads except within the limits of Stanley, and communication is by sea or on horseback. The islands are so well adapted for sheep-farming, that the entire acreage has been devoted to that industry. The tussock, which grows to the height of seven feet, and affords fattening food for cattle, has now disappeared from the East and West Falklands, but it still abounds on the smaller islands. Celery, scurvy grass and sorrel are very plentiful, besides a small plant called the tea plant, much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos. In November and December the ground is covered with a profuse variety of sweet-scented flowers. The cultivation of fruit and vegetables is made difficult by the damp, cold nature of the soil and the prevalence of high winds. Trees are completely absent.

Mutton is bought for 2d., beef for 5d. per lb., fowls 3s. each, eggs, when procurable, for 2½d. Fresh milk is bought for between 4d. and 6d. a pint in summer, but cannot be obtained in winter. Apples and oranges of an inferior sort imported from Chili and Uruguay fetch 2d. each.

The sole industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Patagonia. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were, in 1897—2,758 horses, 7,343 cattle, 732,010 sheep.

The chief export is wool. The other exports consist of frozen mutton, sheep skins, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general supplies, and ship's stores.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and local 5l. and 1l. notes. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government savings' bank of the usual type was established, in which, on 30th September, 1899, the deposits were 44,000l., belonging to 360 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Latonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 97,128 acres purchased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a very flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of over 20 per cent. Its capital is 110,000l., all paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by Mr. W. A. Harding, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin, and contributes to the provision of a salary for a clergyman of the Church of England.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England every 21 days. The German "Kosmos" Steamship Company Steamer calls at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao and on the return voyage, once every three weeks. The voyage between Stanley and London occupies four weeks. Mails for the Falkland Islands are also carried by the Pacific Company's Steamer, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos Steamer to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to the United Kingdom, India, and certain Colonies,* 1d. per ½ oz.; to elsewhere, 2½d. per ½ oz.; there is an internal post 1d. the oz. Parcel post to England, 1s. for 3 lbs., 2s. for 7 lbs., 3s. for 11 lbs.; internal parcel post, 4½d. for 3 lbs., 8½d. for 7 lbs., and 1s. for 11 lbs. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Monte Video. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of from 500l. to 600l.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Chief Justice, the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet for five years.
