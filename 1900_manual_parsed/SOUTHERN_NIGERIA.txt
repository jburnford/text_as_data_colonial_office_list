SOUTHERN NIGERIA.

The British Protectorate of the Niger Districts was announced in the London Gazette of June 5, 1885. It extended along the coast of Africa from a point about 10 miles N.W. from the Benin River (where it joins the boundary of Lagos) to the mouth of the Rio del Rey at 9° east longitude. The part between the Forcados River and the Nun mouth of the Niger was included in the territories administered by the Royal Niger Company under their charter of July 10, 1886; the remainder formed the "Niger Coast Protectorate." The Niger itself was worked exclusively by the river steamers of the Niger Company. The numerous rivers, creeks, and estuaries in this part of the West African coast have received the name of the "Oil Rivers," from the fact of their producing the bulk of the palm oil which constitutes the chief export of West Africa. They are alleged to be branches of the Niger, and form the delta of that river, but most of them have independent sources. The estuaries of these rivers are connected by a network of more or less navigable creeks, so that with a small expenditure of labour inland navigation might be made practicable from Dahomey to the Cameroons.

Some of the principal of these rivers are: the Benin, an independent river rising in the low range of hills flowing in a deep but tortuous channel through a country of dense forest, but with a shallow and dangerous bar; the Forcados River, the main outlet of the Wari; the Brass River, connected by creeks with the Niger. From the Oguta Lake, which lies a short distance east of the Niger, to the north of Abe, where the delta begins in the rainy season, flow the Opobo River on the east, and the New Calabar River on the west, which enter the sea by the broad estuaries known as the Sombrero, the New Calabar, the Bonny, the Andoni, and the Opobo Rivers, and drain a fertile undulating country, watered by numerous little brooks, and with a rich soil free from marsh, and where cattle appear to thrive.

Further east is the Old Calabar Estuary, mainly formed by the great Cross River, some 400 or 500 miles in length, which drains with its affluents the Old Calabar, Aqua, Akpayafe, and the Ndiana Rivers; the high mountain ranges running northwest from the Cameroon Mountains to the hills round the confluence of the Niger and the Benin.

On the 1st January, 1900, the Crown took over the administration of the territories of the Royal Niger Company, and under an Order in Council dated December 27, 1899, those territories, from the coast to Iddo, were incorporated in the Niger Coast Protectorate, and the province thus formed was given the name of "Southern Nigeria," and the administrator became the High Commissioner.

This incorporation added about 106 miles of coastline (from the Forcados to the Brass River) to the coast under the administration of the Niger Coast Protectorate.

Communications.

Communication with Europe is maintained by the African and the British and African Steamship Companies, running regularly between Liverpool, Hamburg, Havre, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Sierra Leone, and all the ports in West Africa from Goree to Loanda. They have also a direct line from Liverpool to Old Calabar, calling at Grand Canary, Sierra Leone, Accra, Lagos, and Bonny. The German Woerman line call occasionally on their way to and from the Cameroons, and the steamers of the Compagnie "Chargeurs Reunis" call occasionally at Bonny and Old Calabar. On the Bonny, Brass, Opobo, and Old Calabar Rivers, some of the merchants possess small steamers and launches, which navigate these rivers to some distance inland. The Manchester Steam Navigation Company's boats also call at some of the ports. Akassa is served from Brass, being only 11 miles through the Creeks.

The African Direct Cable Company has stations at Brass and Bonny.

Chief Towns.

Duke Town, or Old Calabar, on the river of the same name, is about 5 miles above its junction with the Cross River, and is the headquarters of the administration with a population of about 15,000. A Presbyterian mission is established there. Creek Town, 4 miles beyond, is also an important place, population about 5,000.

Near the mouth of the Opobo River is the town of the same name built by Ja Ja, and about 40 or 50 miles inland near the same river is Bende, a great Ju Ju centre. Bonny Town, 8 miles from the sea, on the left bank of the Bonny, is a station of the Church Missionary Society, and contains several European establishments. There is also a European settlement at the mouth of the Brass, possessing a very fine church presented by one of the native chiefs.

Benin City, some 60 miles up the river of the same name, is a large town of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants. It was formerly the seat of a powerful theocracy of fetish priests, and famous for its human sacrifices. It was taken in 1897, in the circumstances stated below, and is now a thriving trading centre, with a British Resident and administrative staff; it is also a military post. The trading station and Consular establishment in Benin River is situated about 8 miles from the bar, lying open to the sea breeze, though sand-flies and mosquitos abound.

In Jan., 1897, a peaceful mission on its way to the King of Benin was massacred in the bush, and a force of native troops and Blue Jackets had to be sent to punish the Benis. The expedition was completely successful, the king's forces being defeated, and the king himself driven to take refuge in the bush. The king was afterwards captured, and is now in exile at Old Calabar.

Climate.

This resembles that of other parts of West Africa, in being most unhealthy for Europeans. The temperature ranges between 65° and 95°, there being on the coast no very marked distinction in temperature between the dry and rainy seasons. Tornadoes and violent thunderstorms prevail in the spring and late autumn.
Products.

Besides the oil palm (Elaeis Guineensis), cotton grows above the delta, and the silk cotton tree is found all over the delta, as well as the tree producing the kola nut. The ground nut is widely cultivated in the interior, but not on the coast. Copal gum and other gums are largely produced, and "shea butter," an almost solid vegetable fat produced from the kernels of the seeds of the Butyrospermum Parkii. The castor oil plant is found all over the delta, and the cocoon palm and coffee have been successfully introduced there. Rubber trees abound everywhere, and ebony very largely in the Cross River districts. Elephants abound in numbers in the Akpayafe and Nokana Rivers, and hippopotami in the Cross River. Considerable coffee plantations have been established.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants are typical negroes, and though now divided into several distinct tribes, appear to have had a common origin. Among the most prominent tribes are the Jakri, occupying the lower part of the Benin, and closely allied to the Yorubas; the Idzos, occupying the part of the delta east of the Middleton, and south of the Wari and of the Ibo country; the Ibos, occupying the lower Niger just above the delta, and extending to the Cross River, joining the Akuna-Kunas, are an industrious agricultural people, with fine herds of cattle, who create most of the trade of the delta; and the Efiks and "Quas" in the Old Calabar region. The tribes are all more or less cannibalistic, cannibalism being done in association with the ceremonial of the old fetish rites, as the "ju-ju-Men," or fetish priests, are bound at certain times and under certain conditions to eat human flesh. The missionaries have laboured with considerable success to suppress the practice in the towns where they are stationed. Mission stations are situated at Duke Town, Creek Town, Okoyun, on the Old Calabar River, at Ikonota Creek, Ikorofofon, Ikotana, and Unwana, on the Cross River, and also at Ibeno, in the Qua Ibo River.

Trade.

Trade is generally conducted by barter, the native traders purchasing the oil or other produce for European goods, and disposing of it in large quantities to the white trader. The total volume of trade is shown below, the greater part of which is with Great Britain, the remainder with Havre and Hamburg, but carried principally in British ships. Brass rods only in Old Calabar, and Manillas only in Bonny and Opobo, form in some districts the coinage, the price of cloth being the general standard. Cash is being gradually introduced.

Administration.

The native inhabitants are dealt with principally under their own chiefs, there being native councils, presided over by them, subject to appeal to the British courts. Europeans are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts under Order in Council.
