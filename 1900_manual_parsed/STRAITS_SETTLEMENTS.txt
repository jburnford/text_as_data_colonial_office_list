**STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.**

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament 29 & 30 Vict., c. 115.

**Situation and Area.**

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 204 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 0' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the main land from which the island is separated lies a strip from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 288 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 265 square miles, two-thirds forest, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly. The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1857, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1865, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ½ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 165° 40' E., annexed in July, 1888, was placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. It is nine miles long and nine miles wide; wooded, and has only a few inhabitants. It lies 200 miles S.W. of Java.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is 1,542 square miles (nearly equal to that of Kent).

**History.**

Malacca, known as an important independent state from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795 when it was taken possession of by the English and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally passed into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland of the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should leave the Malay Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, where the commerce of a new year trade almost died, and it became what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch restrictions; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening up of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon (Puket or Tongkah), and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island as it is officially called, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1785, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1798, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Raja, now called Province Wellesley. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 288 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and cocoanuts. In 1805 Penang was made a separate...
Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Native Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British, and the whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

There is some evidence of Singapore having been an important trading centre in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the tradition is that the place was attacked and devastated in 1253 by the Javanese. Thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johor princes. It was at first subordinate to Bencoolen (Port Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated, in 1826, with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 9 official members and 7 unofficial members, of whom two are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts.

There is a Supreme Court which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

Defence.

The new harbour of Singapore, comprising the coal stores, wharves, and docks, is defended by several forts armed with armour piercing and medium guns, and by a system of submarine mines. The initial cost of the forts amounted to nearly 100,000£, and was defrayed out of the revenue of the Colony; the Imperial Government supplying the guns and ammunition only.

The garrison comprises one battalion of infantry at war strength, one company of garrison artillery on the higher establishment, and district establishment royal artillery, one company of Asiatic artillery, half a company of fortress engineers, and a company of Malay submarine miners.

The Colony also maintains an armed police force, consisting of 32 officers and over 1,900 men, and a battery of volunteer artillery, consisting of 105 officers and men. The latter during times of war would be placed under the orders of the officer commanding the troops, and act as auxiliaries to the European artillery.

Climate.

The climate varies but little in temperature during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1898 was 79°-7°F.; in Penang, 78°-3°F.; in Province Wellesley, 81°-2°F.; and in Malacca, 79°-4°F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 91°-2° and 70°-6°F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations from 1869 to 1890 it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 167 wet days; the average rainfall for the same period being 91°-79 inches. In 1898 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 106°-19 inches, in Penang 124°-51 inches, in Province Wellesley 90°-33 inches, in Malacca, 78°-83 inches, and in the Dindings 90°-21 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have south-east, south or south-west winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.

Population.

At the census taken in April, 1881 and 1891, the population of the settlements was ascertained to be as follows:

|                | 1881   | 1891   |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Singapore      | 139,208| 184,554|
| Penang, Province Wellesley, and Dindings | 190,597| 235,618|
| Malacca        | 93,579 | 92,170 |
| Total          | 423,364| 512,342|

The total at the census of 1866 was 273,000.

Trade.

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of 1 anna per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmegs, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, &c. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are gambier and pepper (in Singapore); tapioca and rice (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley).

The quantities of some of the exports in 1898 were: Coffee, 43,618 pikuls; gambier, 891,935 pikuls; principal gums, 269,978 pikuls; principal spices, 753,313 pikuls; tapioca, 802,000 pikuls; and tin, 766,216 pikuls. The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The quantities imported in 1898 were: Cotton piece goods, 5,719,552 pieces; coal, 508,000 tons; rice, 7,301,466 pikuls; opium, 14,444 chests; and silk piece goods, 317,036 pieces. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and the Native States. Singapore and Georgetown (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had, on the 31st Dec., 1898, 710 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 63,377 tons.
Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe, via Ceylon, and with China and Japan weekly by the P. and O., Messageries Maritimes, and Ocean Company (Holt's) steamers, and at longer intervals by those of the Norddeutscher Lloyd, Hamburg-America, East Asiatic, Austro-Hungary Lloyd's, British India, Glen, Japanese, and other lines; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla, via Saigon, by Messageries Maritimes and Spanish packets; with Bangkok weekly by Holt's and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Messageries Maritimes and Netherland India Company's steamers; Australian ports weekly, and otherwise by P. and O. and Messageries Maritimes via Canton, British India, China Navigation Company, and other lines; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, fortnightly by the Negapatam steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, British India, Apar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and other ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, &c., by local lines. Most of the larger steamers call at Penang. Letters from England reach Singapore in from 21 to 25 days.

The number of letters, books, &c., received in 1898 was 3,238,110, and 3,422,858 were dispatched.

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1898 to £1,141,606, the principal business done being with the United Kingdom, India, and the Native States.

There is telegraphic communication by submarine cables (3) from Penang to Madras, Malacca, and Singapore; and from Singapore (2) to Saigon and Hué, and thence to Hong Kong, Japan, and Russia.

There is also a Government telegraph line from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Sungai Ujong, and Malacca. The cable from Singapore to Malacca is subsidized by the Government. There are 20 miles of telegraph line in connection with the cables, and there are 717 miles of telephone line. There are no railways within the Colony itself. In Penang there are 4 miles of tramway open, constructed and worked by a private firm; the motive power is steam. A railway is under construction to connect Penang with Taiping, the capital of the State of Perak.

Education.

There is no law affecting education. The expenditure on education is voted each year by the Legislative Council of the Colony. The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Inspector of Schools.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unsectarian, and there is no compulsory education.

The number of schools and scholars is as follows:

| No. of Schools | Attendance |
|----------------|------------|
| Grant-in-aid boys' schools | 27 | 4,971 |
| Grant-in-aid girls' schools | 9 | 1,233 |
| Government English schools | 6 | 851 |
| Government vernacular boys' schools | 134 | 6,291 |
| Government vernacular girls' schools | 31 | 903 |

Total: 207 | 14,249

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the colony, by an order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, is the silver Mexican dollar, but the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar are also legal tender.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively.

The amount of coin in circulation is estimated at twelve million dollars.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Mercantile Bank of India Limited, and the Netherlands Trading Society.

The average note issue during 1898 amounted to $7,737,057.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1898, the deposits amounted to $410,917.

The Native Weights are:

1 kati = 16 tahil = 1 ¼ lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 5333½ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipal Boards at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, the members of which are partly elected by the ratepayers and partly nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1898 was $1,337,500; and the expenditure $1,339,602.

The Federated States of the Malay Peninsula.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Pétrak in 1818.

For some years prior to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Pétrak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British trade.

In the beginning of 1874 similar matters were brought to a crisis in Pétrak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874).

Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Pétrak, Selangor, and Sungai Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Remban; a federation was formed in 1889, by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungai Ujong, who since 1883 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland state of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present federal state (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, under which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to aid the native rulers by advice, and generally to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to Government. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State, and are subordinate to the High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In addition to the above States, the State and Territory of Johor, with which a treaty had been made as early as the year 1855, and other treaties subsequently, entered into closer relations with the Colony in 1887, when the Sultan placed his foreign relations in the hands of the British Government, and agreed to receive a British Agent, who, however, has not yet been appointed.

In 1885 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States other than Johor, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements stand, the States agree to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States, to control the Residents appointed to each State and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the necessary powers conferred by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertake to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, all moneys so advanced being considered as loans, and also undertake to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for the service throughout the States; and should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power, they engage to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States named meet periodically in one of the states, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of a mutual nature. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Pétrak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four states, with their most important chiefs, the Resident General and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various states.

Statistics.

The following figures will give an idea of the relative importance of the four Federated States:

| State       | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pétrak      | $3,542,115| $3,587,224   |
| Selangor    | $3,334,468| $2,817,292   |
| S. Ujong and | $397,130  | $64,082     |
| Negri Sembilan | $137,876 | $144,679    |
| Pahang      | $100,220  | $212,975    |
The debt of Pétrak, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang on the same date, including intestate loans, was as follows:

- Pétrak to Selangor: $500,000
- Negri Sembilan to S.S. Settlements: $255,000
- Negri Sembilan to Pétrak: $210,000
- Negri Sembilan to Pétrak Savings Bank: $30,000

Total Negri Sembilan: $495,000
Pahang to the S.Settlements: $854,880
Selangor: $1,093,911

An English loan of 500,000l. for expenses of railway extension in the Federated Malay States has been arranged for.

Railways.

Railway construction has made, and is making, rapid progress.

The following lines are open for traffic: in Pétrak, from Port Weld, via Taiping, the capital, to Ulu Sa'petang, 17 miles, and from Teluk Anson to Enggor, 50 miles; an extension to Taiping and Prat, and from Tapah to Tanjung Malim are under consideration. In Selangor, from Kuala Klang, the chief port, to Kwala Lumpur, the capital, 27 miles; and from thence to Kwala Kubu, 38½ miles, with a small branch line from Kuala Lumpur to Kajang, 9 miles. In Sungai Ujong, from Port Dickson to Seremban, the capital, 21 miles.

The following lines are under construction by Selangor: from Kuala Kubu to Tanjung Malim, 15 miles; and from Kajang to Seremban.

An important line has been surveyed to connect the east and west States of the Peninsula. If constructed, it will probably run from Kuala Kubu, via Raub to Kuala Lipis, in Pahang, a distance of 80 miles. There is, however, no prospect of this work being undertaken in the immediate future. It is estimated that the railway extensions now projected will cost about £1,000,000, which will connect Port Dickson, in Negri Sembilan, with Kuala Prai, in the mainland opposite Penang, will be completed by the year 1912. A short section from Babit Martajani to Penang is already opened for traffic, and connected with Penang by steam ferry.

Pétrak.

Pétrak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable prosperity, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1876, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment to the Seychelles of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State is well watered, the Pétrak, with its tributaries the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor, and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau, and the Bernam, with its tributary, the Slim. The mountains on the east boundary, being part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of 8,000 feet.
The chief export is tin. Sugar and rice are extensively grown, and tea and coffee plantations have been opened with success. The cultivation of rubber and other products, including ramie, are now attracting attention. In the Krian district the Government has in hand an extensive scheme for irrigation of some 63,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Taiping and Kinta are the chief mining districts, the tin from the former being shipped at Port Weld, the port of Taiping, which is the headquarters of Government, and from the latter at Teluk Anson, a port near the mouth of the Perak River. The district between the Kinta valley and the Selangor boundary contains deposits of tin and gold, and a road and railway are in course of construction through this part of the State.

The total length of completed roads in Perak is approximately 600 miles of cart roads, and 550 miles of bridle paths.

Selangor.

Selangor adjoins Perak along its southern frontier. Its inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Perak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines. The State is drained by four rivers: the Bernam, Selangor, Klang, and Langat.

When the State touches the central range of the Peninsula, there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet, and one of 6,200 feet.

The chief town is Kwala Lumpur, which is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula. The chief industry of the State is tin mining. Coffee planting, under European supervision, has made good progress of late years, although it has received a temporary check owing to the recent fall in the price of Liberian coffee; and rice, pepper, and other products have been grown with success. The total mileage in Selangor is 426 miles of cart roads and 129 miles of bridle paths.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

The federal State of the Negri Sembilan, as at present constituted, dates from 1895; but a federation under that title already existed in the last century. The present federation consists of the following States, viz., Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and of the six smaller states of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terach, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh. The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban, and there are district officers at Port Dickson, on the coast, Kwala Klang, in Jelebu, Kwala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and Tapah. A railway line from Seremban with Port Dickson; and Seremban and Kuala Lipis in Selangor, are about to be connected by rail. 223 miles of cart roads and 174 miles of bridle paths are in existence in Negri Sembilan.

The revenue is derived mainly from tin and agriculture. The miners are Chinese, the Malay population being almost entirely agricultural. Oil palm is grown in Gemencheh and on the Muar River. Coffee has been successfully cultivated, and there are many large tapioca and gambier estates. There is also a considerable production of rice. A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Melacca.

Pahang.

Pahang, the largest of the Protected Native States, is on the east coast of the Peninsula. Its native rulers have for many years looked southward, formerly towards Daik and later to the Colony, for protection against their northern neighbours.

Gunong Teletu, which is said to be about 10,000 feet high, and the next highest summit in the Peninsula, has not yet been ascended.

Besides containing the highest summit in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jehai, Tembeling, Samantan, Triang, Bara Lui, and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endan also debouch into the China Sea, the last-named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johor.

These rivers are unfortunately so shallow as to be navigable for only steam launches and other small craft, except in the rainy season; and during the north-east monsoon their mouths are difficult of access.

The country is rich in gold, tin, and galena, and several companies under European or Australian direction are at work. The capital has hitherto been Pekan, near the mouth of the Pahang River, where the Sultan still resides, but the seat of government has been removed 200 miles up stream to Kuila Lipis. A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Lipis in this State, and a cart road of 80 miles' length has been constructed from Kuila Kubu, the terminus of the Selangor State Railway, to Kuila Lipis. A branch road has also been made with Government assistance from Pras to Benting, a distance of some 20 miles, for the purpose of opening up the mines in that district.

Tasmania.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide; the important colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 40' and 43° 38' S. lat., and 144° 39' and 148° 23' E. long.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Diemen's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1833. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797, but was formally taken possession of by England in 1803 as a penal auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian colonies.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1898 the highest shade temperature recorded was 102° on the 24th Feb., and the lowest 34° on the 21st June. The mean range for the year was 15.5. Rain fell on 164 days in the year, and the rainfall was a little more than 20 inches.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 1,227 miles of telegraph (with 3,078 miles of wire) open in the colony. This excludes 428 miles of cable belonging to the Tasmanian Cable Company. The total cost of telegraph construction up to 31st Dec., 1898, was £233,730, the receipts in 1898 being £30,262. There are also 705 miles of telephone, which yield an annual rental of £3,888.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The number of messages sent was 372,575 of which 128,326 were cable.

Steamers run between Hobart and Melbourne twice and sometimes three times a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney every week. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and Melbourne, and Hobart and New Zealand twice a month. There are also steamers trading be-
