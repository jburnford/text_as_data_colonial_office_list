TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.
The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is 169 square miles, about the size of Rutland. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 6½ miles long and 2 miles broad. It contains 1,888 inhabitants, being three-eighths the total population. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.
Grand Turk claims, like so many other islands, have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by saltrakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

Industries.
Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered being about 2,000,000 bushels. The export of salt in 1898 was...
valued at £18,702, the quantity being 1,431,850 bushels. Sponges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There is one sponge curing establishment on the Caicos Islands. The cultivation of the Sisal fibre (or Pita plant) has been introduced, and has a fair prospect of success.

An agricultural settlement was started under Government auspices at Kew, North Caicos, in 1882, to grow fruit for export, but proved a failure, owing to the absence of any remunerative market for the produce. The soil elsewhere is totally unfit for agricultural purposes. Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. The commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than almost any of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had on the 31st December, 1898, 52 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 5,134 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the strong and never failing sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 82°, the extreme range being from 65° to 92°. The rainfall during 1898 amounted to 19 inches, the rainy season being from October to February. Hurricanes occasionally visit the groups.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Pickford and Black's steamers, running under Government contract, leave Halifax for Jamaica on the 15th of every month, calling at Grand Turk both going and returning. The length of voyage between England and Turks Islands is about fourteen days via New York, and eighteen days via Halifax or Jamaica.

The Olym Line from New York to Hayti calls at Great Turk every two or three weeks, the length of passage being six days. There are no railways or telegraph lines in the Colony.

The estimated number of letters to the United Kingdom is 3,000, and to all other countries 12,000 per annum.

The rate of letter postage is 2½d. per half ounce.*

There is no internal post.

Cable communication with Bermuda and Jamaica was established by the Direct West India Cable Company in January, 1898, the station being fixed at Grand Turk.

Education.

There are eight elementary schools supported by Government, with an attendance in 1898 of 692 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free. A compulsory education ordinance, providing also for the payment of fees, was passed in 1883, but the compulsory clauses have never been proclaimed.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict.

* Except to the U.K., India, and the countries included in the penny post agreement. See end of Introduction.

Constitution.

The legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this Board, but laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there.

The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.
