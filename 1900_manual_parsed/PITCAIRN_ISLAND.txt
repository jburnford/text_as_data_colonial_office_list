PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in
the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Aus-
tralia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long.), and
is contiguous to the low archipelago (Tua-
motu), which is supposed to have been first
discovered by Cartart in 1767, but remained un-
inhabited until 1780, when it was occupied by the
mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women
from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their
existence until the island was visited in 1808. No
regular government was established, but assist-
ance of various kinds was given during subsequent
visits of English vessels. In 1836, the population
having become larger than the island's resources,
the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own
request, removed, with all their possessions, to
Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In
1873 these had increased to 76, and in 1879 to 90.
The present population is 141.
