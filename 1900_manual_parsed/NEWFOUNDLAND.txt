NEWFOUNDLAND.

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 40,200 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Cape Chidley (Hudson's Strait) to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Quebec and the North-West Territories of the Canadian Dominion. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom) with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound. The temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,700 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportsmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, and Hebron. The customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norsemen and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton fishermen, it became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863, but has been discontinued for some years past. The collector of customs, who visits Labrador every summer in a revenue cruiser, is a J.P.; no other administration exists.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonize this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1629, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which is still in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brience, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claim the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they are allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right is an exclusive one has never been admitted by Great Britain, which also contends that it does not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain also undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it has not yet passed the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1895, then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in the Session 1898, the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December, 1899.

In August, 1898, Sir J. Bramston, K.C.M.G., and Admiral Sir J. E. Erskine, K.C.B., were appointed Royal Commissioners to enquire into the operation of the French treaties.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Copper is largely worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pilley's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the
NEWFOUNDLAND.

Interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead, silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported, while some English mining companies are now putting in the plant necessary to work other iron deposits on the north shore of Conception Bay.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends farther northward each year, including the east of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. In 1891 the number of men engaged was 53,502, including the subsidiary industries, with 1,242 vessels, of about 74,623 tons, besides 20,000 boats employed in the shore fisheries. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the value in 1890—was, from Newfoundland, $280,573 quintals, value $2,518,754; direct exports from Labrador, 15,5244 quintals, value $310,488, the total export of codfish therefrom being 1,135,817 quintals, value $2,824,242; 30 bank col go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general rate) per quintal would be 125. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, and Merchants' Bank of Halifax have been opened in St. John's, and a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Much of the trade is carried on by barter. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents.* Exchange $4.86¢ to the pound sterling.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $525,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance of 200 miles, is now complete, at a cost of $1,240,000. The line from Exploits Bay of Island and B. St. George to Port-aux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is also complete, the cost being $4,416,000. Branch lines to Brigus, Tilton, and Carbonear are now completed, while that to Burnt Bay is in course of construction. The total length of these lines will be about 33 miles. The trans-Atlantic cable is landed at St. John's, regular connection is made with the continent three times a week, the intervening strait being crossed in the first class passenger steamer "Bruce," which makes the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 1,914 miles of telegraph open, and cables start from Europe (at Heart's Content) and America (at Placentia). There is a fortnightly mail service (except in February).

*The currency has now been assimilated to that of Canada.

March and April) with Liverpool by the Allan line, and at irregular intervals by other steamers. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, and New York is made by private lines of steamers. Fortnightly mail service round the Island, two steamers running, one south and west, one north. One steamer makes fortnighty trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer. Smaller steamers ply on the four great bays, making close connection with the railway. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Europe, United States, and St. Pierre | per ½ oz. 5 cents. 1 " ditto |
| Miquelon | ditto |

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's in the year 1889 was 41°, the extreme range being from 1° to 82°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall averages 48 inches per annum. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Bethuk tribe.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1895, and the amendments in 1896 and 1899. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of appointed boards. There were in 1898 622 schools, with 28,397 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, but there is no provision for technical education.

In 1893 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object of fostering higher education in the colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature.

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 25,738 inhabitants (with suburbs, 29,067). The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 6,466; Twillingate has 3,565; Bona Vista 3,551; and Carbonear 4,127 inhabitants. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846 was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the cathedral, many government buildings, being burned down, with the public records which they contained. The town has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

*See end of Introduction. A new rate on parcels exchanged with the U.K. came into force on the 1st Jan. 1899.
Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council not to exceed 15 members, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1897—49,474 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding £500 in amount or value, or a net annual income of £100. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $120 each (President $240) per session. Members of the Assembly receive the following pay per session:—(1) Those living in St. John's, $200; (2) those living in the outports, $300. The speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The town of St. John's is governed by a municipal council consisting of three members, appointed by the general Government.
