GRENADE.

Situation, Area, &c.

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; it is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population (in 1891) of 6,190 souls.

General Description.

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and bushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. All the roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. There are about 40 miles of driven road in various sections, and a perfect network of by-roads, all in good order, provides for the important item of inland communication. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping, and had on 31st December, 1898, 73 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,074 tons; its fine harbour, owing to its situation, healthiness, and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call and coaling station for steamers. The town has a population of 5,000.

The other towns in the island are Charlotte Town (or Gouyave), Victoria (or Grand Pauvre), Sauteurs, and Grenville (or La Baye). English is universally spoken, but the peasantry speak among themselves a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race, except the East Indian population, which amounts to about 2,000 souls.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. Yellow fever, the bugbear of the West Indies, is almost unknown, and if new arrivals do get a touch of "acclimatizing fever," which is far from being the rule, it is mild and soon disappears. The average annual rainfall at St. George's for the last five years is 82.34 inches, and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer for the last five years are 87° and 67° respectively, the average mean temperature being 79.1° in the shade. The rainfall in other parts of the island is much greater; at the Grand Etang, in 1898, it was 167 inches.

The island is a great health resort for the neighbouring colony of Trinidad, and in addition to the restoring influence of the climate it affords excellent sea bathing.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planters' industry. Unlike the other islands however, it has long ceased to be a sugar-producing colony, and has therefore not suffered so severely as they have from the depreciation in the value of cane sugar. There are very few sugar estates at present in cultivation. The chief produce of Grenada is, and has been for some time, cocoa, of which 83,150 cwt., of the total value of 227,655l., were shipped in 1898. When the above shipment is compared with the shipments of 1885 (49,107 cwt.) and 1880 (42,154 cwt.), it will be seen that the cultivation of cocoa has increased. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such as coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, cocoanuts, &c. Nutmeg cultivation now occupies a prominent position, and is being largely developed. So general is the cultivation of spices, indeed, on the island that Grenada is already called "The Spice Island of the West." The export of spices has increased from 3,483l. in 1880, to 22,197l. in 1898. Tropical fruits of almost every description, and of the finest quality, are always abundant, and large quantities are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, taro, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, &c. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and all the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullet wood, locust, mahogany, white cedar, galba, &c., and large quantities of firewood are exported to Barbados. A considerable quantity of rum is manufactured for local consumption, but the total number of gallons in 1898 was only 32,622, an amount far below the average, and due to failure of the sugar cane crop from drought.

The main imports are food stuffs, textiles, timber, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are cotton and cotton seed, turtles and turtle-shell, hides and skins, fruit, and live stock (principally goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry).

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,653; estimated acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, under cultivation, 22,650.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George, established in 1881, with 699 depositors and 6,425l. deposited on 31st Dec., 1898. Branch banks were opened in the out districts on 1st April, 1889; the number of depositors on 31st December, 1898, was 354 and 2,425l. deposited.
History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with such severity that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674, the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1795-6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated and assisted by the French. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred in cold blood, and the Colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercromby suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the African slaves.

Constitution.

There was originally a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the Legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of £100 a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

The Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own induction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesties' wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council was established by the Queen, which now consists of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The unofficial members hold their seats for six years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and Grenada was made the head-quarters of the Government.

Education.

There are 9 Government elementary schools, and 28 aided schools. The latter are under the local management of the ministers of the different religious sects. Building grants have been made by the Government to assist in establishing schools in districts requiring them, and annual grants in aid are made on the result of inspections. The central administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1888 an Ordinance was passed imposing upon parents as a legal obligation the duty of providing elementary education for their children. In 1898 the average attendance was 4,398 children, the number on the rolls being 8,386. Fees are charged in all schools. There is a grammar school for boys, and two schools for the secondary education of girls, all of which receive grants in aid from the general revenue.

ST. LUCIA.

Situation and Area.

The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. Its 24 miles in length, and 12 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is 150 miles, and its area 233-29 sq. miles, rather less than Middlesex. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, contains about 1,200 houses, and a population of about 7,000 souls. Next in importance is the town of Soufriere, containing a population of about 2,300 souls.

History.

At the period of its discovery, St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1639, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English claimed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Carib to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718, the Agent, M. Ording, surrendered the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to recover possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Ilet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 86 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms, on the 4th of April, 1794.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Greenfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

General Description.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by intestine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect, and the population now amounts to about 47,352. Most of the inhabitants speak a
French patois, but English is gradually becoming more generally used. A very small percentage is of European descent, the remainder being of the negro race, except about 2,000 East Indian immigrants. The reputation of the island for peculiar sicknesses is undeserved. The average death rate for the years 1869-89 being less than 25 per 1,000. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation. The dangers from venomous reptiles is also much exaggerated. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are almost unknown. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbea Cordillera.

Castries, the chief town, has an excellent harbour, probably the best in the whole of the West Indies. It is now the second naval station of the Empire in these parts. Dredging operations have been carried out in the harbour, rendering the harbour more commodious. A substantial concrete wharf, 650 feet in length, with a depth alongside of 27 feet at low water, has been completed, and the western wharf having a length of 552 feet has been placed in wood, and dredged to an average depth alongside of 18 feet. The facilities offered by the port as a port of call and coaling station are fast being widely recognised. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1898, 11 vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 398 tons. It has been chosen as the chief coaling station for the fleet in the West Indies, and is being strongly fortified.

A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and has now 1,477 depositors, with 11,769£ to their credit on 31st December, 1898. Branch savings banks were opened at Soufrière and Vieux Fort in March, 1898, and on the 31st of December, 1898, there were 18£l. 10s. 5d. and 12£l. 15s. respectively to the credit of depositors.

The island was visited by a severe hurricane in Sept., 1898, which caused great destruction, and involved large numbers of people in destitution.

**Constitution and Law.**

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy. The Courts of Justice were an inferior Court called the "Sénéchausse," and a higher Court, called the "Conseil Supérieur," or Court of Appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided, and it was invested with certain executive and administrative functions.

The Government is now conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council. The Legislature consists of the Administrator and a Council composed as the Queen may direct. Law is administered by judge, from whom in civil cases there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Windward Islands; and two magistrates, whose decisions are liable to review by the judge. In criminal cases tried in the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of twelve men in England.

A code of local law, the authors of which are Sir G. W. Des Vignes, K.C.M.G., and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., became law in October, 1879. This code has been framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances. The Statute Law of the colony was consolidated in 1889 by Dr. J. W. Carrington, then Chief Justice.

**Education.**

On the 30th June, 1891, the trustees of the Lady Mico charity closed the eleven schools which they had till then maintained, and withdrew their connection with the colony. Three of these schools became Government schools, and the others assisted schools under the new Education Ordinance. In 1898 all the Government schools were handed over to the Roman Catholic body, and became assisted schools. There were, on the 31st December, 1898, 39 assisted schools. The number of children on the rolls was 5,280, and the amount spent by the colony on primary education was 2,639£. Two Government grants 200£ a year to Roman Catholic second-grade school, which had 53 pupils on the roll; and the sisters of St. Joseph conduct a similar school for girls, but receive no Government grant.

**Industry.**

Sugar, cocoa, logwood, and spices are produced. There are four sugar "Usines" with the best machinery. Tobacco is not grown as an article of export, but within the last two years the cultivation of this product has been revived, and is rapidly spreading.

Only about one-third of the island has ever been cultivated. The remainder is virgin forest of great fertility, and abounding in timber suitable for building and for the finest cabinet work.

Nearly all this land is in the possession of the Crown, and may be purchased in small or large lots as 1£ an acre, payable by annual instalments of 5s., *and in the event of a certain sum being put into permanent cultivation before the due date of the last instalment, that instalment may be remitted. This soil will grow any kind of tropical fruit trees or industrial plants.

There is at present in the colony an Indian population of about 2,000.

ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.

The Island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 35,600 acres of land; about half the area, or Middlesex, which is only about 13,600 acres is in cultivation. Some of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from St. Vincent.

General Description.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of about 4,000 souls. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1898, 26 vessels, of 410 tons.

St. Vincent, though exhibiting some features in common with the other islands, is favourably distinguished from many of them by an undulating surface, and a succession of gentle slopes, of which portions are cultivated for sugar-cane. Its most striking peculiarity is its "Soufrière," or volcanic mountain, celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and is about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded mountains traverses it from the Soufrière peak in the northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. The next highest peak in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond river.

In September, 1898, the island, in common with St. Lucia and Barbados, was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution.

Climate.

In the dry season, December to June, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy, and fever is almost unknown. The nights are cool all the year round. The average rainfall for last year (1898) is 114 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during 1898 was 88°, and the lowest 65°; the average mean temperature being 80° in the shade. The prevailing wind is N.E.

Industry and Communications.

Sugar, rum, cocoa, spices, and excellent arrow-root are produced. The cultivation of ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention. Most of the sugar and all the arrow-root mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivated land is owned by the firm; large tracts of Crown lands, which hitherto remained uncultivated are now in process of alienation to peasant proprietors. The forests produce excellent woods. There are 77 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne.

The principal towns are Kingstown, the capital, at the foot of Mount St. Andrew; Georgetown, in the Carib Country; and Chateaubetair, at the north-western end of the island.

A telephone system has been established, having 1 central and 7 branch exchanges, with 89 connections and about 129 miles of line.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like
some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No attempt, however, appears to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands. The Caribs continued sole masters of St. Vincent until the year 1675, when a number of savages of a different race were discovered in it. These received the appellation of "Black Caribs," to distinguish them from the aborigines, to whom the name of "Yellow Caribs" was given.

In 1722 George I made a grant to the Duke of Montagu of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities to the proportion to the value of 63,625l.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, the extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but then the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra," sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, at the British head-quarters.

The contest was carried on with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Roatan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,089, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400 and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of Coolie labourers in 1861. The indentures of these immigrants have expired, and most of them have returned to India. About 330 (including children born at St. Vincent) have made their home in the Colony.

**Constitution**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines, in 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members—five from the Legislative Council and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suitable under altered circumstances of the Colony, and in 1861 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abolished, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 888.

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47), by which the future machinery of self-government was left to the Crown. By an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, the Legislative Council now consists of four official and four nominated unofficial members.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is also the Judge of this court.

There were immediately before the hurricane 38 schools, with 7,509 children on the rolls, and an average attendance of 3,158. Most of the schoolhouses were destroyed, but are gradually being replaced. There is also a grammar school (for boys and girls), which receives a grant of 100l. per annum from the Government for boys, and a capital grant for girls, amounting in 1889 to 50l. 10s. 8½d.

The Government expenditure on education in 1898, including grant to grammar school, and salary, &c., of inspector was 2,298l.

A savings bank was established in 1865, and had 1,091 depositors, with 9,282l. deposited at 31st December, 1898.

APPENDIX TO PART II.

This Appendix gives some account of certain British Possessions and Protectorates which are not administered under the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA.*

The boundaries of this territory, as defined by the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement, are a line starting from the eastern shore of Lake Nyasa at the point of the parallel of the confluence of the Rivers Rovuma and Msinje, and following the shore southwards as far as 13° 30' S. lat., whence it runs S.E. to the eastern shore of Lake Chinta, which it follows; thence in a direct line to the eastern shore of Lake Chiwa, or Shiwana, where it follows to its south-easternmost point; thence in a direct line to the easternmost affluent of the River Ruo, and thence along that affluent, and subsequently the centre of the channel of the Ruo to its confluence with the River Shiré.

From the confluence of the Ruo and Shiré the boundary follows the centre of the channel of the latter river to a point just below Chiwanga, and thence due west to the watershed between the Zambezi and the Shiré, and follows the watershed between those rivers, and afterwards between the former river and Lake Nyasa, until it reaches south latitude 14°.

From thence it runs south-west to the point where south latitude 15° meets the River Aroangwa or Loanga, and follows the mid-channel of that river in conjunction with the Zambezi.

On the west the line follows the centre of the channel of the Upper Zambezi, starting from the Katima rapids up to the point where it reaches the territory of the Barute Kingdom. That territory to remain within the British sphere, and its limits to the westward, which will constitute the boundary between the British and Portuguese spheres of influence, are to be decided by a joint Anglo-Portuguese Commission.

In the early part of 1891 Her Majesty's Government extended the field of operations of the British South Africa Company's Charter so as to include the whole of the British sphere north of the Zambezi, except Nyasaland, under which name are included certain districts in the Lake Nyasa region, where British missionaries had been settled for over 15 years, and the African Lakes Company had been at work for the same period, and which in 1889 were declared to be within the British sphere of influence. On 14th May, 1891, the Nyasaland districts were proclaimed as being under the protectorate of Great Britain, their boundaries being thus defined:

On the east and south by the Portuguese dominions, and to the west by a frontier starting on the south from the point where the boundary of

*For much of the information as to this territory the Editor are indebted to Sir Harry H. Johnston, K.C.M.G., late Commissioner and Consul-General in the British Central Africa Protectorate. Additions and corrections have been made by Mr. Alfred Sharpe, C.B., present Commissioner and Consul-General.

the Portuguese dominions is intersected by the boundary of the Conventional Free Trade Zone, defined in the first article of the Berlin Conference Act, following that line northwards to the point where it meets the line of the geographical Congo basin, defined in the same article, and thence along the latter line to the point where it touches the boundary between the British and German spheres defined in the 2nd paragraph of the 1st article of the agreement of the 1st July, 1890.

British Central Africa is divided into the British Central Africa Protectorate, representing the country formerly known as Nyasaland, and the British Sphere of Influence beyond. The first-named is administered by a Commissioner and Consul-General, under the direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the second, now known as Northern Rhodesia, by the British South Africa Chartered Company.* All the officials who exercise magisterial duties hold a commission signed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The expenses of administering the Protectorate are borne partly out of local revenues, the balance being borne by the Imperial Government.

The Imperial Government (Admiralty) maintains a naval force on the Zambezi River, consisting of H.M. gunboats "Herald" and "Mosquito."

On the Upper Shiré river and on Lake Nyasa the Protectorate Administration maintains three gunboats, viz., the "Dove," side-wheeler, on the Upper Shiré, and the "Pioneer" and "Gwendolen" on Lake Nyasa. The last-named vessel is a large twin-screw steamer of 350 tons displacement.

There is a naval station kept up by the Admiralty at Chiunde, the only navigable mouth of the Zambezi, and at Chiromo, on the Shiré river. At Fort Johnston (south end of Lake Nyasa) there is an Administration naval station. At Chiunde is a small plot of land, known as the "British Concession," specially granted on lease by the Portuguese Government, where all goods in transit for British Central Africa are allowed to be transhipped free of custom duty.

The armed force necessary to maintain order within the Protectorate and the sphere of influence beyond, and to check the slave trade, consists of a corps of 200 Sikhs, seconded from active service in the Indian Army, and allowed to serve in British Central Africa for three years (being relieved by fresh arrivals at the end of that period of service), and also of 600 to 800 black police, locally recruited. This force is officered by English officers and Sikh N.C. officers. There is also a good armament of artillery and mountain guns supplied by the Imperial Government.

*For particulars as to the "British South Africa Company," see "Rhodesia" (under "South Africa").
Communications are maintained between British Central Africa and the sea (the chief "port" being Chiromo at the junction of the Rivers Ruo and Shiré) by H.M. gunboats, and by the river steamers of the African Lakes Company, Sharrer's Zambezi Traffic Company, the African International Flotilla Company, and the British Central Africa administration. These vessels meet at Chinde the ocean-going steamers of the Rennie Aberdeen line (London to Natal and Chinde), the German East Africa Steamship Company (whose steamers connect Chinde with Mozambique, Zanzibar, Southampton, and Bombay), the Portuguese Royal Mail service, and the Union Steamship Company.

The chief town of British Central Africa is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there is a population of about 100 Europeans and 6,000 natives. Other towns and settlements are: Zomba (the headquarters of the Administration), Chiromo, Katunga, Chikwawa, Mpimbì, Fort Lister, Fort Anderson, and Domasi, all more or less in the Shiré Highlands or on the River Shiré. Fort Johnston, Fort Maguire, Livingstonia, Bandawe, Likoma, Deep Bay, Fort Hill, and Karonga, are on or near Lake Nyasa; Fife, Abercorn, and Kituta are in the Tanganyika District; and Rhodesia and Mpata on Lake Mweru. The Mission settlements in the Shiré Highlands and on Lake Nyasa have schools attached to them. The chief colonies of Europeans are to be met with at these settlements; the total number of Europeans at present settled in British Central Africa is over 300, of whom about 280 are British subjects.

In the southern part of British Central Africa a number of Indian traders have already begun to establish themselves. The native population of the whole of British Central Africa is about 3,000,000, but large portions are devoid of a single human inhabitant owing to the fearful devastation caused in the past by the slave raids of the Arabs and black Portuguese. In fact it may be said that the native population, with the exception of the Barutse country (which is thickly populated), is chiefly congregated in that portion of the territory which is more or less under British administration.

The Shiré Province, which is that portion of the Protectorate lying between the south-west, south, and south-east shores of Lake Nyasa and the Zambezi, is now governed very much on the lines of a Crown colony. Good roads are being made in all directions, life and property are safe, and the bulk of the European population is congregated here. This province is remarkable for the extraordinary development of coffee planting which has taken place within the last few years; the coffee grown in the Shiré Highlands being of remarkable excellence. Formerly the chief trade on Lake Nyasa was in ivory, and elephants some years ago were fairly abundant all over B.C.A. At the present date, however, the amount of ivory collected in the Protectorate is very small, elephants having been very much thinned by the constant hunting carried on by natives. Coffee plantations are now being opened up on the western shores of Lake Nyasa, and this article forms the chief export, not only from the Shiré provinces, but also from Lake Nyasa.

During the year 1899 there was a considerable development of the india-rubber trade, and about 10,000£ worth was exported during that year. It is expected that this trade will largely increase. It is found, however, difficult to keep any check upon native rubber collectors who, regardless of the future, cut down the Llandolphia vines, from which the rubber is extracted.

Other articles of export from the Protectorate are oil seeds, rhinoceros horns, hippopotamus teeth, strophantus seeds, rice, &c. The latter article is grown on the shores of Lake Nyasa in great perfection; the Administration has recently introduced the cultivation of wheat, which promises to be very successful. It has also introduced oats and barley, which thrive remarkably on the uplands, and has also made experiments with merino sheep and Natal ponies, both of which kinds of stock seem likely to prosper on the elevated plateau.

The climate is on the whole healthier than that of many parts of tropical Africa, but cannot be called salubrious for Europeans generally, chiefly owing to the prevalence of malarial fevers.

A good deal of the sickness seems to arise from the malaria caused by tilling the soil for the first time, and the health records show that as the country becomes opened up it proves much healthier for Europeans than in its virgin state. Curiously enough, most of the complaints arise from cold and not from heat, which is nowhere very excessive, except on one or two days in the height of the summer. On the elevated plateaus and mountain ranges, which represent so large a proportion of the territory, the climate is chilly, especially during the winter months, and fires are burned nearly all the year round in the Europeans' houses.

The attention of capitalists is being directed to the great possibilities of trade on the Zambezi and the waterways connecting it with the lakes.

Surveys for a railway to connect Chiromo with Blantyre and Lake Nyasa have been completed. Telegraphic communication has been established from the Cape, via Matabeleland, Mashonaland, and Tete (on the Zambezi), with Blantyre, Zomba, and several other stations in the Protectorate. The telegraph wire, which is the property of the African Transcontinental Telegraph Company, passes through the Protectorate from south to north, crosses the Tanganyika plateau, and had, in the month of June, 1899, reached Lake Tanganyika. From the south end of that lake it will be quickly carried on up its eastern shores to the north end, and thence to the Nile.

The total imports into the B.C.A. Protectorate for the year ending March 31st, 1899, were 99,290£, and exports 35,623£, in addition to which there were goods passed through the Protectorate in transit for various countries to the value of 27,801£. The total revenue raised in the country amounted to 31,314£.
