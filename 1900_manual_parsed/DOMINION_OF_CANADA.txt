DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, were by the Imperial Act 30-31 Vic., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd of May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vic., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16 May, 1871, issued under the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieut.-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba), were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieut.-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the
Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada, from the 1st of Sept., 1860, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1892, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the Queen, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of government, until the Queen shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 81 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for senator is the possession of property worth £1,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces and by the increase in population, and is now 213; 92 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 29 Nova Scotia, 14 New Brunswick, 7 Manitoba, 6 British Columbia, 5 Prince Edward Island, and 4 The Territories. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives £1,000 per annum, and each member of the Commons £10 a day during the session, with a maximum of £1,000 per session. A parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot and the franchise is regulated by the several Provincial Legislatures, which also regulate the polling divisions and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from February to May.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials who possess the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec, and Nova Scotia, there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The provincial legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. There is a legislative assembly in the North-West Territories, consisting of 26 elected members. After 1st October, 1877, an executive council will be established as in the other provinces. The territory not comprised within any province (such as the North-East Territory and the Arctic Islands) is very thinly inhabited, and is administered by the Minister of the Interior at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the provincial legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the provincial legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the Probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, according to each decennial census till the population in each province reached 400,000. Each Province also receives an annual allowance for Government, and for interest on the amount by which its debt at the Union fell short of the authorised amount.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislatures require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed, within a year, by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the Queen.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of
North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been opened.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In Ontario the system is to be found in the most complete and symmetrical form, towards which the others closely approximate. The organization comprises (1) townships or rural districts of 8 or 10 square miles an average population of about 3,000 souls, administered by a reeve and 4 councillors; (2) villages with a population of 750, governed like the township; (3) towns with a population over 2,000, governed by the mayor and 3 councillors for each ward if there are less than five wards, and 2 councillors if more than five. The Reeves, deputy Reeves, mayors, and councillors are all elected annually by the ratepayers. Above these stands the county municipality consisting of the Reeves and deputy Reeves of the townships, villages, and towns within the county, one of these who presides being called "Warden" of the county. Alongside the county stands the "city" with a population of over 10,000, governed by a municipal body of mayor and 3 aldermen for every ward, with powers and functions akin to those of counties and towns combined. The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except Labrador, see page 166, and Alaska, which belongs to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,653,946 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly 4 times that of British India), exclusive of the area of the Arctic islands (District of Franklin), which is unknown. The greater part of this area is comprised in the North West Territories. The seven older Provinces of the Dominion comprise a little over 1,000,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

Population of Dominion.

| 1871 | 3,695,524 | 4,324,810 |
| 1881 | 4,324,810 | 4,833,239 |

A census of Manitoba was taken in 1896, and the population found to be 193,425.

About 1,400,000 of the people are of French extraction, over one million two hundred thousand of these residing in Quebec, where French is the usual language spoken.

The total population includes about 110,000 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories, and there are about 14,000 half breeds. They are under the supervision of government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs. There are over 9,000 Chinese in Canada, most of whom are in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

There was no debt in the North-West Territories, Manitoba had a surplus of assets of $3,000,000, and Prince Edward Island has a surplus of nearly $500,000. If the above amount is added to the net Federal debt on 30th June, 1898, the total net indebtedness of the Dominion is found to be $295,415,472, or about $56 per head of the population.

More than $109,000,000 of the Public debt was incurred either by the assumption by the Dominion of the existing Provincial debts, or by the allowance of debts to Provinces in accordance with the terms of confederation and subsequent Acts.

Wales were at once admitted to the advantage of the reduced scale, and the concession had subsequently to be extended to all countries entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment by Canada. On the 1st August, 1898 (the commercial treaty with the U.K. being then in force and the privilege having previously expired) this arrangement came to an end, and under the Tariff Act of 1898 a rebate of 25 per cent. was granted to the U.K. and the West Indies specifically, and to such other countries in the British Empire as accorded to Canada a treatment as favourable as the reduced Tariff.

The manufactured articles produced in Canada in 1881 equaled $71.61 per head of the population, and in 1891, $98.52 per head.

Industry.

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. About $10,000,000 are invested in the manufacture of wood pulp, an industry which has grown with great rapidity in recent years. Coal and gold (in British Columbia, the Yukon Territory, and Nova Scotia) and copper (principally in Ontario) are extensively worked. Valuable nickel and phosphate mines exist. Shipbuilding is an important industry, and besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments. The principal imports are textile manufactures, coal, hardware, tea, sugar, raw cotton, hides, and tobacco.

The yield of Canadian fisheries since 1890 was as follows:

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1890 | $17,714,902 |
| 1891 | $18,977,878 |
| 1892 | $18,941,171 |
| 1893 | $20,686,661 |
| 1894 | $21,719,573 |
| 1895 | $20,198,338 |
| 1896 | $20,407,425 |
| 1897 | $22,783,546 |

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is estimated at 78,959.

The arrivals and clearances were in 1898 a total tonnage of 24,746,116 engaged in outside trade, and 29,633,950 tons engaged in coasting trade.

Tonnage of vessels on Register Books of the Dominion, 31st December, 1898, was 690,523 tons register, of which 4,747 sailing ships were 538,123 tons, and 1,893 steamers 160,664 tons. The number of seamen employed was about 120,000.

In 1897 the number of light stations was 653; of lighthouses 816; of fog whistles 22, and of automatic fog horns 40.

Railways.

The length of railways actually constructed in the Dominion on 30th June, 1898, was 16,870 miles. Canada ranks eighth in absolute mileage among the states and kingdoms of the world possessing railway systems. The total capital invested amounted to $941,297,037 on 30th June, 1898. The total quantity of goods carried in the year 1898 amounted to 28,785,903 tons. The number of passengers was 18,444,049, and the distance travelled by trains was 50,688,283 miles. The total receipts were $59,715,105 and working expenses $39,137,549.

The Dominion Government owns and maintains 1,314 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $55,670,204. The working expenses in 1898 were $3,257,648, and the receipts $3,117,670.

There are 40 Electric Railways in Canada. These ran about 28,000,000 car miles, and carried nearly 100,000,000 passengers, or 32 passengers per mile run.

In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, via Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and a monthly mail service between Vancouver and Hong Kong, via Yokohama which has been subsidised by the Imperial and Dominion Government to the extent of $300,000 has been established.

Telegraphs.

There are 29,548 miles of telegraph line, and 78,790 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 2,786 are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 4,449,765 messages were sent in 1898 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 2,746, being one to every 2,000 of the population. Canada ranks eighth in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. The telephone is very generally used. There are 63 telephone companies in operation throughout the Dominion, with 80,000 miles of wire; 45,000 sets of instruments; and over 90,000,000 connections.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. The total length of canals proper open is 262½ miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts in 1898 were $407,663, and the working expenses, including repairs, $484,351. Seventy-two and a half million dollars have been expended on the construction of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

Currency and Banking.

There is a uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills, $4.864 being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

There are Government savings banks in the maritime provinces, and in Manitoba and British Columbia, having 46,093 depositors, with $15,630,180 on deposit. There are also Post Office savings banks in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and North-West...
Territories, and British Columbia, having 142,289 depositors, with $34,480,938.

The total amount of savings bank deposits, including two operating under special charters, was $65,593,219 on 30th June, 1898.

The paid-up banking capital has nearly doubled since 1870. In June of that year it was $32,050,597, and in June, 1899, it was $63,674,085. The average bank note circulation for the year 1899, was $39,097,708. In 1877 they held $69,763,666 of deposits, and in June 1899, they held $261,381,492. In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and the average monthly circulation in 1890 amounted to $15,501,360, and in 1898 to $28,238,707. The maximum Government issue is fixed at twenty-five million dollars, and the minimum reserve in specie and British Government securities is fixed at 25 per cent., but for all amounts over twenty million, gold must be held dollar for dollar. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government.

**Post Office.**

The number of letters sent in Canada in the year ended 30th June, 1898, was 134,975,000, of postcards 28,153,000, and of newspapers (other than those sent from the office of publication, which are all carried free), periodicals, &c., 26,595,000. The number of letters per head of population was 25:70. The number of offices was 9,282. The revenue for 1898 was $4,686,650, and the expenditure $4,734,255.

There is weekly mail communication with Great Britain, via Quebec or Halifax, fortnightly with the West Indies and Demerara, and four a week via New York. There is a through daily service by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Pacific coast, a monthly direct steam service with Australia, and a bi-monthly steam service with Japan and China.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers | News-papers |
|---------------------|------------|
| Canada and U.S. ... | 2 1 per 4 oz. |
| U.K., India, Newfoundland, and certain other Colonies* | 2 1 per 2 oz. |
| Elsewhere ... ... ... | 5 1 " |

There is a parcels post to Newfoundland, West Indies, Australia, Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan.

**Defence.**

There is an Imperial naval station at Halifax, N.S., which is strongly fortified, and defended by a garrison of 1,500 men. The defence of the Dominion rests, however, with the local forces. The Canadian Militia since confederation has, in accordance with the Canadian Militia Act, been under the immediate command of a Major-General of the English Army. The Dominion is divided, for military purposes, into twelve districts, with a Deputy Adjutant-General, and a Brigade Staff in charge of each. The permanent Militia numbers 986, and the active Militia 36,650. The reserve Militia consists of all adult males between 18 and 60 (with certain exceptions) who are not serving in the active Militia. There are included in this force 13 batteries of garrison artillery, and 17 of field artillery, 2 companies of engineers, and 38 squadrions, two schools of cavalry, and four of infantry, and the Dominion Government in 1870 established a school of scientific military instruction at Kingston, known as "The Royal Military College," with a staff of 12 professors.

Esquimalt, in British Columbia, has become an important coaling station, and is strongly fortified and garrisoned by Colonial Artillery and Royal Marines.

**Chief Towns.**

The cities and towns in the Dominion having more than 10,000 inhabitants in 1897 were as follows: Montreal (250,000); Toronto (195,987); Quebec (75,000); Ottawa (55,000); Hamilton (50,038); Halifax (45,000); St. John, N.B.

(10,574); Stratford (10,500); Belleville (10,400); St. Catharines (10,500); Moncton (10,110); Sherbrooke (10,065); Vancouver, B.C. (20,000, estimated).

Dawson, in the Yukon Territory, which in 1897 did not exist, has a population of about 4,500.

II. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada was discovered by Sebastian Cabot in
1497. In 1525, the French took possession of the
country in the name of the King of France, and
ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence,
so naming that splendid river from having entered
it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded.
During their early days and for a considerable time
after, the French settlers were few in number,
suffered great hardships, and were much engaged
in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal
inhabitants. The principal incentives to their
colonization were the profits of the fur trade and
missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces
under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole terri-
tory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the
Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for
three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been
in English possession, having been captured by
David Kirk, but was retro-ceded to France by the
peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774, Canada was governed by
military authority, until in the latter year a nominee
council was established by Act of the Parliament
of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman
Catholics were given the free exercise of their
religion: the Catholic Clergy were declared entitled
to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but
with respect only to those professing the Catholic
religion; and in civil cases it was declared that
resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the
decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31
Geo. III., cap. 31), dividing Canada into two
Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and lower
Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitu-
tion for each. As the form of government was
similar in each Province, a description of that of
the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1838. The most fruitful causes of dissension were the right of the Assembly to control public expenditure, and the question of the "Clergy Reserves," lands appropriated by the Imperial Act of 1791 for the exclusive benefit of the Anglican Clergy. The immediate exciting cause of the Rebellion was the establishing, by Governor Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton) of 37 rectories in Upper Canada. After the reduction of the insurgents, the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 and 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. The new House of Assembly consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1854 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "dead lock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in council, advised by five or more cabinet ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 92 members; Quebec 65 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $6 per day for 30 days or a maximum of $80. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in council. The members are paid $6 per day while the session lasts, and their travelling expenses.

**Industry.**

The land in both Ontario and Quebec is very fertile, and produces all cereals and wheat crops in abundance; fruit grows luxuriantly; and grapes, melons, peaches and tomatoes come to maturity in the open air. In 1897 Canada ranked first in the shipment of cheese to Great Britain, supplying over one-half of the total imports of the article.

The lumber trade is extensive; and manufactures of hardware and textile fabrics are largely carried on.

**Education.**

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for both the elementary (public) and high schools, of which there are 6,126, with 506,515 scholars in 1897. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational), university (Toronto) with an affiliated university college, and three theological colleges are also affiliated, and one university is confederated. There are also five denominational colleges with university powers in the province, and numerous high schools or colleges for girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics' institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were in 1897, 5,848 schools, with 307,280 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

**Chief Towns, Area, and Population.**

Besides those mentioned at p. 60, the chief towns are, in Ontario, Owen Sound, Galt, Brockville, Berlin and Woodstock; and in Quebec, St. Hyacinthe, St. Cunegonde, Three Rivers and Levis, with from 8,000 to 10,000 inhabitants each. The area of the two Provinces, including water, is 569,350 square miles—Ontario 222,000, and Quebec 347,350.* The population according to the last census was—Ontario 2,114,321, and Quebec 1,488,553.

**Climate.**

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°, at Montreal

* The northern boundaries of Quebec were extended by Federal Parliament Act, cap. 3, 1898, and Quebec Legislature Act, c.p. 6, 1899.
The extreme range being from 12° below zero to 91°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 27 inches, at Montreal, 27 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between Dec. and March is considerable.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the last census was 450,523.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander by James I. in 1627. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of the province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

The harbour of Halifax has an area of about 10 square miles, is open at all seasons, and its navigation is scarcely ever interrupted by ice. This harbour is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for, it is said, 1,000 ships. The British Government has an extensive dockyard at Halifax, which is its principal naval station in North America. Some of the other chief towns are Annapolis, Antigonish, Digby, Kentville, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney (in Cape Breton), Amherst, Lunenburg and Liverpool.

The climate is remarkably healthy, and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion, but fogs prevail on the coast at certain seasons. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°. The average annual rainfall is 34 inches, evenly distributed.

Coal and iron ore are plentiful, and gold also has been discovered, and is yielding fair returns; but the greater portion of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and the growth of fruit. The superior fisheries, together with the ship-building and timber trades, give occupation to many.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 21 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected every five years. The Members are paid $500 sessional indemnity.

Education.

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the
ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by the Town Council, or a committee thereof.

In 1892 there were 2,281 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 87,189 pupils. Education is compulsory, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 45° 5' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 47' and 67° 53' W. long.; its area is 27,700 square miles, or about 17,000,000 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population on 5th April, 1891, was 321,263.

History.

New Brunswick, in the early part of the last century, belonged to the French, and was called by them New France. At the peace of 1763, New Brunswick, with the rest of Canada, was ceded by France to Great Britain, and was annexed to Nova Scotia until 1785, when it was erected into a separate Colony. It was first colonized by British subjects in 1761, and in 1783 by disbanded troops from New England.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 40°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 82°. The average annual rainfall is 35 inches, and the snowfall 158 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant; antimony, iron, and gypsum are to be found also in very large quantities. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 80 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 7,000), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 46,000). Other towns are Moncton (9,000), Chatham (5,000), Woodstock (3,000), and St. Stephen (3,000).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 14 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 46 members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $300 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 5 and 20. There were 1,737 schools, with 66,917 scholars in attendance, in 1897. In 1898 there were 68,239 children on the school rolls.

There is a university at Fredericton, and several colleges.

MANITOBA AND KEWATIN.

Situation and Area.

Manitoba was erected into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vic., c. 3, taking effect on 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-99° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.
By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°–53° N. lat. and 90°–101° W. long., comprising an area of 73,956 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 62,260, which had grown to 154,442 in 1891, and is now nearly 200,000.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St. Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

The district of Keewatin, the eastern boundaries of which were recently defined by the settlement of western boundaries of Ontario, comprises all the country east of the Great MacKenzie River Basin, north of Manitoba, and west of Ontario, and has a population of about 5,000 Indians and whites, was in 1876 placed under the government of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, who is empowered by the Keewatin Act chap. 53, of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, to appoint justices of the peace and otherwise arrange for the administration of justice. Intoxicants are by this Act absolutely prohibited.

History.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, incited by disaffected persons, rose in insurrection, and established a provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection, having previously imprisoned 39 Canadians, shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871 the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid, but it was arrested by the United States Commander at Fort Pembina on the International Boundary.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence for two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of this province are very highly spoken of. The soil is a rich black loam, peculiarly adapted to the growth of wheat. A variety of "hard wheat" known as Red Fife, is grown throughout the province generally, which is very much in demand amongst millers, for the purpose of mixing with softer varieties. Coal of the lignite description and good building clay have been discovered in the Souris Valley.

In the eastern part of the province exist large bodies of gold-bearing quartz, that are being gradually opened up. Many veins are now being successfully worked. Iron ore exists in large quantities on the islands of Lake Winnipeg, and salt springs on the shores of Lake Winnipegosiss.

The northern part of the province is heavily timbered.

The growth of Winnipeg, the chief city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 260 inhabitants. In 1881 it had a population of about 10,000; in 1896, 35,000; and now over 50,000. The other chief towns are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Minnedosa, and Morden.

Free-grant lands are still available in sections opened up by new railways, while good farms can be purchased from $2 to $10 per acre.

During the six years since 1890 wheat has produced on an average 20 bushels per acre, oats 56¼, barley 29½.

At the present time (1892) there are 35,000 farmers in the province, and they have in crop 2,449,078 acres, chiefly as follows:

| Crop          | Acres   |
|---------------|---------|
| Wheat         | 1,629,995 |
| Oats          | 575,136  |
| Barley        | 182,912  |
| Flax          | 21,780   |
| Potatoes      | 19,151   |
| Roots         | 10,079   |

Total of all kinds ... 2,449,078

Railway Facilities.

In the year 1879 there was no railway at all in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains.

In the year 1895 there were in the province of Manitoba alone 1,680 miles of railway, which afford easy access to market from all parts of the province.

Climate.

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 inches, and snowfall (November to April), 53 inches.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 4 members in the Dominion Senate and 7 members in the House of Commons.

The province has a Legislative Assembly of 40 members elected by manhood suffrage for 4 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber, was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876.

The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control was in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively. The local management was entrusted to school trustees elected by the people.

By the "Public Schools Act," of 1890, all the previous school Acts were repealed, and a system of national non-sectarian schools was established throughout the province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school."

In 1898 there were 1,250 schools in operation, employing 1,301 teachers, of whom 654 were men, and 647 women, with 44,070 pupils.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one university, styled "The University of Manitoba," with examining and degree-conferring powers only. The affiliated Colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical College.

**BRITISH COLUMBIA**

**Situation and Area**

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian down to the 54th parallel, thence by summit of Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean—the average breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of coast line 700 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 383,000 square miles, and the population at the census of 1891 was 98,173, and is now approximately 150,000.

**History**

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island, discovered in 1762, was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and six in the House of Commons, of Canada.

**Constitution**

The Provincial Government is administered by a lieutenant-governor and legislative assembly of 38 members on the system of executive administration known as a "Responsible Government." The assembly is elected for four years, every British male adult having resided 6 months in the Province, duly registered, being entitled to vote. Members receive $600 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

**Description**

The population is about 150,000, of whom 25,000 are Indians, and 7,000 Chinese.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly
12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains: the climate is for the most part drier, and the snow fall consequently less.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; the exports amount to over seventeen million dollars annually (a remarkable fact considering the number of the population); they consist of minerals (chiefly gold, silver and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon and oil), timber, furs, skins, &c. The imports amount to upwards of eight and a half million dollars, principally from Eastern Canada, England, the United States, China, Australia, &c.

The mineral production of the province to the end of 1898 amounts in value to $123,417,326, towards which sum coal has contributed $10,306,160.

A great advance has been made in metalliferous mining; the oldest districts have increased their production, while new fields have been opened up; this advance is clearly shown by the increase in the production of the year 1898 over 1896, which is as follows: 1896, $1,801,205; 1898, $10,906,561.

There has been a corresponding increase in the population; some of these new mining districts, which a year or two ago were only inhabited by a few hardy prospectors, are now dotted with active and prosperous mining towns.

The chief towns are Victoria (24,000) and Nanaimo, city and neighbourhood (8,000), the seat of the coal-mining industry on Vancouver Island. On the mainland, New Westminster (9,000), and Vancouver (25,000), Rossland and Trail (8,000), Nelson (3,000), Kaslo (1,600), Sandon (1,500). These towns are in West Kootenay. On the Canadian Pacific Railway, Kamloops (1,700), Ashcroft, Revelstoke, and Donald are thriving places. Esquimalt, V.I., is a coaling station, and is the site of a large dry dock and naval dockyard.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction composed of the members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in city school districts seven trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present four high schools in the province, employing twelve teachers.

The number of schools in operation in 1897–98 was 261, under 422 teachers, with an enrolment of 17,668 pupils.

The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated but no religious dogma nor creed is permitted to be taught.

School districts are formed wherever there are twenty children between the ages of six and sixteen years available for school purposes.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, &c. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (11,373), and Summerside (3,600). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches.

**Constitution.**

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $160 per annum, and $12 for postage, besides travelling expenses.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and five in the House of Commons.

**Education.**

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a Chief Superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 468 schools, with 21,892 scholars. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic College not under the control of the Government.

**Finance.**

The Province has a large sum to its credit, from which it draws interest. There is a Provincial Tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also statute labour on the roads, or commutation money therefor in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North Western Territory were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The territories are governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

In 1888, election by popular vote was applied to the Assembly 621 members being returned. In September, 1894, the Territories included in the Provisional Districts of Alberta, Assiniboia and Saskatchewan were reorganized under a local ordinance and divided into electoral districts returning 29 members to the Legislative Assembly, from among whom an executive committee consisting of 4 members was chosen to aid and advise the Lieut.-Governor in the government of the territories. By an amendment to the Act in 1897 an Executive Council was authorised to assume office on 1st October, 1897, the members thereof being obliged to receive the approval of their constituents. This body now advises the Lieutenant Governor upon all matters appertaining to local administration in the Territories. The Assembly elects its own speaker. The Territories have rapidly grown in wealth and importance in recent years, and immigration has been largely on the increase.

Elementary education is provided for by a Council of Public Instruction, consisting of the members of the Executive Council of the Territories, and four persons appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, empowered by the School Ordinance, 1892. School districts can be organised in areas not exceeding 25 sq. miles, where there are at least four heads of families, and a population of at least 12 children of school age. School districts are administered by three trustees elected by the residents, except in town municipalities, in which five Trustees are elected. Liberal aids, amounting to about 50 per cent of the cost of maintenance, are given to school districts by Government. The number of public schools is 564, with 18,174 pupils.

The Territories were divided in 1882 into four provisional districts; viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. Regina (the capital) is in the district of Assiniboia, and has a population of about 2,000. The boundaries of these districts were defined as follows:

Assiniboia, bounded on the east by Manitoba, on the north by latitude 52°, on the west by longitude 110° and on the south by latitude 49° (89,535 sq. miles).
Saskatchewan, bounded on the south by Assini...
boia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson River, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by longitude 110 (107,092 sq. miles).

Alberta, bounded on the south by latitude 49, on the east by Assiniboina and Saskatchewan, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by British Columbia (106,100 sq. miles).

Athabasca, bounded on the south by Alberta, on the east by longitude 110 and the Athabasca River, on the north by latitude 60, and on the west by British Columbia (104,300 sq. miles).

By Proclamation, 2nd Oct., 1895, the unorganized and unclaimed Territories were divided into provisional districts for postal and other purposes, and four such districts were established, viz.—

1. The district of Ungava, bounded on the north by Hudson Strait, on the west by the east coast of Hudson Bay and James Bay, on the south by the Province of Quebec, and on the east by the boundary between Canada and the dependency of Newfoundland, and on the Labrador coast, all islands within a distance of three miles from the shores of Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay, and James Bay to be included.

2. The district of Franklin, beginning at Cape Best, at the entrance to Hudson Strait from the Atlantic; thence westerly through said strait, Fox Channel, Gulf of Boothia, Franklin Strait, Ross Strait, Simpson Strait, Victoria Strait, Dease Strait, Coronation Gulf, and Dolphin, and Union Strait to a point in the Arctic Seas in longitude 125° 30' west, latitude 71 degrees north; and thence northerly including Baring Land, Prince Patrick Island, and the Polynæa Island; thence north-easterly to the "farthest of Commander Markham's and Lieut. Parr's sledge journey" in 1876, in longitude about 63½ degrees west, and latitude about 83½ degrees north; thence southerly through Borden's Channel, Kennedy Channel, Smith Sound, Baffin Bay, and Davis Strait to the beginning.

3. The district of Yukon (now famed for its gold fields), to include the region marked off by the northern boundary of British Columbia, the eastern boundary of Alaska, the Arctic Ocean, and a line drawn from the westerly mouth of the Mackenzie River, due south to the parallel to the Mackenzie River to the range of mountains striking them at their intersection with their 136th meridian; thence south along the range to the Laird River at the British Columbia boundary.

4. The district of Mackenzie, including the territory south of the Arctic Ocean and North of British Columbia and Athabasca, as extended to the 110th meridian, a line along which to the southern line of Franklin constitutes the eastern boundary.

It was at the same time provided that there be added to the district of Athabasca the region north of Saskatchewan to the 100th meridian, thence north along the 100th meridian to the southern boundary of Mackenzie.

The district of Mackenzie has an area approximately of 538,000 square miles, the district of Yukon an approximate area of 200,000 square miles, and the extended district of Athabasca an area of 265,000.

The boundaries of the Yukon district were more closely defined by a Proclamation of the 16th August, 1897. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 61-62 Vict., cap. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate Territory, arrangements being made for its local administration by a Commissioner under instructions given by Order in Council or the Minister of the Interior.

The population of the territories was (1898) estimated at 130,000.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply to the Territories also. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Alberta than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that the Territories have over 150,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement.
