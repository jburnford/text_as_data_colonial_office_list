THE GAMBIA.

Situation and Area.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 13° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Colony on the river Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary, British Kommbo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, and McCarthy's Island, situated between the falls of Barra Creek and Bathurst, and 153 miles distant from the latter. This island forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river. The total area of the Colony proper is about 69 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey). The Protectorate extends on both banks of the river for 200 miles from its mouth.

History.

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators, but they made no settlement.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in Exeter to trade with the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed for this. It was not successful, and another established two years later also failed. In 1670 a fort was built on the island, now known as Fort James.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade (1807) till 1816, when a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary by British merchants from Senegal and the town of Bathurst commenced.

The right of trade was abandoned to England by France in the treaty of 1783, with the exception of a French factory which was subsequently established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. These two exceptional rights were exchanged in 1857.

From 1807 the settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821, till in 1843 it was created an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, and continued so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate Government in 1881.

McCarthy's Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826 and 1832; St. Mary's Island was ceded in 1827; and British Kommbo was granted by the King of Kommbo in various sessions in 1840, 1850, and 1855.

Industry.

The principal productions of the settlement and of the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, beeswax, rice, cotton maize, corn, palm kernels, indiarubber, wax, and native "pagns" or country cloths. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into native cloths called pagns, the manufacture of vegetable oils, boat building, and some brick making, there are no manufacturing industries in the country.

A considerable entrepôt trade is done with the French settlements and the adjoining coast districts, in cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, rice, cola nuts, and hardware.

In 1898 the imports and exports were as follows:

| Weight          | Value   |
|-----------------|---------|
| Cotton goods    | £60,787 |
| Tobacco         | 7,190   |
| Kola Nuts       | 21,639  |
| Spirits         | 4,873   |
| Wines           | 1,611   |
| Sugar           | 2,568   |
| Salt            | 997     |
| Gunpowder       | 970     |
| Rice            | 38,226  |

| Weight          | Value   |
|-----------------|---------|
| Ground nuts     | £200,309|
| Rubber          | 30,468  |
| Palm kernels    | 919     |
| Wax             | 1,833   |
| Hides           | 311     |

Most of the exports go to France, but half of the imports come from England. Bathurst is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1897, 114 vessels registered, of 1,993 tons in the aggregate. The ground nut is the staple product of the Settlement. It is planted in June, and reaped in November, and largely exported to the South of Europe for the extraction of oil. In 1837, 671 tons were exported, in 1858 15,729 tons, in 1898, 33,000 tons.

Relations with the Interior.

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the Protectorate by the Anglo-French Commissioners in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the Protectorate gradually into closer relationship with the Government of the Colony. An Order-in-Council, issued on the 23rd of November, 1893, provided for the establishment of Her Majesty's jurisdiction within the Protectorate, and since then an Ordinance has been passed providing for the establishment of magistrates and also native courts.

Travelling Commissioners regularly, during the eight months of dry weather, travel through the Protectorate on both banks of the river for 200 miles, and in Kommbo and Fongoli. These parts of the Protectorate are gradually getting more under the immediate control of the Government. A "yard" or "hut" tax, which averages about 4s. per annum for a family, has been recently imposed in the Protectorate.

Stipends are now only paid in a few cases, and presidals are occasionally made to the more influential chiefs, in return for their services in preserving peace and keeping the trade routes open.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is that of the Latin Union; there is no Colonial coinage and no note issue. A Government savings bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st Dec., 1897, 2,562l. deposited by 169 depositors, in 1898, 3,822l.
THE GAMBIA.

deposited by 192 depositors, but there are no private banks.

Education.

The schools, which are wholly in the hands of the several denominations, receive grants in aid. There is one Anglican school, 8 Mohammedan, 3 Wesleyan, and 2 Roman Catholic, with about 1,400 scholars in all. Education is not compulsory and fees are charged.

Means of Communication.

The Liverpool mail steamers call every fortnight. Four telegraph cables place Bathurst in communication with Europe and West Africa. There are no railways, internal telegraphs, or metalled roads, save one from Bathurst to Cape St. Mary, 7½ miles across the Oyster Creek Bridge, which connects the island of St. Mary with the mainland of British Kombo. Horses will live, and the river forms an unrivalled highway for 250 miles. The roads in the Protectorate are kept clear, and light traps or bicycles could pass along in those districts, which are free from swamps. A Government steamer now runs weekly to and from McCarthy's Island, stopping at intermediate places, carrying 1st-class passengers at 2d. per mile and deck passengers at 1d. per mile, letters at 1d. each, and affording freight and towage according to a fixed tariff.

The postage of letters to the United Kingdom, India, and certain Colonies* is 1d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post.
