TASMANIA.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in fair order by the Government. All the other main roads are under the control of municipal boards and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the treasury. In 1898 the maintenance of main roads cost £5,069l., of cross and bye roads £22,129l., in all £27,198l.

Roads.

There are now 5,083 miles of railway in the colony constructed, mainly on the three feet six inch gauge. Of this 5,083 miles of railway, 122 miles were purchased from the Tasmanian Main Line Railway Company at a cost of £1,106,500l., paid for by inscribed stock, bearing interest at the rate of 3½ per cent, redeemable in 1940. The total cost of railway construction, including cost of 7¼ miles owned by private company, but worked by government, up to 31st Dec., 1898, was £3,931,611l., the gross receipts in 1898 being £22,110l., and the working expenses £65,687l., showing a return of 1½ per cent. on the capital.

Railways.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is £1 an acre; and the upset price of second-class lands is a sum not less than £6 an acre.

Land.

Under Crown Lands Act, 1899 (54 Vic., No. 8), any person of the full age of 18 years may select, for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not exceeding 320 acres, at £1 an acre, with 33 per cent added for credit, payable by annual instalments for 14 years. Under Crown Lands Amendment Act, 1893 (57 Vic., No. 12), any person of the age of 18 who has not selected or purchased under Crown Lands Act, 1899 (54 Vic., No. 8) may take up land not exceeding 10 acres, or 100 acres, on payment of survey fee, and no further payment is to be made until the fourth year. But a grant cannot be issued for the land unless improved to the extent of £1 for every acre or unless resided upon for the first term of 18 years, inclusive of the 3 years' free occupation.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above £1l.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, copper, hides, skins, and leather, hops, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark. The value of the principal exports in 1898 was: Tin, £1,439l.; gold, £88,475l.; sugar, £67,418l.; blister copper, £378,565l.; jams, fruits &c., of the value of £183,345l.; timber and bark, £60,012l.; wool, £254,960l.; potatoes, £129,436l.

The land in crop on 1st Mar., 1899, was 258,542 acres and 238,799 acres permanently artificially sown grasses. There were in the colony 148,558 horned cattle, and 1,493,638 sheep. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1898 was 7,129,750 lb., valued at £54,360l.

Almost the whole of the trade is with Australia and the United Kingdom.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in minerals, which are now being turned to good account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, but have not yet been utilised. Rich deposits and lodes of tin are worked in various parts of the island, the principal workings being at Mount Bischoff, in the north-west, and Brankholm, in the north-east. The value of tin exported up to 31st December, 1898, was £6,679,302l. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. There exists in the island an enormous lode of bismuth, said to be the richest in the world. Copper and antimony have also been found, the most important centre being Mount Lyell, the copper mining 50 per cent. metal. The Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company have constructed a railway 15 miles in length to connect their works with a point on the King River, close to Strahan; during the year 1898 this company produced 4,992 tons of blister copper, of the value of £50,858l.

Great discoveries of silver have also been made in the neighbourhood of Mount Zeehan and Mount Dundas on the west coast, and a railway to connect the mines with the coast has been constructed and opened for traffic. Some assays of the ore have yielded as much as 1,800 ozs. to the ton, and there is no doubt that the fields when developed will prove among the richest in the world. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

Hobart and Launceston are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1898, 199 vessels, of 15,154 aggregate tonnage.

Population.

The population in 1891 was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females.
On 5th April, 1891, the population of Tasmania was 146,667, of whom 77,560 were males, and 69,107 females, being 5-4 persons to the square mile. The death-rate in 1890 was 13-51 to the 1,000 of the population. The number of inhabited houses not including tents (1,195) was 26,826. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds. Population, 31st December, 1898, was 177,340.

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing within the Registration boundary 39,800 inhabitants.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the colony, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 23,362.

Local Government.

Municipal councils were established in Hobart and Launceston in 1857, when responsible government was granted to the Colony, and under the Rural Municipalities Act of 1865 councils have been established in 21 districts. These councils consist of seven elected members, two retiring annually for two successive years and three every third year. The president of the council, called the Warden, is elected annually by the councillors. The voters for the election of councillors are every male or female over 21 years of age on the assessment roll. There are also 19 Town Boards established in the principal townships in the Police districts. In the districts where there are no municipalities the control of the roads is in the hands of Road Trusts. There are also 13 Water Trusts for the supply of water, and 30 Cemetery Trusts. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, Table Cape, Leven, and Strahan, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards. The total revenue of these various bodies, exclusive of Government Grants, in 1898 is estimated at £14,200l., and the expenditure £16,916l.

The outstanding local debt on 31st December, 1898, was £68,141l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are four banks established in the Colony, viz.: The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, with together, 38 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1898, amounted to £3,307,371l., deposits £1,068,143l.

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the colony, established by Government in connection with the Post Office Department, total deposits at time of last balancing, 31st December, 1898, being £785,126l.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1887 the Board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a director of education, working under the Minister of Lands as Ministerial head. The system is now made compulsory, but free only to children unable to pay fees, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 236 state schools in operation on 31st December, 1898, the number of scholars on the rolls 22,517, and the average attendance 12,015.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and higher course of education amongst the youth of the colony, the University of Tasmania was established in the year 1890, with power to grant scholarships. In all eight scholarships are now awarded annually.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17), constituting "the Parliament of Tasmania," supplemented by Act 49 Vic., No. 8.

The Legislative Council consists of 19 members, elected for 16 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council nor any person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible ministers) nor contractors to Government. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of £5l. or leasehold of 50l. per ann. value, or being a minister of religion, minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-eight members, elected for thirty electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court, a person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible ministers) nor a contractor to Government. The duration of the Assembly is three years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to have his name included in the assessment roll of the district for which his vote is to be given as the owner or occupier of any property, or to be in receipt of income of 40l. sterling per year, for 6 months prior to 1st November in any year. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vic., No. 32. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for four months. Members, excepting Ministers and certain officers of Parliament, are paid 100l.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

Defence.

The strength of the Colonial Volunteer Force is 2,279 officers and men. Batteries guard the mouths of the Derwent and Tamar rivers, and there are torpedo boats.
