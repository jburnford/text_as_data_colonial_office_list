TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and -10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 48 miles, and its average breadth 35 miles; and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony includes the island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 and 51 Vic., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of Oct., 1898, it was provided that, on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Gov. of Trinidad and Tobago the island of Tobago should be a ward of the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, that the revenue, expenditure and debt of Tobago should be charged in those of the united colony, and that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled. A proclamation was issued bringing these provisions into force from the 1st January, 1899.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the king of Spain until 1582, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalised his visit by burning the newly founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch and again in 1677 and 1689 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The conse-
The borough of Port of Spain was placed on the 1st January, 1899, under the management of four Commissioners, styled "The Port of Spain Four Commissioners," constituted under an Ordinance passed on the 20th of December, 1898 (No. 4 of 1899). The Commissioners are Mr. N. W. Knaggs (Chief Commissioner), Hon. V. Brown, Q.C., and Messrs. G. Goodville and Léon Agostini.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1891, 6,570), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1891, 3,653). The total municipal revenue of the three boroughs in 1898 was £26,588L, the expenditure £25,695L, and the debt, Board of San Fernando excepted, was £38,003L on 31st December, 1898.

A pitch lake, 104 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Commissioners, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of £10,000, and a royalty on the quantity mined of 30,000 tons. The lease is for 21 years from 1st January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of £4,000L a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from the Pitch Lake in 1898 was £34,056L.

Of the total area of Trinidad, which is estimated at about 1,120,000 acres, the allocated acreage at the end of 1898 was estimated to be approximately 450,926 acres. About 205,000 acres are under cultivation; 669,674 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers, which ply three times a week, and by the railway. The Gulf steamers proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Courland line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880.

An extension of 41 miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles), on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Prince's Town in 1882, and further extensions to Savana Grande (12 miles) and Tabacalito (14 miles) were opened to traffic on 29th August, 1897, and 13th August, 1898, respectively. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande. The total length of line open is about 80½ miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total receipts from the railway and tramways and telegraphs during 1898 were £71,166L, and the expenditure was £70,349L. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund, which in 1898 amounted to £106,423L.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and about 57 out-offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with...
British Guiana, Grenada, and Saint Croix, and thence via the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 166 miles, constructed by the Government. The receipts in 1898 were £372, and the expenses £2,884.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 34 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides some few transient steamers:—Harrison Line, West Indian and Pacific, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Dutch Line, London Direct Line, Oriental, Canadian, Quebec and Gulf Line, Oriental and Culebra, Orinoco Line, New York and Bermudian, Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co., and the Royal Mail Line. It is worthy of note that the steamers of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique are as a rule of greater tonnage than the ocean boats of the Royal Mail, and find no difficulty in entering the port. The communication with the neighbouring Republic of Venezuela averages for the year over 16 steamers per month.

A fortnightly service to New York has been started by a local firm. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers. The rates of postage are as follows per ½-oz. letter:—

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £48,809 was expended by the Government in 1898, in introducing 1,292 (Statute adults) immigrants. The numbers introduced in 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897 and 1898 respectively were 1,910, 2,519, 2,193, 3,087, 1,869 and 1,292.

The amount remitted to India during 1898 by return Indian immigrants was £10,797 15 10

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, United States gold currency, and gold doubloons. These are all legal tender, as is also British gold, which is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of £100,000 estimated.

There is no Colonial coinage or note issue.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank has a branch at Port of Spain. Government savings banks are established in nine districts. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1898 was £24,288. They are under the management of the Receiver-General and the local wardens.

Defence.

A volunteer rifle corps was established in Port of Spain in 1879, and detached companies at San Fernando, Arima, Princes Town, Couva, and Tunapuna. A yeomanry corps has also been established with troops in large centres, and a volunteer artillery corps at Port of Spain. Total strength 767.

The police force consists of 553 officers and men.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, St. Mary's College. Attached to these institutions are four exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of £50 each, tenable for three years at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of 1898—91 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and 208 on those of St. Mary's College.

The primary schools are now 204 in number, 57 of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and 147 denominational and assisted. Fees are exacted, the rate being two-pence per head per week, and in the Model Schools and two assisted schools five shillings per month. In connection with the Model Schools there are Training Colleges for male and female teachers, which admit twelve resident and seven non-resident students. The Government schools in 1898 had 9,810 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 18,056.

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for girls. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad is shown to be 24,866.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who settled at New Waddell. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole Island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a Company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.
In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Boullie, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British Force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuthbertson and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

By Order in Council under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 26th of October, 1898, Tobago became a Ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from the 1st January, 1899.

Situation and Area.

It is the most southerly of the Windward group of the British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9' W. long. 60° 12', distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1863, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction, and the width at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,813 acres, of which about 10,000 acres are under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

General Description.

Sugar, rum, molasses, cocoanuts, and live stock form the principal articles of export. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,400 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England. The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the southeastern base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population in 1891 of 919. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacolet Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

Education. On the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who maintain 25 schools with about 2,874 scholars, assisted by a Government grant of £1,000.
