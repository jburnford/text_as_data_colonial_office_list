RHODESIA.

Rhodesia is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company, and is divided by the river Zambesi into Northern and Southern Rhodesia. Northern Rhodesia consists of the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo Free State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the British Central Africa Protectorate, which is under direct Imperial Administration. Southern Rhodesia is formed by the two provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland.

On the 29th October, 1889, the Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions. The principal field of the operations of the Company is defined to be the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese territories.

Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lo Bengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Macloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was reached on 12th Sept., 1890. The pioneers were then disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims.

In July 1893 the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives living under the Company's protection, near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's Police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland, to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's Police and a large force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the north and east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 3,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's force near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland Police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lo Bengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.
This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Shangani, and Major Wilson with a small party were after a heroic resistance killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lo Bengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambezi, is reported to have died from smallpox or fever.

At the end of 1895 occurred Dr. Jameson's raid into the Transvaal (see also under Bechuanaland Protectorate), which resulted in measures being taken to give the High Commissioner increased control over the Company's administration, especially the police. These were subsequently embodied in the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council 1898.

In 1896, owing to a variety of causes, the Matabele broke out in rebellion, and shortly after the Mashonas followed suit. Imperial troops had to be sent to the assistance of the Company's police and volunteers, and it was only after a prolonged struggle that peace was secured.

The capital of Mashonaland, and the seat of government, is Salisbury; the principal town of Matabeleland, and the chief commercial centre of Rhodesia, is Bulawayo. Both Salisbury and Bulawayo have recently been constituted municipalities. The white population of Salisbury is 2,000; and that of Bulawayo 7,500. The elevation of these towns is between four and five thousand feet above sea level, and the climate is healthy.

The Standard Bank of South Africa has established branches at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, and Gwelo; the Bank of Africa at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali and Beira; and the African Banking Corporation at Salisbury and Bulawayo.

There are hospitals at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Victoria, Umtali, and Gwelo which have been thoroughly equipped, and are maintained at a high state of efficiency. Considerable additions have been made to the hospital buildings at Salisbury and Bulawayo; and at Umtali and Gwelo new and extensive buildings have been erected. In the outlying districts of Hartley, Abercorn, Selukwe, Sebakwe, Gwanda, and Belingwe new hospitals have been established and equipped.

There are several clubs at Salisbury and Bulawayo, and daily and weekly papers are published in both towns.

Public roads in Rhodesia have been made to the extent of 2,485 miles, and telegraph lines to the extent of 2,635 miles of line, and 3,613 miles of wire.

The African Transcontinental Telegraph Company has constructed a telegraph line from Umtali, in Mashonaland, to Abercorn, at the south end of Lake Tanganyika, a distance of 1,027 miles. A branch line, 123 miles long, from Domira Bay, Lake Nyasa, to Fort Jameson, in M'poseni's country, is under construction. Chirimo is connected by a branch line from Chikwawa, by means of which communication is possible with Chinde. Blantyre is the transmitting office for all traffic from Europe and South Africa. Telegraphic communication between Blantyre and Umtali was established on the 20th April, 1898. The Imperial German Government has recently agreed to the extension of the telegraph line from Abercorn northwards through German territory to British East Africa.

The Bechuanaland Railway reached Bulawayo on the 19th of October, 1897, and was formally opened on the 4th of November. An extension of the Beira Railway from Umtali reached Salisbury on the 1st May, 1899, and was formally opened on the 22nd May. This places Salisbury in direct communication with the sea over a line 382 miles in length. The extension of the Bechuanaland Railway (now styled The Rhodesia Railways Limited), from Bulawayo to Lake Tanganyika, is under construction. The first section of 150 miles to Gwelo is expected to be completed early in the year 1900. A branch line from Bulawayo to Gwanda, to open up the gold and coal districts to the south-east of Bulawayo, is under construction.

The mail services throughout Rhodesia have been greatly improved. Regular communication between Salisbury and Bulawayo and the outlying districts, and a monthly service with Barotseland, have been established. The time taken by mails to reach England has now been reduced to three weeks from Bulawayo, and four from Salisbury.

Telegraphic communication continues to be rapidly established. On the 30th September, 1898, 62 telegraph offices were open.

A sale of stands in Salisbury, New Umtali, Melsetter, and the new township of Enkeldoorn was held at Salisbury on the 14th, 15th and 16th September, 1897. The following prices were obtained:

| Location       | Number of Stands | Price (£) |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Salisbury      | 75               | 21,470   |
| New Umtali     | 77               | 25,715   |
| Melsetter      | 80               | 3,860    |
| Enkeldoorn     | 100              | 8,705    |
| **Total**      |                  | **£59,750** |

A sale of town and suburban stands in Bulawayo and Gwelo was held at Bulawayo on the 8th and 9th November, 1897, with the following results:

| Location       | Number of Stands | Price (£) |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Bulawayo       | 95 town          | 32,815   |
|                | 11 suburban      | 4,400    |
| Gwelo          | 26 town          | 6,140    |
| **Total**      |                  | **£43,355** |

The rinderpest, which for several years devastated Africa, travelling slowly through the continent from north to south, made its first appearance in Matabeleland in February, 1896. The adoption of the drastic regulations which the Administration decided to enforce had to some extent checked the progress of the epidemic, when the outbreak of the rebellion put a stop to all precautionary measures. The effects of the disease were far-reaching, and, apart from considerations of human life, were more disastrous than those of the native rebellion. In March, 1898, a system of compulsory inoculation for rinderpest was established in Matabeleland, and the precautions taken have proved very effective. No case has been recorded for several months, and there is reason to hope that the disease has been finally stamped out.

Since the pacification of the country, considerable tracts of land have been placed under cultivation, and fresh stock is being imported. Good prices are obtained, both for stock and produce. Throughout the country the conditions of soil and climate are suitable for all kinds of European cereals and vegetables, and, in addition, many trees, shrubs and plants peculiar to sub-tropical regions can be successfully cultivated. Good results have already been obtained from the introduction of fruit and other trees. Tobacco
occurs in a wild state, is grown universally by the natives, and has been produced of excellent quality by white farmers in several districts. The results so far obtained point to the rapid expansion of this industry. Indiarubber, indigo, and cotton are similarly indigenous, and will probably well repay cultivation. In the neighbourhood of the towns there are a large number of market gardens under cultivation; and vegetables of excellent quality are produced. Large fruit orchards are in course of formation, and all fruit trees thrive. Grapes, figs, oranges, peaches, almonds, walnuts, lemons, bananas, pomegranates, apples, apricots, and damson plums of good quality are cultivated.

The sale of dairy produce is a profitable industry in the neighbourhood of the towns, and butter and milk of excellent quality can be obtained.

Farm stock in Rhodesia includes cattle, sheep, goats, poultry, horses, and pigs. The latter are largely bred and are always profitable and successful. It is believed that Angora goats and Merino sheep will thrive.

The Rhodesian forests produce abundance of hard timber of fine quality, and a company is working this industry with a view to meeting the large demand for building and other purposes in Salisbury and Bulawayo.

In addition to gold, silver, copper, coal, tin, plumbago, antimony, arsenic and kieselguhr have been discovered. The arrival of the railway at Bulawayo gave an impetus to the mining industry. The total output of gold from all sources to the end of October, 1898, was 12,757 ounces; the output for the twelve months ending 31st October, 1899, was 67,169 ounces. Complete milling plants have been ordered for other mines now approaching the producing stage, and there is every reason to hope that the output for the ensuing twelve months will be considerably larger than that of the present year.

North of the Zambesi the country has as yet been little prospected. Coal has been found on the shore of Lake Nyasa. The North Charterland Exploration Company, which holds a grant of 10,000 square miles north of the Zambesi, is engaged in trading, agricultural, and stock-breeding operations. On the hills, which range from 2,000 to 5,000 feet, it is hoped to grow coffee with success. There is a considerable trade in rubber. The oil palm is now thoroughly established in Northern Rhodesia, and it is hoped that in a few years' time an important article of native trade will have been added to the resources of the country. Northern Rhodesia is remarkably well adapted for cattle. The company is introducing the Angora goat, and the introduction of certain breeds of sheep is contemplated. In the uplands of Northern Rhodesia cereals and European fruit trees grow well. A new industry has lately been started in fibre, on which the representative of a large London company has been experimenting with satisfactory results. The rope made from the fibre is reported to be infinitely superior to the best Manila; and as the fibre plant grows very generally all over the country, a great future is anticipated for this trade. In Southern Rhodesia the company is being formed to develop the indiarubber industry on a large scale.

Provision was made by the Matabeleland Order in Council, 1894, for an appeal in civil matters from the High Court to the Supreme Court of the Cape Colony, subject to the assent of the Legislature of the Colony being obtained. This right of appeal is limited to cases in which the amount of value in dispute exceeds one hundred pounds sterling. During the session of 1896 the necessary assent was given by the Cape Parliament by Sections 44 to 49 of the Act for the Better Administration of Justice, which were put into force in Rhodesia from the 1st November, 1896, by proclamation of the High Commissioner. As a further result of these enactments, an appeal now lies to the Privy Council from the Supreme Court upon the same conditions as in the Cape Colony.

Full advantage was taken of the facilities afforded to the Administrator in Council by the Matabeleland Order in Council, 1894, to legislate locally, by means of regulations and upwards of forty useful measures were thus passed. Several Ordinances also became law. An Order in Council, entitled the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898, has been passed repealing the Matabeleland Order in Council, 1894, and in some measure providing for a new constitution in Southern Rhodesia, one element of which is the creation of a Legislative Council, composed of the Senior Administrator (President), the Resident Commissioner (ex officio), the Administrator of Matabeleland, 5 nominated and 4 elected members. The Senior Administrator is advised by an Executive Committee consisting of 7 members. This Order in Council gives large powers of control to the High Commissioner (see under South Africa). A Customs Clause in the new Order provides that the duty on British goods imported into Southern Rhodesia shall not exceed the present Cape tariff. By a proclamation, dated the 10th day of June, 1891, the laws of the Cape Colony passed prior to that date were adopted for and are to be administered in Rhodesia, as far as the circumstances of the country will permit. This enactment is made subject to certain specific provisions contained in the Proclamation which deal with the jurisdiction and procedure of the Courts, and the powers of resident commissioners and magistrates, and with the jurisdiction to be exercised, under certain circumstances, by native chiefs. The laws of the Cape Colony passed subsequently to the above-mentioned date are not to apply to Rhodesia.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1899, a resolution was passed agreeing to accept the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government to be made in the original charter of the Company by the Secretary of State. A further resolution was passed approving certain alterations in the original Deed of Settlement of the Company. These resolutions were confirmed at a further Extraordinary General Meeting, held on the 10th January, 1900.

Full details as to the administration of Rhodesia, and as to climate and products, with routes to and from Rhodesia, can be obtained from the recently issued reports to be had on application at the offices of the British South Africa Company, 15, St. Swithin's Lane, London, E.C.
