THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south:

* Exclusive of produce of other small islands received at Rarotonga for distribution.
St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago was united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Victoria, cap. 44, 1869-70, 1883, and 1890 being made a Ward of that Island. The remaining three British Colonies are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and its population about £54,598.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal union may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

Consitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. A common audit system was instituted in 1889.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, doubleons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is a Governor's note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

Communications.

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 13 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Barbados for the purpose of transshipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call at least once a month, and there is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York, Grenada being the first and last port of call.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telegraph system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cable to St. Thomas and St. Croix. The rate per word for telegrams to Europe from Grenada is 4s. 11½d. (Government messages, 3s. 5½d.)
