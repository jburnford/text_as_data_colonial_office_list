VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 146th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of the stream, to Port Phillip, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass's Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and the whole of the eastern Australian White's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the colony meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 31' S., longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is Cape Ripon, near the western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles; or 56,245,700 acres (not equivalent to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,644,628 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west, by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Great Western District, that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely
wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them. The range has been traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places. That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other colonies of the group, that it now contains 33 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The estimated population on the 1st December, 1898, was 1,175,463, viz.: 593,423 males and 582,040 females. These numbers give a proportion of 98 females to 100 males, or 102 males to 100 females.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 577 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India, and Messageries Maritimes and French Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number about 1,831. The postal and telegraph revenue is not accurately known, but was estimated to have been £51,367, in 1897–8, and the expenditure was £49,192.

Victoria, with the other Australasian colonies, having joined the Universal Postal Union from 1st October, 1891, the rates of postage are now uniform for all countries outside Australasia.

There are 3,130 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1898, was £38,593,205. The revenue for 1897–8 was £2,608,896, and the expenditure £1,646,054.

There are 6,599 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 14,729 miles of wire, also about 11,232 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1898 was 1,806,184, of which about 79,000 or Government business were transmitted free.

There are 13 telephone exchanges in the colony, with 3,630 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1898 was £155,957.

Stage coaches run to all parts of the Colony where railway communication is not available.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57.7°; the mean atmospheric pressure at 91.3 feet above the sea level was 29.94 inches; rain falls on the average upon 130 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 24 inches.

History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England, he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonization, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, surgeon in the Royal Navy, sailed in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year, an attempt was made to colonize the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. The two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port
Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same place, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were under Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the as yet unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of theertility, its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements, but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales, gradually occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Hovell, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr Charles La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers, in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is grazing and agriculture, 3,877,922 acres being under cultivation in 1898-99. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 2,154,153 acres, producing 19,681,304 bushels; oats, 266,159 acres, producing 5,523,419 bushels; barley, 47,859 acres, producing 1,112,567 bushels; potatoes, 41,252 acres, producing 147,300 tons; and hay, 565,345 acres, producing 729,299 tons. About 27,700 acres are devoted to the culture of the vine, producing annually about 20,000 gallons of wine, and 13,225 ewts. of brandy. A small area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees, and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. The dairying industry has made rapid strides in the last few years; in 1897-8 there were about 400,000 milch cows, from which were produced 54,000,000 lbs. of butter, of which 19,000,000 lbs. were exported, and 4,600,000 lbs. of cheese.

On the 31st March, 1895, it is estimated that there were in the colony 431,547 horses, 1,833,900 cattle, 13,180,943 sheep, and 337,558 pigs. The wool exported in 1898 amounted to 131,890,569 lbs., valued at 4,036,968L. The amount of gold raised in 1898 was 837,257 oz., making a total since 1851 of 62,684,706 oz., valued at 250,738,820L. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with great success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the Colony will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of black coal raised in 1898 was 242,860 tons. The chief exports other than wool and gold (which comprise more than three-fifths of the total), are grain and flour, cattle hides, and skins, meats, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, coal, tea, and iron. About two-fifths of the trade is with the United Kingdom, and one-fifth with the United Australian Colonies, only about one-fifth being with other British possessions and foreign countries. The latter consist principally of the following:—Germany, France, United States, India, Belgium, Hong Kong, Ceylon, Cape Colony, Norway, Mauritius, Straits Settlements, Japan, Java, and China, in the order named. Melbourne does not form part of the trade, other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Wodonga, Walgett, Yarrawonga, Tocumwal, Cobram, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1898 numbered 399 with a total tonnage of 101,682.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a prominent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments employing four hands or upwards, except when machinery worked by steam or other power is employed, and except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special attention. No returns are required from shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on therein; were this done, the manufactories of the Colony might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. According to the latest returns, there are in the Colony 75 flour mills, which during the year operated upon 7,947,381 bundles of wheat, and 1202,821 lbs. of oats; or otherwise 15,361,266 gallons of beer were brewed; 94 brick yards, some being also potteries, which made 64,511,000 bricks, pipes and tiles valued at 36,315L, and pottery valued at 25,746L; 102 tanneries, fellmongeries, and wool-washing establishments, which tanned 1,451,490 hides and skins, shipped 1,455,674 sheaf skins, and washed 7,245,081 lbs. of wool; 8 washeries, which shipped 2,683,803 lbs. of wool, and produced 2,019,981 yards of tweed, cloth, and flannel, 29,872 pairs of blankets, and 2,375 shawls; 22 soap and candle works, which made 128,000 cwt.s of soap, and 41,907 cwt.s of candles; 14 tobacco manufactories, which manufactured 1,066,008 lbs. of tobacco, 8,763,751 cigars, 84,497,770 cigarettes, and 1,360,186 lbs. of snuff, 10 million tins, which made 445,626 gallons of spirits; 195 butter and cheese factories, which made 26,886,860 lbs. of butter, 2,283,170 lbs. of cheese; 164,817 gallons of concentrated milk; and sold 471,924 lbs. of cream; 23 bacon and ham curing establishments, which cured 7,153,740 lbs. of bacon and
ham; 208 establishments working in books or stationery; 3 in musical instruments; 14 in carving and figures; 7 in designs, medals, and dies; 3 in philosophical instruments; 2 in surgical instruments; 4 in arms and ammunition; 293 in machines, tools, and implements; 221 in carriages and harness; 9 in ships and boats; 38 in houses, buildings, &c.; 112 in furniture; 31 in chemicals; 508 in dress; 15 in fibrous materials; 9 in animal food; 53 in vegetable food; 169 in drinks and stimulants; 1 in animal medicines; 370 in vegetable matters; 61 in coal, gas, and electric lights; 11 works; 9 railway workshops; 37 in gold, silver, and precious stones; 7 in glass; 1 in asbestos; and 38 in metals other than gold and silver. The total number of all establishments is 2,869, of which 1,778 use steam or gas-engines, the total horse power of which is 39,956. They employ 54,778 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is £1,877,285.

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other colonies. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. The more important works connected with the principal rivers to provide for the supply for local schemes, are undertaken by and under the direct control of the state. These are known as "National Works," the total expenditure which by 30th June, 1898, amounted to £839,849. Local schemes are carried out by "Irrigation and Water Supply Trusts," constituted by the Governor in Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Loans are advanced by the Government, and the Commissioners are empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation within the area under their jurisdiction, in order to provide the annual interest on the loan and the necessary payment to the sinking fund; also to defray the current expenses attendant upon the operations of the trust. On 30th June, 1898, there were 29 of these trusts, having jurisdiction over 2,740,000 acres of land, of which about two-thirds is capable of being irrigated, and with power to borrow £1,511,517, of which £1,033,283 has already been obtained.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, is the most populous city in Australasia, having, with its suburbs, at the end of 1898 a population of 469,880. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (44,818), Bendigo (42,992), Geelong (23,334), Warrnambool, (6,960), Castlemaine (7,932), and Stawell (3,500).

Chinese.

By the Chinese Immigration Restriction Act, 1888, the immigration of Chinese is limited to one Chinese to every 500 tons known of any vessel arriving. There are not more than 9,000 in the Colony.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering about 420 in all, throughout the Colony during the last quarter of 1898—The Bank of Australasia, of New South Wales, of New Zealand, of Victoria, Colonial of Australasia, Commercial of Australia, English, Scottish and Australian, London of Australia, National of Australasia, Royal of Australia, and the Union of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to £28,027,138L, and the value of the notes in circulation was £904,930L.

There are also more than 400 branches of the Savings Bank throughout the Colony. The number of accounts open on the 30th June, 1898, was 338,260, and the amount on deposit was £8,099,364L. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of over £5,000,000 is coined annually.

Education.

Educational establishments in Victoria are of four classes viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education; private schools for both primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognized in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1897 was 686. From the date of the opening of the university to the end of 1897, the total number of students who matriculated was 1,197, and 2,215 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, embrace 5 Schools of Art, 10 Schools of Mines, 3 Working Men's Colleges, 1 Agricultural College, 1 Horticultural College, and 1 Viticultural College. The principal of those is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes, open to women as well as men; the average number of enrolments of individual students in 1897 was 1,156.

The system of primary public instruction which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 13, and state instruction is granted free of cost. In 1898 there were 1,877 State schools, with a total enrolment of 238,357 scholars, instructed by 4,568 teachers. The average attendance was 134,976. In 1897 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was £585,639. There is no local control over the schools, and the teachers are paid by a fixed salary only, payment by results having been abolished.

The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government.
According to the returns for 1897-98, there were 929 private schools in Victoria, with 2,390 teachers, and an attendance of 42,899 scholars. Of these schools, the Roman Catholic denomination had 226, with 827 teachers and 24,066 scholars.

**Australasian Federal Council.**

Victoria has taken a leading part in promoting the Federation of the Australasian Colonies, and was mainly instrumental in procuring the passing of the "Federal Council Act of Australasia" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act created a Council of two members from each Colony, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which had only one member each, with power to Her Majesty at the request of the Legislatures of the Colonies to increase the number of representatives for each Colony by Order in Council. Such an increase was made at the request of the Legislatures moved by Her Majesty in April, May, 1890. An Order in Council was passed, providing that each Colony which is or shall be represented on the Federal Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members each. This Council has power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits, securing the enforcement of retrospective civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they have been passed, the extradition of offenders, and the custody of offenders on ships belonging to Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two or more Colonies may also refer to it for legislation questions of commerce, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and joint stock companies, and other matters of general Australasian interest; but legislation of the Council on such matters is to extend only to the Colonies by whose Legislatures the matters shall have been so referred, and such Colonies as may afterwards adopt the same. It has also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent. The Council is to meet at least once in every two years.

The first meeting took place on 25th January, 1886, when representatives were present from Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed extending the operation of warrants and judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented. Various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits. The second session opened on 14th January, 1888. An address was adopted to Her Majesty respecting the deportation of French criminals to the Pacific. An Act was also passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Beche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Queensland. The Council met for its third session on 29th January, 1889, when Representatives from South Australia were present for the first time. The amendment of the basis of representation in the Council was discussed at the session, and communications on the subject have since passed with the Imperial Government. The fourth session opened 29th January, and closed 24th January, 1891. South Australia was not represented; the Act (a temporary measure for two years only) under which that province joined the Federation having expired. The only Bill passed was one to facilitate the recognition in other colonies of Orders and Declarations of the Supreme Court of any colony in matters of lunacy. An address to Her Majesty was also adopted referring to the desirability of British subjects being placed on an equal footing with subjects of other countries in regard to the acquisition of land in, and trading with, natives of the New Hebrides.

The fifth session was commenced on 26th January, 1893, when the colonies of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia were represented. An Act was passed providing for the discipline and government of the garrisons established at King George's Sound and Thursday Island, and an address was adopted in favour of an increase in the number of representatives for each Colony, except any Crown Colony, to five. The Standing Committee was instructed to take steps for giving effect to this resolution, and also for securing the adhesion of the Colonies not represented in the Council. As the result of action taken by the Standing Committee, the Legislatures of all the Colonies in the Federation asked Her Majesty, requesting that no proposal be made to increase the number of representatives might be made; and, on 3rd March, 1894, Her Majesty was pleased to make an Order in Council providing "That each Colony which is or shall be represented in the said Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members each."

The sixth session opened on the 30th January, 1895, when the same four colonies were represented as at the preceding session. There were present, for the first time, five delegates from each colony. In view of this, two Bills were brought forward, but resolutions were adopted affirming the desirability of defining the status, and of granting facilities for the winding up of Companies carrying on business in different colonies; of rendering uniform the laws relating to banking; of establishing an effectual system of quarantine; of adopting a more economic method of raising public loans; and of taking steps with a view to the holding of a second Federation Convention. An address to the Queen was also adopted praying for the appointment of an Australasian representative on the Privy Council Bench, in view of the special features often presented by Australasian appeals.

The seventh Session was commenced on 26th January, 1897, when the Colonies of Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia, were represented. An Act was passed, with a reference of the matter to the Council by the Legislatures of Victoria and Queensland, to provide for the naturalisation within the Australian Colonies, or some of them, of persons of European descent naturalised in any of such Colonies, also upon a reference of the subject by the Legislatures of Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, an Act was passed to make provision for the enforcement in certain cases within the Australasian Colonies, or some of them, of Orders of the Supreme Court of such Colonies for the production of testaments and instruments. The Council adopted an Address to Her Majesty, referring to the Address adopted in 1891 with regard to restrictions in the way of trade with the natives of the New Hebrides which fell exclusively on British subjects, now again urging that negotiations may be entered into
with the other powers concerned with a view to imposing on their subjects equal restrictions in that trade. This and all the previous sessions were held at Hobart. The Council resolved that the place of its next meeting should be Melbourne.

Australasian Federation.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Federal Council, however, a movement has been made for the establishment of a more perfect Federation, to embrace a Federal Executive, as well as Legislature, somewhat upon the model of Canada. Towards the end of 1889 negotiations were opened between the various Australasian Colonies, the result being that a Conference of the seven principal Australasian Colonies was held in Melbourne, on 6th February, 1890. At this Conference it was unanimously agreed that the best scheme of the Australasian Colonies would be promoted by their "early union under the Crown," and that the Legislatures of the various Colonies should be invited to appoint delegates to a National Australasian Convention during the year 1891 delegates empowered to report upon scheme for a Federal Constitution.

In accordance with these resolutions, delegates were appointed, and the Convention commenced its deliberations in Sydney on the 2nd March, 1891. After an animated debate, which lasted more than a fortnight, a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia" was drawn up and adopted. This Bill the Convention recommended should be submitted for the approval of the people and Parliaments of the several colonies. It provided for the union of the Australasian Colonies in a Federal Commonwealth under the Crown, for a Governor-General to be appointed by the Crown, who should be aided and advised by an Executive Council, the constitution of a Senate and House of Representatives, with certain definite powers, the latter to have the initiation of money bills, which the former might pass or reject, but not amend, and for the establishment of a Federal Judicature; the revenue of the Commonwealth to be derived from the Customs and Excise duties, which should be collected by Federal officers, and expended as required for Federal purposes, any surplus to be returned to the respective colonies. It also provided for absolute free trade internally throughout the Commonwealth, so soon as the Parliament should have imposed uniform Customs duties.

A meeting of the Premiers of all the Australasian Colonies took place in Hobart in January, 1893, and agreed to a scheme for a complete Federation to be submitted for the approval of their respective Parliaments. The enabling Bill, adopted at this Conference providing for the election by each Colony of 10 delegates to prepare a scheme of Federation, was adopted by the Parliaments of N. S. Wales, Victoria, S. Australia, and Tasmania, and in a modified form by Western Australia.

Delegates were accordingly duly elected and assembled in Convention at Adelaide on 22nd March, 1897, for the purpose of drafting a constitution. Having prepared a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia," the Convention was on the 23rd April adjourned to reassemble at Sydney on 2nd September. The draft Bill was in the meantime submitted to the local legislatures, and various amendments, &c., were suggested by those bodies. The Bill, together with those amendments, was further considered by the delegates at the Sydney Session of the Convention, but the work of revision was not completed, and the Convention adjourned until 20th January, 1898, at Melbourne. The Convention met on that date accordingly, and remained in session until 17th March, when a Bill was adopted, which, in pursuance of the provisions of the "Australasian Federation Enabling Act, 1893," was submitted on 3rd June for acceptance or rejection by the people of Victoria. The result of the polling was as follows: For the acceptance of the Constitution set forth in the Bill, 100,520; for its rejection, 22,099. The Bill was also accepted by the vote of the people in South Australia and Tasmania; but in New South Wales, the statutory majority required was not obtained, and hence the further progress towards federation was checked for the time being. Subsequently, at a Conference of the Premiers of all the Australasian Colonies except New Zealand, held in Melbourne in January, 1899, a compromise was arrived at as to certain financial amendments desired by New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, and the Bill, as so amended, was submitted for approval to the electors of all the Colonies represented except Western Australia (for the first time in Queensland, and for the second time in the other Colonies), and was carried in each of the five Colonies by a substantial majority, the voting in Victoria being 152,653 for, and 9,805 against, and in New South Wales 107,420 for, and 82,741 against the Bill. The five assenting Colonies have now sent addresses to the Queen praying that the Commonwealth of Australia be established by an enactment of the Imperial Parliament.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Ministry. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 48 members elected for fourteen Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 95 members returned by 84 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

One of the Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years, so that the tenure of seats is six years; and there is a further special election once every six years for an extra Member for each of the Provinces. Council has no power to dissolve the Council. The property qualification of Members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of £100. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than £10 per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a £5 annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage virtually exists so far as the election of that body
is concerned. Plural voting was abolished by an Act passed in August, 1899, so far as the election of members of the Assembly is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is under ordinary circumstances three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856.

All Members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid £300 a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The Members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,342 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the Colony. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the Members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality except that used for public purposes; for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1897-8 there were 58 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 150 shires. The number of ratepayers was about 310,900; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 10,152,500£; representing a value in fee simple of 168,612,000£; the total income in 1897-8 (including 104,825£ received from Government) was 1,130,501£, and the expenditure was 1,183,637£; whilst their indebtedness (exclusive of amounts borrowed from the general Government) amounted to 3,551,914£.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1898 was 132,948£, and its expenditure 137,909£. The debt of the Trust at the end of 1898 amounted to 2,000,000£.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1897-98 the Board's ordinary revenue was 168,553£, and its expenditure 281,421£, exclusive of 439,969£ from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1898, amounting to 6,252,737£, of which, however, 2,559,157£ was raised in the first instance by the general Government, and is included in the Public Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works in course of construction amounted to 2,251,609£, up to the 30th June, 1898.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities, and the Insurance Companies. In 1898 their revenue amounted to 47,450£, their ordinary expenditure to 44,265£, and their debt to 130,000£.

The Melbourne Tramways Trust is a Municipal Corporation, created for the purpose of constructing tramways in Melbourne and suburbs, which it has done at a cost of 1,705,794£, provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. This debt will be gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a Public Company, to whom the lines have been let for a period of 30 years. On the 2nd July, 1898, the sinking fund amounted to 420,411£.

Defences.

The land forces, chiefly militia, at the end of 1898 comprised an establishment of 5,867 men of all arms, of whom 381 were permanent and 3,385 formed the militia, the remainder being volunteers.

The fleet, which has an establishment of 300 men, comprises the armoured turret-ship "Cerberus," and two first-class and three second-class torpedo boats.
