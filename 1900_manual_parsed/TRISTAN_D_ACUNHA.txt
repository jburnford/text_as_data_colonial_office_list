TRISTAN D'ACUNHA.

Tristan d'Acunha and Gough Island are the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6' S. and long. 12° 2' W. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. Upon his death the garrison was withdrawn, with the exception of three men, who, with certain shipwrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement. For a long time only one of the settlers had a wife, but subsequently the others contracted with a sea captain to bring wives from St. Helena. The population, when the island was visited in November, 1897, by one of H.M. ships, was found to be only 64. It contains practically no stations, as the stronger and more ambitious settlers migrate in batches to the Cape. The inhabitants practically enjoy their possessions in common, and there is no strong drink on the island, and no crime. It was at one time proposed to give them laws and a regular government, but this was found unnecessary for the above reasons, and they remain under the moral rule of their oldest inhabitant, Governor Green, successor to Governor Glass, Corporal in the Royal Artillery, and founder of the settlement. The inhabitants are spoken of as long-lived, healthy, moral, religious, and hospitable to strangers. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a steamer in April, 1886. Sadly, two able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885. There are between 800 and 900 head of cattle, 500 sheep, and a great many geese on the islands, and crops of potatoes are raised.
