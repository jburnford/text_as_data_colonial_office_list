WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 120th degree of longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

Physical Features.

The coast line, extending for a distance of about 5,200 miles, is indented by a certain number of bays, creeks, and harbours, and in the northern parts fringed by numerous islands. In the south there are three separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The loftiest range in the Southern District is the Stirling Range, the highest point of which is about 3,500 feet. The other principal ranges known as the Blackwood, Darling, and Roe, although not so extensive as Mount William, in the Murray District, 3,000 feet high, do not reach greater altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea. In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the Leopold and the Mueller ranges, the highest point in the latter attaining about 2,300 feet. The settled districts are usually level or undulating, rarely mountainous. The western seaboard is consequently mostly of a sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation. To the eastward of the Darling range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character, and improves for some distance inland. The north and north-eastern parts of the Colony contain a large area of good pastoral country, suitable also in some parts for the growth of tropical products, such as sugar and coffee.

The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the north to Point d'Entrecasteaux in the south, a distance of about 300 miles.

Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this range, and flow into the sea to the westward.

The principal rivers of the Colony are the Ord, Prince Regent, Panton, Fitzroy, De Grey, Harding, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoyne, Marsh, Greenough, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Collie, Preston, Blackwood, Warren, Pallinup, and Gordon. Most of these are mere storm-water channels filled only during the rainy season, and very few of them are navigable for any distance even for small boats.

Lakes and Islands.

The lake district may be considered to be confined to the westward of the Darling range; within this area there are numerous salt and fresh water lakes and lagoons—but many of them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.

Numerous islands and islets occur along the coast-line. Dirk Hartog Island, in Sharks Bay, is the largest, and those used for pastoral purposes whilst groano is found on the mainland comprised in Houtman's Abrillicus, the Lacepedes, and various other islands on the north-west coast.

History.

In 1825 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1827 Captain James Stirling, in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and in 1829 Captain Fremanntle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. "Challenger," took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle (the latter named after Captain Fremantle mentioned above), and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agriculture and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1850, the Colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned that it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the settlement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution was what is called "Representative," established by Act 33 Victoria, No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 11 electors.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The legislature consists of two houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 24 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 44 members. Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The Colony is divided into 8 electoral divisions, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—3 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the Colony for at least 2 years; (3) a natural born subject of Her Majesty or naturalized

Qualification of Elector.—Each elector must (1) be at least 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity; (2) be a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, resident in the Colony for 12 months, or a denizen of Western Australia; (3) within the electoral province for which he seeks to be registered: (a) have possessed for at least 1 year before being registered, a freehold estate in the clear value of 10l., above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same; or (b) have been a householder for the last preceding 12 months, the dwelling house being of the clear annual value of 25l.; or (c) be holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 25l., the lease having 18 months to run; or (d) have been holder of a leasehold, for the last preceding 18 months, of the annual value of 25l.; or (e) be holder of a lease or license from the Crown at an annual rental of at least 10l.; or (f) have his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Board in respect of property in the province of the annual rateable value of 25l.

Legislative Assembly.—There are 44 electorates for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by a single member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 4 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the Colony for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the Queen, or shall have been naturalized for 5 years, and shall have resided in the Colony for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Any man of the age of 21 years being a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and not subject to any legal incapacity, who shall have resided in the colony for at least 12 months, if he (1) has been resident in the district at the time of making his claim for 6 months; or (2) has held a freehold estate in the district of the clear value of 50l., above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same for 6 months next before the time of making the claim; or (3) has been a householder for the last preceding 6 months, the house or premises being of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (4) is the holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l., the lease of which has 18 months to run; or (5) has been holder for the last preceding 18 months of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (6) has been the holder for the last preceding 6 months of a lease or license of Crown lands at an annual rental of 5l.; or (7) has his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Board in respect of property within the district.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Colonial Treasurer, the Director of Public Works (also Commissioner of Railways); the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Minister of Mines, the Attorney-General, and the Colonial Secretary.

Local Government.

Under Act 59 Vict., No. 10, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Beverley, Bunbury, Boulder, Bulong, Broad Arrow, Russelton, Carnarvon, Claremont, Coolgardie, Cossack, Cue, Day Dawn, Esperance, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Gingin, Guildford, Helena Vale, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Leederville, Mt. Magnet, Menzies, Nannine, Newcastle, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, Perth, Roebourne, Subiaco, Southern Cross, Victoria Park, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000 consist of a chairman and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and (for each ward) three councillors—the mayor or chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. Under The Water Works Act, 1889 (53 Vic. 13) the Perth City Council was authorized to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £, but this power was, under The Metropolitan Water Works Act (60 Vic. No. 19), transferred to the Metropolitan Water Works Board; also under The Health Act, 1898, local boards in the health of municipalities and other localities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 6d. in the £; 40,000l. was granted in 1898 to district roads boards (of which there were, at the end of 1898, 78) and municipal councils (86) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the colony.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the colony at the 31st December, 1898, was estimated to be 168,129, consisting of 112,054 males, and 56,075 females, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese was 1,876, of whom 1,867 were males and only 9 females. In June, 1899, the estimated population was 168,651.

The chief towns are Perth (39,600), Fremantle (15,700), Coolgardie (11,000), Kalgoorlie (20,000), Albany (3,200), Bunbury (3,000), Cue (1,050), Esperance (1,000), Geraldton (2,500), Guildford (1,300), Kanowna (2,500), Menzies (2,000), Norseman (1,200), Northam (1,500), York (1,400).

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the colony 6,292,421 acres only have been alienated or are in process of alienation, while 89,616,582 acres are leased for pastoral, and 1,453,447 for other purposes. No less than 527,194,350 acres are still unoccupied and fit for settlement. From Cape Naturaliste, the whole of the coast line, a length of 5,200 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. In the south-west corner of the colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of
the southern part of the Colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total area of arable land on 28th Feb., 1899, was 270,525 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,414,888) are depastured in all parts of the colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1898, principally to London, was 10,126,306 lbs., which, at 6½d. per lb. for greasy and 12½d. per lb. for scoured, is valued at £287,731. A considerable quantity of wine is also made. In 1898, 171,164 acres were under crops of all kinds.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 55°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1898 was valued at £26,195. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore, China, and other places to the value of about £31,812 during 1898.

At Shark Bay and on the north-west coast a fleet of more than 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounted to £98,784 in 1898.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but for the last few years little work has been done in them, owing to the fall in the value of these metals. The prospects in copper are, however, improving.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

Since the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining has become the principal industry of the Colony, and so rapidly has the annual output of gold increased of late, that it has now placed Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing Colonies of Australasia.

There are now 17 goldfields in existence—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Gascoyne, Murchison, East Murchison, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, and a large population is continually employed in searching for and extracting precious metals.

Much machinery is in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a great future before them, judging from the steady increase both in returns and population. The value of gold produced up to the end of July, 1899, was £13,519,206. In the first seven months of 1899 the value of the gold production was £3,286,551, against £2,081,164 in the corresponding period of 1898.

There is also good coal in the south-west corner of the Colony, and evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district. On the Collie Coalfield, situated in the Wellington district, three companies are now successfully working coal-leases. The output in 1898, at the end of which year only the mines began to be productive, was 3,250 tons, but the production is rapidly increasing.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood river, and the total export of this mineral to the end of 1898 is estimated at £76,227. There is little doubt that a fairly rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in very small quantities.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Australasia.

The deposits in the banks during the year ended 31st December, 1898, averaged £3,601,176, and the advances by the banks, £3,264,929.

A Government Post Office savings bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1883; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1896, amounted to £520,016; during the year ended 30th June, 1897, to £1,068,322; during the year ended 30th June, 1898, to £1,231,638; and during the year ended 30th June, 1899, to £1,057,033.

A branch of the Royal Mint has been erected in Perth.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are under the supervision of the Minister of Education, assisted by elected district boards. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (58 Vict., No. 30), and are enforced.

By the "Assisted Schools Abolition Act, 1895" (59 Vic., No. 27), the grants to private schools were discontinued, but a compensation was made to the schools that had so far received subsidy, the sum of £15,000 being divided amongst them in proportion to the grants received by them during 1895.

The amount expended on education for 1898 was £57,358, on school buildings £32,255. A high school is also subsidised by the State.

In the year 1898 there were 167 Government schools in the colony, with 14,424 scholars on the rolls, and 58 private schools, with 4,546 scholars. Total 16,808.

Means of Communication.

The Colony possesses at present (June, 1899) four lines of Government railways: The Eastern Railway (572 miles), connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with Perth, Guildford, Northam, Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, and Menzies, including branch lines from Clackline Junction to Newcastle (14 miles), from Spencer's Brook Junction to York and Beverley.
(38 miles), York to Greenhills (14 miles), Fremantle to Owens Anchorage (3 miles), and one mile to the Perth racecourse; also a branch line (7 miles) running out from Kalgoorlie to the Boulder; the Northern Railway, with a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay mining district, one from Geraldton to Walkaway (18 miles), and one from Mullewa to Cue (254 miles); the South-Western Railway (234 miles), from Perth to Bunbury, from Picton Junction to Vasse (38 miles), from Boyanup Junction to Bridgetown (52 miles), and from Brunswick Junction to Collie Coalfields (26 miles); and the Great Southern from Beverley to Albany (243 miles)—in all, 1,355 miles of railway open for traffic.

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Midland Junction and Walkaway, and connects the two Government railways.

There are also several lines constructed by private timber companies in the south of the colony, in extent about 217 miles.

The receipts of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1899, were £1,004,620, and the working expenses £712,329. The total cost of construction has been £4,427,370.

Of electric telegraph at the end of 1898 there were 8,650 miles of wire. The number of messages forwarded and received during 1898 was 1,178,928, and the revenue received 70,754l. (worked by Post Office Department). The cost of Post and Telegraph was £27,108l. There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and also by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 2,299 miles of private telephone wire in the colony, and 3,659 miles of railway telephone wire.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient, Messageries Maritimes, and Nord-Deutsche Lloyd Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the other Australasian colonies. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australasian colonies by the various intercolonial steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 30 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, Newspapers per ½-oz. papers |
|--------------------------------------|
| Within a Town                        | 1d. 1d. |
| Within the Colony                    | 2d. Free* |
| Australasia                          | 2d. ½d. per 10 ozs. |
| United Kingdom and Postal Union      | 2½d. 1d. per 4 ozs |

The postal statistics for 1898 give the following as the number (each counted once) of letters and postcards, &c., received and despatched:

| English, Inland, International, and Foreign |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Letters                                    | 6,750,917 6,342,071 |

| Postcards                                  | 238,545 63,167 |

* If printed and posted in the Colony for delivery beyond the boundaries of the city or town at which they may be published, and posted within one week from date of publication. Otherwise 1d. Free papers must not exceed 10 ozs., otherwise ½d.

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 161 vessels and a tonnage of 11,350 on 31st December, 1898. Harbour works there are progressing satisfactorily, the main portion of the work being completed.

Defence.

In December, 1898, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 724 of all ranks. Of this number 201 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder principally to the various rifle corps. King George's Sound, on the south coast, is strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office.

Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. The natives were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they used to be largely utilised as pearl-shell divers, whilst their industry was confined to moderately shallow waters. As a general rule they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned the successful mission conducted at New Norcia (by the Right Reverend Bishop Sadlier), which was commenced in the year 1846. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia was passed by the houses of legislature in 1897. In accordance with its clauses, the welfare of the natives is now entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a Minister of the Crown, and provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of 5,000l. to be used by this sub-department.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The mean average death-rate is 16 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 32·957 inches (for 23 years), and the mean temperature is 65°. The rainy season extends from May to October.
