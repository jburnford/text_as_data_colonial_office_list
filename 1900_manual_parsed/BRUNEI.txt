BRUNEI.

An agreement, in terms similar to that with Sarawak, was concluded, in 1888, with the Sultan of Brunei, a native state lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. Brunei is the state out of which the territories of the North Borneo Company and the Rajah of Sarawak have been carved, and appears to have been at one time powerful, claiming jurisdiction over the greater part of Borneo as well as over the Philippines. Its area is now only about 3,000 miles.

The outlying districts are Tutong, Blait, and Lawas, with others of less importance.

The authority of the Sultan is fast diminishing, and outside of the capital the natives are in a continual state of passive rebellion.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 12,000, including 70 Chinese. There are no European inhabitants, and the British Consul resides at Labuan. The Chinese are engaged in the manufacture and export of sago, supplying a cargo to a Singapore steamer which calls once every three weeks. Concessions of mining and timber rights have been granted to all comers, but the want of local labour deters serious work. Curios in brass and silver work, made by the natives, are attractive to visitors. Opium and gambling farms are let yearly, and monopolies on tobacco, etc., are granted, but the principal source of revenue is derived from the yearly cession payments by the North Borneo and Sarawak Governments. An oil boring company is being formed to work near the town of Brunei.
