ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. Besides the peninsula a strip of territory stretching about three miles inland belongs to England, the whole area being about eighty square miles. Dhala and El Hota are the principal villages outside the town of Aden. The rainfall never exceeds 7 inches per year. The town of Aden is situated on the side of a rocky promontory and is very strongly fortified. It is a most important coaling station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The imports in 1897-98 amounted to Rs. 4,40,66,865, and the exports to Rs. 3,74,80,382. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, &c. The settlement is subject to the Government of Bombay, being presided over by a Resident, who is also commander of the troops in the garrison. (For further information see publications relating to India.)

PERIM, an island about five square miles in area, situated at the entrance of the Red Sea, is a dependency of Aden, and is administered from that port. It is also an important coaling depot for the merchant marine, and contains a lighthouse.

The Arab chiefships between Aden and Muscat territory are also in subordinate treaty relations with the Government of India, these relations being within the charge of the Aden Residency.

SOCOTRA, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 19'—12° 42' N. lat., and 53° 21'—53° 30' E. long, and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belonged. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island is about 4,000, of Arab descent. It is 72 miles by 22 miles, with peaks 200 feet high. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October 1886; together with the neighbouring Abdal Kute and Dromers Islands.

In 1887 also a Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali coast, extending from Lahadu, half-way between Ras Jibuti and Zaila, to Bunder Ziadeh, in the 49th parallel E. long. The internal boundary has been settled by agreements with Italy and King Menelek of Abyssinia. Till 1898 the Somali Coast Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the charge of the Foreign Office, the head of the administration being the Administrator and Consul-General, Lieut.-Col. J. Hayne Soller. The chief ports are Barbeda, Ballad, and Zaila. The trade in 1897-98 was valued at Rs. 1,04,77,859, almost equally divided between imports and exports. The revenue of the Protectorate was Rs. 3,18,943 and the expenditure Rs. 2,34,862.
