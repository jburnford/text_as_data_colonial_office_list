NORTHERN NIGERIA.

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate of Northern Nigeria is bounded on the south by the Protectorates of Lagos and Southern Nigeria; the boundary, which is also the limit of the zone of "trade-liquor" importation, leaves the frontier of Dahomey in the latitude of Shatu, and, running east to the borders of Illorin, follows the frontier of that State round its western and southern limits, and is then drawn due east to Iddo on the Niger; thence its runs almost due east to meet the frontier of the German Kameruns a little south of Tarkum, practically following the 7th parallel of latitude. To the west it is bounded by the hinterland of French Dahomey, the line having been settled by the Convention of June, 1898. Skuta, Ashigiri and Illo fall within British Borga, while Tarakon and Nikki are included in the French sphere. Thence, crossing the Niger 10 miles north of Illo, the boundary follows the Dallub Mauri till it meets the arc of a circle drawn (with 100-mile radius) from Sokoto as a centre. On the north the French Sudan is conterminous with the Protectorate. From the point at which the arc of the circle described meets the 14th parallel the second time the boundary follows that parallel for 70 miles, then runs due south to parallel 13°–20° for 250 miles, then due north to the 14th, then along 14° to longitude 14°. On the east the 14th parallel of longitude, which nearly bisects Lake Chad, forms the boundary till it meets the south shore of Lake Chad. The Anglo-German frontier of the Kameruns impinges on Chad at the point where the river Jadsaram enters the Lake, and from this point the boundary is formed by a straight line drawn to the intersection of the 6° of latitude, with longitude 9°, deflected only by a circle of two miles radius drawn round the town of Yola so as to include it in the British territory. None of these boundaries of Northern Nigeria have as yet been surveyed and delimited on the ground. The Protectorate includes the Foulah Empire, of which the Sultan of Sokoto is the head, with its nominal dependencies of Nupe, Illorin, Muri, Saria, and Bautshi, together with the Tagan countries of Borgu to the west of the Niger, Bornu in the north-east towards Lake Chad, and the belt of Tagan tribes inhabiting the country south of the Benue, and lying between it and the northern frontier of Southern Nigeria. Pagan tribes also inhabit the country enclosed in the bend of the Niger between Illorin on the west and Southern Nigeria on the south (usually known as the Kalba country), and similar tribes form a more or less continuous belt along the northern and eastern banks of the Niger. The Hausa States of the Foulah Empire are Mohammedan, and are said to have the densest population of any country in the whole African Continent—estimated at millions. The area of the Protectorate is about 310,000 square miles. Iddo, the point on the Niger where the boundary between Northern and Southern Nigeria crosses the river, is about 200 miles as the crow flies from the mouth of the river, and about half the distance above the last of the creeks which form the mouth of the Niger. Lokoja is some 50 miles further, and is situated at the junction of the Niger and Benue. Under the Company's administration it formed the military headquarters, and it is now the principal station and garrison with the exception of the (temporary) headquarters at Jebba.

This latter place (a small island about a mile long by a quarter mile broad) marks the limit of navigation of the Niger, though steamers have with some risk ascended as far as the foot of the first rapid, Fort Goldie, some 30 miles further. The Port of Northern Nigeria is the Forcados river mouth in Southern Nigeria, where the Northern Protectorate will have a station (at Burutu) for purposes of transhipment, and also a depot for invalids and passengers arriving and leaving at Gulu Point.

At the end of the dry season (in July) the Niger is only navigable up to the mouth of the Kaduna, and for large steamers below the junction of the Benue at Lokojia.

The Niger Territories generally (that is to say Northern Nigeria and the country from Iddo to the coast, now included in Southern Nigeria) were secured to Great Britain by nearly 500 treaties made by the Royal Niger Company (formerly the National African Company, Limited), and recognized by the three Anglo-German Agreements of June, 1885, June, 1886, and November, 1893, and the Anglo-French Agreement of August, 1890. The agreements with Germany establish as an eastern frontier a line running from the Cross River to a little east of Yola, on the Upper Benue, and thence to a point on the south bank of Lake Chad 35 minutes east of the meridian of Kuka. The Anglo-French agreement of the 14th June, 1898, defined the western and northern frontiers.

History.

As far back as the 17th century British traders had had mercantile depots on the mouths of the Niger and adjacent rivers and creeks, known as the Oil rivers, and in these early times the trade was mainly confined to the traffic in slaves. At this epoch the French attempted a settlement at the mouth of the Niger, but were unsuccessful, and during the 18th century British interests preponderated. At the beginning of the 19th century the exploration of the upper river—which had hitherto been supposed to be identical with the Nile or Congo—began, and Mungo Park traced its course from Bamako to Bussa, where he lost his life in the rapids. Lander in 1830 demonstrated the identity of Mungo Park's river at Boussa, with the lower Niger, and followed its course to the sea. In the next two decades, 1840–60, efforts were made, both by the British Government and private individuals, as well as by French and German merchants, to develop the trade of the Niger, while our knowledge of the interior was greatly enlarged by the travels of Barth, Claperton, Allen and others, all British or under British initiation. A consulate was founded at Lokoja, and, at the cost of much money and many lives, some progress seemed to have been made, only to result in failure and fiasco. The pioneer of these efforts was McGregor Laird, who in 1852 began to establish stations in order to endeavour to secure the country for England, but these were destroyed by natives, and Laird lost both his money and his life. The good results of his work and of Croft's were not, however, entirely lost. The situation in the early seventies was that there were numerous trading towns—English, French and German—in the oil rivers, where the trade in palm oil had begun to assume importance, the imports being chiefly confined to "the vilest of spirits, guns and powder." The expeditions sent by the British Government to the higher river, and the
subsidies voted by Parliament, had been withdrawn, and European intercourse with the Niger would have ceased had it not been for the perseverance of four English and four Scotch firms, who during the four months of high water each sent a trading steamer up the river, and soon established a few primitive stations, where the white population of Nigeria (numbering from two to three) lived. These bold pioneers were at the mercy of the powerful chiefs, and gross outrages were from time to time avenged by the dispatch of a light draught gunboat. "The rivalry between these firms became so keen, and the importance of turning upon each other the disfavour of the chiefs was so great, that the necessity of white traders holding together for purposes of defence was overlooked."

At the close of 1877, Mr. Goldie-Taubman—now Sir G. Goldie-Taubman—visited the Niger and conceived the idea (to quote his own words), "that no lasting advance, either of commerce or civilization, was possible unless some government were established which would give peace and security both to natives and white men." In other words that amalgamation of interests and a settled government must replace the chaotic rivalry of traders. Recognising that continuity of government on the spot was an impossibility in the climatic conditions of Nigeria, while a government such as that established by Rajah Brooke in Sarawak would not have a secure international basis, Sir George Goldie determined to secure a charter for a British Company. After much negotiation the small British interests, which were the only ones existent on the Niger at that date, were amalgamated in the United African Company in 1879, and in 1881 a charter was applied for. The objection was raised that the capital of the Company was too small, and hence the National African Company was formed with a capital of a million sterling, with the object of opening up direct relations with the great potentates of the interior. With great energy the new company founded stations, sent out a river flotilla, and pushed up the Niger and Benue, but meanwhile the foresight of Gambetta had prompted the establishment of two French Companies, which being backed by the French Government, acquired a great influence on the Lower Niger. Of these the Compagnie du Sénégal had a capital of 600,000l., and some thirty French stations were formed, and while the French flag remained the charter could not, of course, be granted. The energy of Sir George Goldie, however, by lavish presents to chiefs, by the increase of the staff and stations, and by keen competition, secured the disappearance of the French flag just in time to announce at the Berlin Conference in 1885 that the British flag alone flew on the Niger, and to secure to Great Britain the guardianship of the international navigation rights on the Niger—while the French companies and rival British interests which had meantime grown up were absorbed in the National African Company.

In April, 1885, a new danger arose from the mission of Herr Flegel to secure treaties with Sokoto and Gandu on behalf of Germany, but he was anticipated by the British Company, who sent out Mr Thomson, and concluded treaties with those powerful emirs.

Great Britain was therefore able to conclude the Agreement of 1886 with Germany, which settled the frontiers between Nigeria and the Kamerun as far back as Yola, and in July, 1886, the long-delayed charter was granted, and the Company changed its title to that of the Royal Niger Company. Meanwhile the territories adjacent to the river had been placed under British protection.

The next decade was spent in building up an elaborate organization, in extending the sphere acquired, and in checking inter-tribal war, pagan sacrifices and slave raiding. The expeditions of Monteil to Lake Chad from the west, of Crampe from the south-east, and of Mizon by way of the Niger and Benue, were checkmated, and finally, in 1890, an agreement was arrived at with France by which the line dividing the French Sudan on the north from Nigeria was drawn with certain deflections from Say, on the Niger, to Barua, on Lake Chad, and in 1893 the Kamerun boundary was extended from Yola to the south of the same lake. Its international difficulties being for the moment less acute, the Company was able to face the great internal danger which for years had threatened its existence, and in 1897 the growing hostility of the great Foulah Power culminated in a plan to drive the white men out of the country. The Company had been quietly preparing, and had brought their military force to a high standard of efficiency, and they took the field (Sir George Goldie himself having planned every detail of the campaign and being present in person) with some 500 or 600 well-drilled soldiers, led by about 30 British officers, against 20,000 or 30,000 of the enemy, of whom a large proportion were the much-dreaded Foulah cavalry. Nupé, the vast dependency of Sokoto, which had thus challenged the Company's existence, was divided by the Niger into two nearly equal halves. The rapidity of the Company's movements gave no time to Sokoto to raise additional armies, and Southern Nupé was first conquered, and then Northern Nupé after a two-days' fight before the capital at Bida. Illorin, a smaller dependency was next subdued. Prior to this a march of nearly 200 miles, from Lokoja to Kabba, and thence to Egbon, had cleared all Southern Nupé of the Foulah slave raiders, and on the 26th June, 1897, the legal status of slavery in the Niger Territories was declared abolished by the Company. Simultaneously with this crisis another, which was to have far-reaching effects, arose. The only indeterminate frontier remaining was that to the west. The Company perceiving, in 1894, that French enterprise contemplated the annexation to Senegal and Dahomey of the Borgu country, sent out Capt. F. D. Lugard to negotiate treaties with the king or chiefs of that country. Anticipating the powerful French expeditions by only a few days, he succeeded in making treaties at the capital of Nikki, and with other semi-independent chiefs of districts. Disregarding these prior British treaties, a swarm of French expeditions spread over Borgu, and having obtained a pledge from our Government that Sir George Goldie's powerful expedition, then in the field against the Foulahs, should not advance N. of 9°, they invaded Boussa, with which we had a specific treaty of many years standing, and established themselves on the Niger at several points. At the end of 1897, in view of this situation, the British Government decided to raise a local force, and the task was confided to Colonel F. D. Lugard, who left England in March, 1898, and in the following April had a strong force in the field. After a period of great tension, during which the British and French troops faced each other, and a conflict was daily imminent, a con-
vention was signed (June 14th) laying down a boundary line from the intersection of the 9th parallel with the frontier of Dahomey to Illo on the Niger, and thence to the northern frontier, which was more accurately defined, to Lake Chad, and to its junction with the German Kamerun frontier. Meanwhile the great internal source of danger had been removed by the breaking of the Fulani power, while the army of the conquering chief Rabah, which had penetrated from the Nile Valley to Lake Chad, and had conquered Bornu, was arrested in its onward march to Kano by the news of the Company's victories; and thus returned to the south of Lake Chad where the British, French and German territories converged.

The Imperial force, called the West African Frontier Force, with a "Commissioner and Commandant" at its head, and independent of the Company, was quartered in the country, with its headquarters at Jebba, and with numerous detachments holding the posts evacuated by the French throughout Borgu, and a strong garrison at Lokoja. This force consisted of two battalions of Infantry, commanded by Lieut.-Colonels Pilcher and Fitzgerald; three batteries of Artillery, under the command of Major Robinson, R.A.; a Sapper company of Madrassas and locals under Lieut. McClintock, R.E.; three hospitals, completely organised with a large nursing staff (a new departure in the Interior of Africa), with Dr. Poole as P.M.O.; a Transport department, and an Accounts department. It was raised and organised by Colonel Lugard, with Lieut.-Colonel Willcocks, C.M.G., D.S.O., as second in command, and Major Booth as Staff Officer, and consisted equally of Hausas and Yorubas. The battalions had a normal establishment of 1,260 rank and file each. The R.A. mounted 175, and the Sappers 46. The complement of officers, infantry and R.A., was 66, with 106 British N.C.O.'s. Eight doctors, with 14 N.C.O.'s, R.M.A.C., and three female nurses, formed the Medical Staff. The Transport numbered four white men and the Accounts five, the R.E. one officer and five N.C.O.'s, making a total of 217 white men and close on 2,700 natives. It was constituted on a basis of active service as "in military occupation of a foreign country," and its constitution, movements, and discipline were effected and controlled by means of "Frontier Force Orders" by the Commandant.

The Royal Niger Company had, from its earliest origin, set its face against the importation of trade liquor, and had imposed in the Delta area, where alone the import was allowed, a higher duty than in the neighbouring "Niger Coast Protectorate." This had, of course, led to smuggling by natives, who, moreover, could not understand the arbitrary frontiers fixed by latitudes and longitudes, while the middle-men, who had in past years controlled the trade of the interior, were exterminated by the loss of their accustomed profits. This culminated in January, 1885, in an attack by the natives of Brass upon the Company's station at Akassa, resulting in great loss of life and destruction of property. The British Government sent out a punitive expedition against the town of Brass, and 20,000l. was paid as indemnity to the Company. Sir J. Kirk, K.C.B., G.C.M.G., was sent out as special commissioner to report on the causes which led to this outrage, and to make recommendations. He proposed that the Company should cease to trade, and become purely administrative, and that a revenue should be assigned to them for Governmental purposes, consisting of a proportion of the total receipts by Lagos and the N.C.P., on the coast of which Nigeria formed the Hinterland. This scheme was not approved, and it was decided that the charter should be revoked, and that the administrative rights and powers of the Royal Niger Company should be transferred to the Crown. Steps to this end were taken at the end of 1898, when the negotiations with the French Government had been disposed of, and the transfer took place on January 1st, 1900. The terms of the arrangement made between Her Majesty's Government and the Company are given in the Parliamentary paper C, 9372.

**Constitution**

In connection with the transfer to the Crown, an Order in Council was issued at the end of 1899, constituting the "Protectorate of Northern Nigeria" over the territories of the River Niger Co., with the exception of a portion of them, stretching from Iddo to the coast, which by a contemporaneous instrument was incorporated in the Niger Coast Protectorate, and with those territories was named the "Protectorate of Southern Nigeria."

The government of the Royal Niger Company was conducted chiefly from England by the Governor and Council, who initiated all legislation, and from whom emanated all orders regarding the employment of the troops on punitive expeditions, &c. The same body revised the sentences of the Supreme Court, which was set up at Asaba, the capital, and which consisted of two judges who alternately served in Africa. Three senior executive officers had the general administration of the divisions of the country under the control of the Agents-General, Mr. W. Wallace, C.M.G., and Mr. J. Flint. Sub-divisions of district officers were under the control of district officers, who held small cause courts. A civil gaol under a governor was erected at Asaba.

In the new administration a High Commissioner has been appointed, and three residents will be provided for the three Provinces of Kano, Benue, and Middle Niger, with six assistant presidents. A supreme court serves as a Court of Appeal for both Southern and Northern Nigeria, the presidents, who are entrusted with large powers, holding "Provincial Courts." An Attorney-General acts as legal adviser to the Government. The provinces of Borgu and Bornu for the present remain as "Military provinces." There is no Legislation or Executive Council, and the High Commissioner has power to issue ordinances which are operative until disallowed.

The W.A.F.F. remains as the military force of the Protectorate, under the command of Col. Willcocks, C.M.G., D.S.O., with Lt.-Col. Kemball, R.A., as second in command. Major O'Neill commands the Artillery, and Lt.-Cols. Lowry-Cole and Morland command the two battalions, with which has been incorporated the River Niger Constabulary.

**Climate and Products**

The lower portion of the Territories in the Niger delta has a bad reputation for its climate. In this region are produced the palm oil and palm kernels which form a large portion of the exports from the Territories.

The regions further inland are stated to be much healthier, while their principal products are rubber, hides, ground nuts, shea butter, ivory, chillies, and various drugs.

The chief imports are cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, powder, salt, silks, spirits, and woollen goods. The Company prohibited the importation
of rifles, breech-loading guns, cartridges, &c., into any part of the Territories. They also prohibited the importation of spirits into the upper portions of their territories, and put heavy duties on their introduction into the lower portions, so that the importation of spirits became less than one-fourth of what it was before the charter.

There were no import duties excepting on guns, powder, salt, spirits, and tobacco, and the revenue was chiefly raised by export duties. Under the new administration the duties will be those of Southern Nigeria as regards imports brought in through that Protectorate, and will be collected there.

Means of Communication.

There are telegraph stations at Brass and Bonny, in cable communication with Lagos, and thus with Europe. A telegraph line was constructed in 1897-98 from Lagos to Jebba and has been extended to Lokoja, from which point it is being carried up the Benue to Ibi. Regular steamers arrive and depart from Liverpool and the West Coast of Africa every three weeks. Communication in the Niger Basin is mainly by the steamers of the Royal Niger Company.
