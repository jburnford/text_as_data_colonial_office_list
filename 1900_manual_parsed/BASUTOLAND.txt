BASUTOLAND.

Situation and Area.

Basutoland forms an irregular oval in the north-east of the Cape Colony; the main axis, about 150 miles in length, lying in a north-easterly direction. The Orange Free State, Natal, and the Cape Colony form its boundaries. Its area is estimated at 10,293 square miles, or nearly as large as Belgium.

It lies between 29° and 30° degrees South Lat., and between 27° and 28° degrees East Long.

Description and Climate.

The territory, which is well watered, and enjoys an excellent climate, is the finest grain producing country in South Africa, and the abundant grass enables the Basutos to rear immense herds of cattle. The scenery is grand, and in many parts extremely beautiful.

The Maluti Mountains, forming a part of the great Drakensberg chain, occupy most of the country, which is really one continuous elevated plateau, though broken and rugged. The extension of arable culture has tended to drive the cattle more and more into the high grounds. The mean temperature during the year 1895-6 was 58° Fahr., the absolute maximum being 94° and absolute minimum 17°. The rainfall was 40 inches.

The climate is perfect for Europeans and natives alike, and when more easily reached the country will prove a great health resort. Its high altitude and pure atmosphere prove most invigorating. Phthisis pulmonalis is almost unknown except among the section of natives who have taken to wearing clothes, and Europeans who have come to the country on account of their disease. The latter in early stages of the disease improve at once. Persons suffering from malarial fever or its results are benefited greatly by a short residence in Basutoland. Leprosy imported from the Orange Free State and Cape Colony has now a firm hold in the country, one in every 2,500 persons being a leper. As yet it has been possible to do little to check the spread of the disease.

Population and Industry.

In 1875, when Basutoland formed part of the Cape Colony, at the general census of the Colony taken in that year, the European population of Basutoland was 499, and the native 127,707. At the census of 1891, the population numbered 578 Europeans and 218,324 natives.

The statistics, stock, etc., in 1875 were, 35,257 horses, draught cattle 28,626, other 188,791; sheep, wooled, 240,270, other 49,537; goats, angora, 13,592, other 147,162; pigs 13,237; ploughs 2,770, harrows 269. In 1891 the number of horses was 81,194, of cattle 320,234, of ploughs 10,434, and of wagons 808, showing an enormous increase in the wealth of the country. Probably at least three-fourths of the cattle perished during the outbreak of rinderpest in 1897.

Maseru, the capital, and largest town, has a population of 862, of whom 99 are Europeans.

The productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron and copper; and coal has been found and is used in some parts, two mines being actively worked for local supply.

History.

The Basutos appear to have been composed of the remnants of several tribes which were broken up in the wars waged by Mosilikatze, the king of the Matabele, in the early years of the present century. These remnants were united in about 1818 under Moseshi, a chief of great ability, who ruled for many years.

In 1852 war broke out between Moseshi and the British Government; the Basutos were defeated by Sir G. Cathcart at the battle of the Berea Mountain, and Moseshi sent in his submission, and made peace.

A few years later, in 1856, disputes arose between Moseshi and the Orange Free State respecting boundary questions, and hostilities resulted which lasted from 1856 to 1858, with indeci-
sive results, and were concluded by the Treaty of Aliwal, 1858, but collisions frequently recurred.

In 1865 the war broke out afresh, and Mosesh again claimed the protection of the Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse. He declined to interpose actively, but despatched a British Commissioner to Thaba Bosigo, the capital of Basutoland, to settle the difficulties. This measure met with little success, and in the end the Boers were successful, and Mosesh sued for peace. At the treaty of Thaba Bosigo, April 1866, he recognised the permanent cession of a portion of his district and acknowledged himself a subject of the Orange Free State.

The peace was of short duration, the war was renewed, and the Basutos, pressed by the Boers, were on the brink of destruction, when they again appealed to be taken under the authority of the Queen, and in January, 1867, Sir Philip Wodehouse received authority to recognise Mosesh and his tribe as British subjects and for the incorporation of their territory. This was carried into effect by a proclamation dated 12th March, 1868.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition, until it was annexed to the Cape by an Act of the Cape Legislature, No. 12 of 1871. The Act expressly declared that Basutoland was not to be subject to the general law of the Colony, and gave the Governor power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein.

The subsequent history of Basutoland was one of much political disturbance.

In March, 1873, Moirosi, the chief of the Quithing district, in the south-east of Basutoland, rescued from justice his son Doda, who had been arrested for horse-stealing; and, on the Colonial authorities demanding his surrender, broke out into open defiance of its authority. Owing to the great natural strength of his country and stronghold, considerable difficulty was experienced in subduing him; but in December of that year, his stronghold was carried by storm, and he himself fell in the assault.

The proposals of the Colonial Government to divide the territory occupied by the adherents of this chief into lots for occupation by European settlers gave rise to a great discontent among the Basutos who had remained loyal. This discontent was further increased by the extension of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, providing for a general disarmament, to Basutoland by Proclamation in April, 1880, and culminated in the revolt of almost the whole tribe when an attempt was made to put the Act in force.

The rebellion spread to the native territories east and south of Basutoland, East Griqualand, Tampiekland, and the Pondomisi, where the rising was signalled by the treacherous murder of Mr. Hopkin, magistrate, and other Europeans.

Strenuous efforts were made by the Colony to reduce the Basutos to submission by force of arms, but without decisive success, though the loss of their cattle, and the interruption of cultivation, caused great distress amongst them. Early in 1881 overtures for an arrangement were made by the leading chiefs, and, at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, the High Commissioner acted as arbiter between the Colonial Government and the Basutos.

The terms of his award were, the registration of arms, the payment of compensation to those natives who had remained loyal to the tribe, and also the payment of a fine of 5,000 head of cattle. The award was accepted by the Basutos and the fine paid, but little was done towards fulfilling the other conditions. The Colonial Ministry, with a view to facilitate a settlement, cancelled the award and induced the Cape Parliament to assume the burden of compensating the loyals. The Disarmament Proclamation was also repealed, and in a Free State on the 24th of April, 1883, a new liberal constitution was offered to the Basutos. Masupha, however, the chief of the Maseru district, with several other chiefs of influence, held aloof, and practically declared their intention to have no further connexion with the Colonial Government, and the tribe generally were understood to wish to be under the direct authority of the Imperial Government. In the meantime a strong feeling in favour of the entire abandonment of Basutoland had grown up in the Colony, and on the request of the Colonial Ministry the Imperial Government decided to undertake for a time the administration of the country on condition that satisfactory evidence was given by the Basutos of their desire to remain under the British Crown, that the Orange Free State should undertake to cause the frontier to be respected by its subjects, and that the colony should pay over towards the cost of administration the customs duties received on goods imported into Basutoland. This offer was accepted by the Colony, and provision was made in the Basutoland Disannexation Act of 1883 for the payment of 20,000£ a-year, and the Free State also intimated its willingness to comply with the conditions so far as it was concerned.

A public meeting of Pitso of the Basutos was held on the 29th of November, 1883, attended by the representatives of more than two-thirds of the whole tribe, who unanimously expressed their willingness to comply with the conditions on which the Imperial Government was prepared to assume the responsibility of the administration of the country. Several important chiefs who were not at the Pitso subsequently expressed their concurrence in this resolution, Masupha alone refusing to accept the offers of the Government and desiring to remain independent. Her Majesty's Government upon this decided that their conditions were such as to comply with, revised the Queen to sanction the Disannexation Act, and immediately took steps for carrying on the government under the immediate authority of the Crown, from the 13th March, 1884. Masupha tendered his submission in 1886, and asked for a magistrate to be resident in his district.

**Constitution.**

The territory is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for South Africa, the latter possessing the legislative authority, which is exercised by proclamation.

The Chiefs adjudicate on cases between natives, with a right of appeal to the Magistrates' Courts, where all cases between the natives and Europeans are brought.

For fiscal and other purposes the country is divided into 7 districts, namely, Maseru, Leribe, Cornet Spruit, Berea, Mafeteng, Quithing, and Quare Nek. Each of the districts is subdivided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the Mosesh family. The revenue arises from the Cape contribution, the post office, native hut-tax, and the sale of licences.

Serious crime is rare, and the drinking habits, which threatened to destroy the people, have been practically abandoned owing to the im-

* Since reduced to 18,000£.
fluence of the leading chiefs, the Missionaries, and the Government. There is now not a single canteen in the country. The area under arable cultivation steadily increases, and there is less and less tendency to stock-thieving and petty warfare.

**Education.**

Excellent work is being carried on in the country by Missionaries, in whose hands the labour of education is almost exclusively vested. There are 144 schools, with 8,438 scholars, nine-tenths being in the schools of the French Protestant Mission. There are two small Government schools, and grants in aid of education to the extent of £3,746 were made for the year 1897-98.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no navigable waterways, the rivers being low in winter and flooded generally in summer. The usual mode of conveyance is by ox-waggons or light cart.

The roads in the country are now in good condition for any kind of transport, but the periodical rains draining down from the high watersheds seriously damage them. There are no railways in the country.

The line of postal communication is through the Cape Colony and Orange Free State. There is a weekly mail service by carts, and letters to and from Europe take about 22 days, to Cape Town 4 days. Postal rates are similar to those of the Cape Colony. The parcels post and money order systems have been extended to Basutoland. The telegraph stations are Maseru and Mafeteng, whence there is direct communication with Cape Town.

**Trade.**

Imports for the year ended December, 1897, amounted to £100,280., and the exports were estimated at £132,030l. The imports consist chiefly of blankets, ploughs, saddlery, clothing, iron and tin ware, and groceries.

The exports consist chiefly of grain, cattle, and wools. The commercial intercourse is almost exclusively with the Cape Colony and the Orange Free State.

Basutoland from the 1st July, 1891, has been admitted into a Customs Union with the Cape Colony and the Orange Free State, by which arrangement a share of customs duties collected at the ports of the Cape Colony is credited to Basutoland, but retained by the Cape Government on account of the annual contribution of £18,000l.

**Currency and Banking.**

There are no banks in the Territory, but a Government Post Office savings bank has been established. The currency is exclusively British, but exchange, and even the payment of taxes, is still largely conducted by barter.

**BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE.**

**Situation and Area.**

The territory of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the south by the Cape Colony, on the east by the South African Republic, on the north by the British South Africa Company’s territory and the Zambesi River, and on the west by German territory. Its area is estimated at about 386,200 square miles, and the native population at about 100,000. The European population does not exceed 500.

**History.**

During the year 1885 Sir Charles Warren, who was in command of an expedition despatched from England to pacify Southern Bechuanaland, where for some time previously hostilities had been proceeding between the Bechuanas and Boers from the South African Republic, visited the principal chiefs in Northern Bechuanaland (known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate) Khama, Gasiisse, and Sebele, and as a result a British Protectorate was proclaimed over their territories. No further steps were taken until the year 1891, when by an Order in Council dated 9th May, the limits of the Bechuanaland Protectorate were more clearly defined, and the High Commissioner was authorised to appoint such officers as might appear to him to be necessary to provide for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue, and generally for the peace, order, and good government of all persons within the limits of the Order. Sir Sidney Shippard, the Administrator of Bechuanaland, was appointed Resident Commissioner, and an Assistant Commissioner was appointed for the Northern Protectorate, and another for the Southern Protectorate.

For fiscal and several other purposes the Protectorate was treated as a portion of the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland, until the latter was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 15th November, 1895. In the autumn of that year arrangements were made for the transfer of the administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, with the exception of certain reserves for native chiefs, to the British South African Company, and the Company’s police were moved down to a camp in the Protectorate at Pitseani Potlogo. On the 29th of December Dr. Jameson, with his police, crossed the border of the South African Republic and marched towards Johannesburg, which was at
the time in a state of great unrest, but being defeated by the Boers at Doornkop, surrendered on the 2nd January, 1896. As a consequence of this raid the administration of the Protectorate was not transferred to the Company. Since the annexation of British Bechuanaland to the Cape the Protectorate has been governed as a separate territory under the name of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and the form of government is very similar to that which obtains in Basutoland.

There is a Resident Commissioner, who is under the direction of the High Commissioner, and there are two Assistant Commissioners, one stationed at Palapye, Khama's Town, in the Northern Protectorate, and the other at Gaborone, in the Southern Protectorate. For the maintenance of law and order there is a Division of the B.S.A. Police, with 10 officers and 130 rank and file, and a force of native police with 4 officers, who are subordinate to the Commandant of the European force. These troops are stationed in small detachments at various places in the Protectorate. The headquarters is at Mafeking, in British Bechuanaland, which also remains the headquarters of the Resident Commissioner.

Climate, &c.

The climate is generally healthy excepting on the north-eastern border along the Crocodile River, where, during the summer months, malarial fever is prevalent.

The principal chiefs are:

1. Sekgomi, who lives at Lake N'Gami, near to which there is a small detachment of police.
2. Khami, Chief of the Banuangwato, whose town is Palapye.
3. Linchwe, Chief of the Bakhatla, who lives at Mochudi.
4. Sebele, Chief of the Bakwena, who lives at Molepolole.
5. Batho, Chief of the Bangwaketsi, who lives at Ramoutsu.

The railway connecting Bulawayo with the Cape has now been carried through the Protectorate, and is likely to prove of great advantage to the territory. It is worked by the Cape Government Railway, and the postal department is administered by the Postmaster-General of the Cape Colony.

The estimated expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1899, is £9,331/., and the estimated revenue £15,330/.. Of the estimated expenditure £20,000/.. is for a subsidy to the Railway Company.
