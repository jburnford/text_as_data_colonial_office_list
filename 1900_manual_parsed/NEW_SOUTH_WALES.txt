NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.

The Colony of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 153rd meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the Colony of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the Colony follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three Colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the Colony is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the Colony follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary, the Dumaresq; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dumaresq. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence, almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area comprised within these limits is estimated at 310,700 square miles, or 198,848,000 acres, being a little over two and a-half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area would be 195,882,150 acres, or about 306,066 square miles.

The length of the Colony, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 680 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 760 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 850 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' 41" S. lat., and 151° 12' 42" 15" E. long.

Of the total area of the Colony, 46,388,590 acres have been alienated, or are in the process of alienation.

History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, and gave it the name of New South Wales, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, when the convict station (intended for Botany Bay) was established at Port Jackson under Captain Phillip, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The population in 1800 was 4,958. The Merino sheep was introduced in 1797. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access
to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. Moreton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 36,598. Convicts ceased to arrive in 1841. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Bourke, where the mean in shade in 1898 was 43°5', to Bourke, Clarence Heads, and Lismore, where it was 69°-69°5', 61°6°5' respectively. On the coast varied from 59° to 65°, Brisbane 65°, and Albury, Sydney being 63°5', almost the same as Barcelona. On the mountains snow lies in some places all the winter. At Bathurst the mean temperature was 58°3', and on the inland plains about 64°9'.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The total fall during 1898 at Sydney was 42-97 inches, and the days on which rain fell 138. At London, the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while Sydney in 149 days has 42-97 inches. Fifty years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The export of wool the produce of the Colony during the past ten years has been as follows:—

Means of Communication.

There are 49,916 miles of Government roads, 10,379 of which are metalled and gravelled or ballasted. In addition there are 3,225 bridges of 20 feet span and over, covering a length of 286,885 feet; 34,731 culverts (under 20 feet span), = 511,393 feet, and 16,106 causeways, = 393,878 feet.

Nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, and the Hunter, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Port Said), the Orient lines (via Colombo and Naples), and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Mauritius and Marseilles), Union Company (via San Francisco), Canadian Australian line (via Vancouver), North German Lloyd (via Colombo and Port Said). Seven mails per month are sent to and received from England.

The rates of postage are:

- Letters, Newspapers:
  - Within any town: 1d.
  - Within the Colony: 2d.
  - Within Australasia: 2½d.
  - United Kingdom and its Colonies, and Postal Union Countries: 2½d.

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Education Act of 1880. Teachers are recognised as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The school fee is 3d. per week per child, and the fees collected are paid into the Treasury as revenue. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

In 1898, there were 2,602 State schools divided into 2,817 departments in operation, namely, 5 high schools, 2 for boys and 3 for girls, 1,787 public schools, 313 provisional schools, 431 half-time schools, 37 house-to-house schools under itinerant teachers, and 29 evening public schools. The Colony has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction is imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective churches. For the year 1898 the net cost to the State of public instruction was about 656,829L. In 1898, 227,561 children attended the ordinary State schools, and 1,310 were inmates of the orphan schools, industrial schools, ragged schools, and the school for the deaf and dumb and the blind. In 1898, private schools, including Church schools, showed a total enrolment of 58,173 and an average attendance of 45,354.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1852. Its State endowment was originally 5,000L, and from 1890 to 1892 was as high as 13,900L, but it has now been reduced to 9,000L. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The State endowment and special grants for 1898 amounted to 11,200L. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of 500L per annum. In addition, there is the women's college, also affiliated, having a similar endowment. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and engineering. Recently, several faculties have been added to its curriculum. The number of students in 1898 was 465. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, with an enrolment of 587 pupils, and having a State endowment of 1,500L. There is also a technical college, under the Department of Education, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns. The fees are within the reach of all, and the college is open to males and females alike. During 1898—212 classes were held, and 8,518 students attended; the Government advanced the sum of 19,622L. during the year. Public libraries and schools of art are established throughout the colony. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnean, a
Zoological, a Geographical, and two Art Societies, a Government Observatory, with many other educational associations of a like character. The year's expenditure for the Public Library of New South Wales was £1,234; for the Museum, £645; and for the National Art Gallery, £412.

The total State grant available for 1898-9 for educational purposes was about £1.

Defence.

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, George and Bradley's Heads, also at Newcastle and Botany, and along the coast.

The Military Forces consist of—Permanent Troops, Headquarters Staff, 25; Ordnance Staff, 34; Permanent Staff, 81; Artillery, 528; Engineers, (Submarine Miners), 49; Army Service Corps, 10; Army Medical Corps, 12. Partially Paid Troops.—Lancers, 388; Mounted Rifles, 363; Field Artillery, 134; Garrison Artillery, 396; Engineers, Field, 116; Engineers, Submarine Miners, 1; Engineers, Electricians, 74; Infantry—1st Regiment, 501; 2nd Regiment, 690; 3rd Regiment, 617; 4th Regiment, 613; Army Service Corps, 50; Army Medical Corps, 111; Volunteers—Infantry—1st Australian Volunteer Horse, 374; Scottish Rifles, 350; Irish Rifles, 275; St. George's Rifles, 452; Australian Rifles, 521; National Guard, 147; Railway Volunteer Corps, 1; Honorary Chaplain, 1; Hospital Medical Officers, 29; Strength of Rifle Club Reserves, 1,500. Total 18,722.

The Naval Forces are: a Naval Brigade, numbering 382, and 225 Naval Artillery Volunteers, both sections partially paid. The Naval Defence Force Staff, and the staff of the two Torpedo Boats, number 9 men. There is a total force (military and naval) of 9,288 of all ranks.

Local Government.

This is regulated mainly by Act No. 13 of 1887. Under this Act there have been established 184 boroughs and 18 municipal districts, controlling property of a value of £7,379,350, and having a revenue in 1897-98 of £745,819, exclusive of loans, an expenditure of £811,994, and an outstanding debt of £2,727,569; but against this are accumulated sinking funds of £256,742.

The chief towns and their population will be found at p. 187.

Constitution.

The first legislative council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than five shall be members not holding office under the Crown, except officers on H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay.

The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council still preserves its 23 ex-officio members, who are not paid with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry.

The Legislative Assembly, under the Electoral Act of 1880 (44 Vict., No. 13), consisted of 141 members, representing 74 electoral districts; and provision was made for giving increased representa-

tion to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extended to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise was given, subject to certain qualifications, and other exceptions, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. Resident Electors.—Six months in District.

2. Non-Resident Electors.—Every subject, whether or not resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 100l., or of the annual value of 10l. respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have received with the said estate the rent, or the annual value of 10l.; or who shall hold, and for the said 6 months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

A new Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1893, provided for the division of the Colony into 125 electorates, each represented by one member. This Act also abolished the property qualification and plural voting, and established the "one-man-one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalized subject, and who shall have resided in the Colony for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district in which he holds the elector's right, is qualified as an elector. As this was found to practically disfranchise a large number of the population, the period was by an amending Act passed in 1896 reduced to one month, during which period the elector retains his qualification in the electorate from which he has removed. Under this law the elections all take place on the same day in each electorate, under this law took place on July 17th, 1894; the second on July 24th, 1895; and the third on July 27th, 1898. Under an amending Act passed in 1896, the franchise has been conferred on members of the police force, who are all in the employment of the State, and not controlled by local bodies.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Acts of 1858 and 1880, now repealed.

The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved. Under a law passed in 1889, members receive 300l. per annum each.
