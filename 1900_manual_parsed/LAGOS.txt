LAGOS.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Lagos is situated on the Bight of Benin, and consists of the coast line from the boundary of Dahomey on the west, to Ode on the Mahin Beach on the east, and includes Badagry, Lagos Island (the capital of the Colony), Ebute Motta, Iddo Island, Ikorodu Ejirin, and Epe, with Palma, Leckie, and Ode.

Ikorodu is the latest acquisition to the Colony (ceded August, 1894), and the Jebu strip on the north bank of the lagoon now extends from Orichi on the Ogun River, in a direct line half a mile to the north of the village of Majoda, situated on the road between Epe and Jebu Ode, and from thence proceeding due east to the Oshun River. By this acquisition the Colony commands all the main routes to the Interior.

The Protectorate before 1900 comprised the kingdoms of Pokra, Okeodan, Ilaro, Addo, and Igbesa, with the Awori Country, Jebu Remo (1894), Mahin, Itebu, Ayran, and Ibu, up to the town of Ogbo on the east, where it adjoins the territory of the Niger Coast Protectorate.

By an Order in Council issued at the end of 1899, the Protectorate was extended to the boundaries of Northern and Southern Nigeria. It includes the whole of the Yoruba country.

The boundary with Dahomey is at the coast at 2° 46' 35" east long, and was delimited in 1896 by an Anglo-French Commission as far as the 9th parallel.

For administrative purposes the country is divided into the central, the western, the north-western, the eastern, and the north-eastern districts, with district commissioners stationed respectively at Lagos, Badagry, Ikorodu, Leckie, and Epe. In the Hinterland, resident officers are stationed at Ibadan, Jebu Ode, Ogbomostro, and Shaki. There is also a superintendent of native affairs at Abeokuta.

Lagos Island has an area of 33 square miles, and the whole Colony and Protectorate probably includes about 1,500 square miles.

The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Freetown, 315 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass. At this part of the West Coast a series of low islands runs along the coast, separating the mainland from the sea, and forming numerous lagoons and creeks. Along
these lagoons steamers ply, without entering the ocean, as far as Porto Novo on the west and Benin country on the east; and the only opening for many miles to the sea is at Lagos. Vessels drawing more than ten feet cannot safely get through the bar; passengers are transferred into tenders or surf boats, and the vessels proceed with most of their cargoes to Forcados, a distance of 200 miles, and there tranship into tenders.

**History.**

The King of Lagos (Kosoko), having refused to co-operate in putting down the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akitoye's son and successor, King Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown, in consideration of a pension of £1,000 a-year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate Government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further letters patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Iddo Island. In 1892, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Ketoum, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Ketoum, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1885, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.

In 1890, Ketoum was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagry.

In 1891 the kingdoms of Igbesa, Addo and Ilaro were included in the Protectorate, and in 1894 John Remo was similarly dealt with, Mahin, Itetu, Ibu, and Ayessan being proclaimed protectorates in 1895.

An expedition was sent against the Jebus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Colony of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

**Constitution.**

The Government is conducted by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The latter includes four nominated unofficial members. The law consists entirely of local ordinances and Orders in Council, with such English Acts as are of direct application.

The Colony is associated with Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast Colony in contributing towards the salary of the Bishop of Sierra Leone and towards the subsidy paid for telegraph maintenance. It also contributes towards the total cost of the audit of the accounts of the Colony by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.

**Industry.**

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, and brickmaking. A saw mill has recently been established, and native builders, carpenters, and blacksmiths do fair work.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the inland waters, the fish being dried and sent into the interior.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. A very extensive trade has therefore grown up, amounting, in 1893, to over a million and a half sterling. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, country cloths, rum, geneva, specie, and tobacco.

The chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France. The quantities and values of the principal exports during 1896 were: palm kernels, 47,649 tons, value £43,206; palm oil, 3,154,333 gals., value £205,553; cotton goods, value £159,151; country cloths, value £2,535; rum, 14,047½ gals., value £1,368; geneva, 1,364 gals., value £101; specie, £68,704; tobacco, £141,128; lbs., value £2,985; rubber, 6,484,368 lbs., value £47,722.

**Chief Towns.**

Lagos town has now about 33,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the whole West African coast. Epe is probably the largest town in the Colony outside Lagos, population about 6,000. The next largest towns are Badagry, with a population of 4,022, Leckie, and Ikorodu. In the interior Abeokuta and Ibadan are believed to contain about 150,000 and 260,000 inhabitants respectively.

**Currency and Banking.**

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with some Spanish, American, and French gold coins. Cowries (£1,000 = 3½d.) are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders. A Government savings bank was established on the 1st January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on 31st December, 1896, held deposits amounting to £13,4017. Is. 3½d.

During 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged in a company named The Bank of British West Africa.

**Means of Communication.**

A railway is in course of construction via Ota to Abeokuta, a distance of about 60 miles, and the section beyond to Badan (66 miles) is to be surveyed. The terminus will be on Iddo Island, connected by bridges with the mainland and with Lagos. Lagos Island is now in telegraphic communication with the Congo, South Africa, Bonny and Brass, the Gold Coast, and Europe, and via Accra, with the Gaboon, Louango, Kutumu, and Porto Novo, and there is also a land line con-
LAGOS.

Connecting it with Saki and Jebba on the Niger. There is also a weekly mail service to and from these places, and communication about once a month with Hamburg. With Brazil and the United States there is frequent communication by sailing vessels. The internal communication is chiefly by water, along the network of lagoons. There is telephonic communication between the various government offices.

Fees are charged, and education is not compulsory. The Mohammedans, who are much on the increase, maintain their own schools, where Arabic is taught.
