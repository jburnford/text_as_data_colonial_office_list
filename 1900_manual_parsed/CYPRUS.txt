CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syrie to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

It has been now systematically surveyed, and its area is 3,584 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles; its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Mesaoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrena Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kornakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending then eastward, along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest
summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the English troops, and of the High Commissioner who administers the Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

History.

Cyprus was colonized by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too long and eventful to be here related even in outline. When the Roman Empire was divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and was governed by lieutenants of the Byzantine Emperors until 1191, when Richard I of England occupied the island to chastise the ruler, Isaac Comnenus, for the ill-treatment of the English fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could not govern it, the King made it over to Guy de Lusignan, who claimed to be King of Jerusalem, and undertook the obligation of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 until 1489, when Queen Catarina Cornaro, herself a Venetian and widow of James II, having survived her husband and his posthumous son, James III, yielded the government of the island to the Republic of Venice. Venice ruled the island until 1570-71, when the Ottoman Turks invaded it, and captured and put to the sword the Venetian garrisons.

The island remained under the government of the Sultans of Constantinople from 1571 until 1878, with the exception of the period from 1832 to 1840, when it was held by the Pasha of Egypt, then at war with the Porte. It may be observed that the island was frequently invaded by the Arabs, Saracens, and Egyptians before its final conquest by the Turks, and that from 1245 to 1571 it paid tribute to Egypt. The great fortress and port of Famagusta was held by the Genoese Republic from 1373 until 1464, when the Lusignan king, James II, retook it with the help of the Egyptians.

Climate.

The mean temperature is about 69° Fah.; mean maximum 78°; mean minimum 57°. Highest shade temperature during last ten years 108°; lowest 26°2. Average rainfall for last ten years 18·15 inches. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. There has been no drought since 1887. The island may be said to be, in every way, healthy. Malarial fever used to be, to a certain extent, prevalent. Sanitary improvements and plantations of trees have, however, had a beneficial effect, and true malarial fever is now infrequent.

Population.

The population of the several districts, excluding the military, at the censuses taken in 1881 and 1891, was:

| Town       | 1891   | 1881   |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Nicosia    | 61,695 | 56,812 |
| Famagusta  | 41,423 | 38,207 |
| Larnaca    | 23,760 | 20,766 |
| Limassol   | 35,730 | 29,248 |
| Papho      | 31,674 | 28,424 |
| Kyrenia    | 15,004 | 13,216 |

Total ... 209,286 186,173

This shows an increase during the decade of 23,113.

The Moslems form about 23 per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Orthodox Greek Church.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 12,515 (11,536 in 1881) inhabitants; Larnaca, 7,593 (7,838 in 1881); Limassol, 7,388 (6,006 in 1881). The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour, and plans are now under consideration for the improvement of the harbour for commercial purposes. At present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has only 763 (658 in 1881) inhabitants, nearly all Moslems. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 2,488 (1,906 in 1881), nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Kitna, the modern capital of Papho, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, where a small harbour has been constructed, in the district of the same name on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania.

Industry.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but with the exception of a concession granted in 1886, and since abandoned, they have not been worked in recent times. A company is now, however, prospecting for copper at Lymnus. Gypsum is exported in a raw state from the Carpas, mostly to Syria, and manufactured, i.e., in the form of plaster of Paris, from Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from this place it is mostly sent to Egypt. The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, carobs, wine and spirits, cotton, linseed, aniseed, silk, cheese, wool, fruit, and vegetables; cattle, mules and donkeys are also exported.

Agriculture has been greatly retarded by want of water, the rainfall being deficient, and much of what does fall being allowed to run to waste. A scheme for storing water for irrigation is now being carried out under the superintendence of an engineer lent by the Government of India.

The carobs and cereals are exported mainly to the United Kingdom, France, and Egypt.

Cyprus wine is somewhat heavy for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it acquires from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins. This practice has for some time been discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables the wine to be conveyed in barrels.

Both wine and spirits have, since the extra duty was imposed in France, found a fairly good demand in Egypt and in other parts of the Turkish Empire.

Since the year 1880, when direct regular communication with Egypt terminated, the production of fruit and vegetables, for which the island is well adapted, has not developed, but now that direct communication has again been secured considerable progress in this industry is anticipated. The direct communication with Egypt has given a great impetus to the export of the surplus oxen, sheep, and other animals.

In past years much injury was done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with
great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, were stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts were then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as they are topped with a zinc lining, they could not emerge. This system, as the locusts are now more scattered, has been experimentally discarded in favour of a system of collecting live locusts and locust eggs.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed by the locust, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the large number of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains a comparatively large number, and partly in consequence of the forest fires that occur through the summer months.

Sponge fishing has been extensively carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek islands. By a law passed in 1890 power is given to the High Commissioner to grant exclusive privileges for fishing the coasts for sponges, but the law has not yet been taken advantage of. The value of the fishing may be put at from 20,000£., to 30,000£. a year.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected, and it is difficult to obtain fish all the year round except at the seaport towns.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, linseed, aniseed, silk, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, gypsum, and terra umbra.

The improvement of agriculture is fostered by the Government by means of the introduction of improved machines and implements. A few harvesting machines and iron oil presses are now working successfully, and a special iron plough, constructed in England, is used by several farmers. The planting of mulberry, olive, carob and other fruit trees is increasing rapidly.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order-in-Council which came into operation on the 1st August, 1882, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign, half-sovereign, Turkish lira, and French 20-franc piece. Silver, the florin, shilling, sixpence, and three-pence; limit of tender 3£. Bronze, the piastre (nine equal to one shilling), half piastre; quarter piastre, limit of tender, 27 piastres (40 paras = 1 piastre).

The Imperial Ottoman Bank has a branch established at Larnaca, and an agency at Nicosia.

There is as yet no Government savings bank.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The okra = 2½ lbs avoirdupois; and the donum = about ¼ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

There is no railway or navigable waterway in the island, but roads between all important places are now maintained. Proposals for a railway connecting certain important centres are now, however, under consideration. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration work about 240 miles of land line in connection with their cables. The island is in direct telegraphic communication with Alexandria and Latakia (Syria), by means of the cables of the Eastern and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Companies respectively.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Alexandria, and Smyrna and Constantinople by the "Messageries Maritimes." A weekly service is at present maintained with Egypt by the Austrian Lloyd's Company. There are also direct steamers to and from Egypt and the adjacent coast of Syria.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers per 2 ozs. |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Within the island ½ c.p. ¼ c.p.         |
| To U.K., India, and certain Colonies... 30 paras ½ c.p. |
| To Elsewhere... 2 c.p. ½ c.p.           |

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the island.

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of elementary schools was established in 1882.

In accordance with a law passed in 1895, Boards of Education have recently been established, one to regulate the Moslem schools and another to regulate the Christian schools. There is also in each district a District Committee for Moslem schools, and a District Committee for Greek-Christian schools, presided over in each case by the Commissioner of the district.

There are 201 elementary schools in connection with the Greek Orthodox Church, with an enrolment of 12,000, which receive aid amounting to 2,844£. And there are 77 elementary Moslem schools, with an enrolment of 3,000, which receive aid amounting to 656£.

An Armenian boys' school and an Armenian girls' school in Nicosia, a school at the Armenian Monastery near Kythrea, and a Maronite school in the village of Kornakiti are also aided by Government.

An Idadi or Moslem high school is maintained entirely by the Government at a cost of about 330£. a year; and a grant of 200£. a year is given to the Greek gymnasium at Nicosia, which provides the required training for teachers of Greek-Christian elementary schools.

There are also Greek high schools at Larnaca, Limassol and Paphos, and three endowed elementary Greek schools which are not aided by Government.

14 elementary Moslem schools are maintained entirely by a grant from Constantinople, which amounts to 200£. a year.

36 Christian and 26 Moslem elementary schools are maintained by local contributions only, without any aid from Government.

The total number of schools of all classes is 369 (118 Moslem and 251 Christian), and the total enrolment is about 17,500: 4,000 Moslems and 13,500 Christians.

Leprosy.

Prior to the British occupation, limited provision was made for lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was originally founded by the dragoman to the Turkish governor early in the century.

* Postage on letters to the U.K., India, and such other colonies and countries as joined the penny post arrangement was reduced to 30 paras per ½ oz. from the 25th of Dec., 1890. A reduced rate of postal passage to the U.K. came into effect on the 1st Jan., 1890. (See end of introduction.)
The asylum has been greatly improved, several new houses of an improved class having been erected, and the accommodation thus largely increased. The welfare of the inmates has been a matter of considerable attention, and a recreation room was provided by the liberality of a former High Commissioner, Sir H. E. Bulwer, which has greatly enhanced the comfort of these poor people.

A church has also been erected by voluntary subscriptions.

There is now accommodation for over 100 inmates, and the enclosed farm of 200 donums is partly cultivated by the lepers, the produce being all used on the farm. Each person receives bread, clothing, and fuel, and a government allowance of 24 copper pastres daily.

No leper quits the farm except on very rare occasions, and then only on urgent business and with the permission of the Chief Medical Officer.

The total number of lepers in the island, as returned by the census of 1879, was 107—76 males and 31 females. On 31st March, 1890, there were 111 inmates on the leper farm.

The disease shows itself in two principal forms, the tubercular, and the anesthetic; of the latter there is a notable sub-group, elephantiasis multilobus, in which spontaneous amputation of fingers, toes, and even whole members occurs. In the other form the skin and mucous membranes are the parts chiefly affected, especially the face and head. This form is more common, more dreadful in its effects, and more rapid in its termination; but neither of the two can be called a fatal disease as their average duration is 10-20 years, and some lepers live to be quite old people.

Leprosy is slightly more common in this island among males than females; the greater proportion of cases come from low-lying villages in the districts of Famagusta. The promulgation of the disease has been proved beyond doubt to be due to contagion, stimulated by unclean habits, bad food, and, in a way, malarial cachexy, although undoubtedly the predisposition to the disease is very often hereditary.

A law was passed in 1891 to better regulate the segregation and treatment of lepers, and a Superintendent and two guards have been appointed, who reside in the asylum, to enforce discipline and superintend the conduct of the lepers.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:

"I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkemé-i-Shérifé) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

II. That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkat) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the production of the produce of State and Crown lands * let or sold during that period.

IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arzili Miriyé vé Emliki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

On the 14th of August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to legislation has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six elective Members being office-holders, and twelve elected Members three to be chosen by the Mahommedan and nine by the non-Mahommedan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal consisting at present of two judges.

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of £5,000 a year. (Agreement of the 3rd February, 1879.)
(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members, having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment and a fine of £1.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to £1.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the Court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkémé-i-Shériféh, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadi's, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are—

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—

   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.

   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.

   (3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males between 18 and 60 years of age.

3. Tithes of the following products of the island—

   Carobs—taken in kind.

   Olives—value assessed and recovered in money.

   Carobs and silk cocoons—taken on export.

   Dues are taken on export on cotton, linseed, aniseed, raisins, wound silk, black seed ("Mavro Koko"), silk cocoons, and manufactured silk, if manufactured by others than hand looms.

   The tithes of all other articles have been abolished except in 1888 and sixteen in 1897.]

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (temporary) of ½ per cent. on those who receive certain incomes (for locust destruction). This tax is now almost suspended.

9. Import duties.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike. All other export duties, and fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

There is a police force of about 670 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its medieval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, of very ancient date, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum was started in 1889 by subscription.
