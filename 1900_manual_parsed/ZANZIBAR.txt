ZANZIBAR.

The kingdom of Zanzibar was formerly a dependency of Muscat, and became independent in 1861. The island itself, situated in 6° N. lat., is the largest coraline island on the African coast, being 47 miles long by 20 broad, and contains an area of 640 square miles. The port of the island is one of the best of Africa, and it has long been the centre of all commerce with the mainland, now included in the British and German spheres of influence. It has an excellent water supply, and some fine buildings. The climate is better than that of the mainland, the thermometer ranging from 77° to 90°, with a mean of 80°, and an annual rainfall of 60 inches. The hot season is from January to March.

On the death of the late Sultan, in August, 1896, the palace was seized by Said Khaled, a member of his family, and force had to be resorted to to compel his submission. The palace was bombarded by British warships, and Khaled took refuge in the German consulate. The present Sultan, Hamud bin Muhamad bin Said, was then installed.

The island is fertile, producing cloves, copra, and other tropical products, but its exports, gathered from the mainland, include wax, hides, rubber, ebony, orchilla weed, copal, and tortoise shell. Its imports are calico and Manchester goods, hardware, cereals, and iron and brass wire for the interior trade. The population is about 250,000, of very mixed blood, with the exception of a small upper class of pure Arabs.

Six miles to the north of Zanzibar lies the small and densely wooded but waterless Island of Umbatia, and some 30 miles further north lies the Island of Pembe, with an area of 380 miles. It is very fertile, producing cloves to the value of £20,000 a year.
