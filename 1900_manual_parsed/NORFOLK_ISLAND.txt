NEW SOUTH WALES—NEW ZEALAND

Islets being Phillip, Nepean, and Bird Islands. They comprise altogether about 12 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Capt. Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there from Botany Bay. This was removed in 1855, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 150 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population at the census of 1891 was 738. On 31st December, 1896, it was 869.

The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The island has now been placed under the government of New South Wales, and a resident magistrate has been appointed. Communication with the group is maintained by a sailing vessel once in every three months. There is a resident doctor, and an efficient school. The chief village is Kingston, on the largest island.

Resident Magistrate, Charles McArthur King.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.

Lord Howe Island is a dependency of New South Wales, about six miles long, and one mile broad. Its population in 1893 was 63 persons. It is a mountainous, well-wooded island. The land in some places is very rich, and remarkable for its equable and delightful climate. It is situated about 450 miles E. of Sydney, in 31° 30' S. lat. and 159° 25' E. long., and forms part of the Colony, being administered by a visiting magistrate from Sydney.

The islet of Ball's Pyramid lies between Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands.

Visiting Magistrate, J. A. Brodie.
