NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with all the islands within a distance of three leagues, including those of Banguey and Balembangan; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan (where are also the headquarters of the administration), and Lahat Datu and Tawau, Cowie Harbour, on the east, Kudat on the north, Gaya and Ambong on the west, and Mempakol, opposite Labuan Island. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 fro
Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. Inland stations are at Penungah, Kaningow, and Beaufort.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, &c.

The mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully investigated. Gold has been found in three of the rivers on the east coast, and the Sarawak River is now being worked by a steam dredger, the property of the British North Borneo Gold Syndicate; copper and other minerals have also been met with, but so far have not been worked. A syndicate is now prospecting for coal on the east coast.

The country is mountainous, although the shore is flat and fringed with mangrove. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 14,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 200,000, are mainly Malays, Bajows, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade; further back, the Dusuns cultivate yearly well irrigated rice fields; and, in the interior, there are many mixed tribes who plant hill padi (rice) and hunt, clearing fresh jungle every year, occasionally raising more permanent houses by head-hunting raids, on a petty scale. There are Malay and Chinese settlements on the coast, which cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. Sandakan, the chief town, has a population of 7,000. There are two missions, one the Church of England, with an interior missionary station at Kaningow, and one Roman Catholic with three stations on the West Coast. The former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community has a church and school at Sandakan, with a branch at Kudat. The club, hotels, banks and insurance agencies, European and Chinese stores, public markets, hospital, Government house, offices, gaol, barracks, saw mills, tennis grounds and the numerous neat suburban bungalows around bespeak civilization and progress in the capital.

On the west coast Kudat has also an hotel and public buildings, with agencies, stores, shops, and bungalows, which supply all the wants of the mixed community.

History.

The state and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sudakana in 1608, and soon abandoned. An English settlement was made in 1609, and abandoned 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1769 at the island of Balembangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Brunei. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Maruda Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1840, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a company, called the Labuan Training Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later purchased by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (now Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as British North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the Territory by agreement with "the State of North Borneo," dated the 21st May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 93°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is about 120 inches, chiefly from November to February.

Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive stage, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. The chief products are tobacco, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, and pineapple fibre. There is still a large trade in the collection of jungle produce; but during the past year much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco. The soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited for its growth; about 1,000,000 acres have been leased on 999 years leases, or applied for, chiefly for this purpose, and ten estates are in full operation. The rapid development of this industry is shown by the following figures as to exports of tobacco since 1887:—1887, 30,800 lbs.; 1888, 81,664 lbs.; 1889, 168,112 lbs.; 1890, 408,275 lbs.; 1891, 1,635,744 lbs.; 1892, 1,780,173 lbs.; 1893, 1,378,122 lbs.; 1894, 1,411,575 lbs.; 1895, 1,370,370 lbs.; 1896, 2,063,680 lbs.; 1897, 1,789,290 lbs.

In 1898 the value of exported tobacco reached $358,666, or 67,933/.

Ramo fibre claims one plantation, and there is oil boring by the Burmah Bombay Training Company on the West Coast.

The exports comprise also, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, pine-apple fibre, gutta percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds nests, camphor, resin (called damar), gold, cattle, cutch, &c., on which a royalty of 10 per cent. ad valorem, and 1 cent. per lb. on estate grown tobacco, sent almost entirely to Singapore, China, and Australia; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

A timber trade has been opened with both Australia and China.

The Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import duties, stamps, and royalties on the various exports, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites. Besides the tobacco estates already mentioned eight general plantations-
have been opened by Europeans, especially the Dutch, and the demand for land has been so great as to cause the price to be raised from $3 to $10 per acre. Pepper and sago are exported from the West Coast. Six timber companies are engaged in the timber trade, and two saw mill companies are at work carrying on a large export trade with England, China, Manilla, and other ports.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $180,000. American, Mexican, Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, and British dollars are treated as currency. There are agencies of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, and the National Bank of China, and the Company itself does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a court of directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor, Treasurer-General, and Residents appointed by them. There are 9 provinces (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, and Myburgh).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British colonies, and an Emaum's court, for the administration of Mahommadan law, with native courts for trials by local customs. There is a force of about 450 armed police under European officers. An European medical officer is attached to each Residency.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Holt run steamers constantly between Singapore and the local ports, and between Hong Kong and the ports. There is frequent communication by steamer with Singapore and Hong Kong, and occasional visits are made by steamers running between Hong Kong and Australia, and a local company runs a line along the coast and to adjacent islands. The Government are constructing a metre-gauge railway from Brunei Bay to Sapong, and 25 miles have already been laid. The distance to the interior at Sapong is 52 miles. The line will be extended to Cowie Harbour and Gaya Bay. Several riding roads already exist, and more are in course of construction. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the postal union. Course of post from London, about thirty days. Postage from Sandakan to all places outside the territory, for letters 10 cents per ½ oz.

The postal business has considerably increased during the last few years. Statistics for 1893-98 are as follows:

On the completion of the Singapore—Labuan—Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Menumbok, which has since been joined with Mempakol by telegraph. A telegraph line from that point to Sandakan is now constructed, and brings the intermediate stations of Mempakol, Weston Beaufort, Rajah, Sapong, Kantingow and Penungah into direct telegraphic communication with London.

A branch line from Beaufort, on the Padas River, to Ambong, on the west coast, is under construction, and a line from Lamag, on the Kinabatangan River, to the Gold Fields, on the Segama River has been ordered.
