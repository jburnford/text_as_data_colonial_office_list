LABUAN.

(See Map of British North Borneo.)

The island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30-23 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about thirty miles; and from Singapore 722 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

The island, then uninhabited was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846 an occupied in 1848.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island. Hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success, but in 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who have since transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. The mines are now progressing more favourably, and a railway of 10½ miles in length between the mines and the wharf at Port Victoria has been completed and is connected with another line leading to side workings.

The Company has completed several buildings both in Victoria and at Coal Point, and possesses a steam collier of 1,500 tons, which carries coal to Manila and Singapore.

Export of Labuan Coal.

| Year | Tons |
|------|------|
| 1896 | 52,071 |
| 1897 | 43,891 |
| 1898 | 46,770 |

The output will be increased next year, as stronger machinery for pumping has been ordered.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the new jetty, and vessels drawing 15 alongside the old jetties to coal.

Plans for the construction of a stone pier, to allow of coal wagons being directly discharged into ships, are being discussed by the Coal Company.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton from pipes alongside the piers, and H.M. ships with coal, by agreement, at 15s. per ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, pearls, tortoise-shell, and trepang, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated as under cultivation.

There are four sago manufactories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore. There is no bank or savings bank. The currency is Mexican dollars and copper cents.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Borneo, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

A school and two hospitals are aided by Government grants, but there are no Government schools, and education is not compulsory.

The Government is administered by a Governor, who, under the Letters Patent of 6th November, 1889, alone makes ordinances, there being no legislative council.

Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant in aid, but since then the Colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony, which in turn is being replaced by armed constabulary from British North Borneo. At the end of 1889 it was arranged that the Governor of the territory of the British North Borneo Company should be appointed Governor of Labuan.

A railway has been made 2-feet 5-inch gauge, and of about 8 miles in length, from Victoria Harbour to the coal mines at Coal Point, where it will join the existing line which connects the mines with the wharf at Coal Point. The railway is the property of the Labuan & Borneo Company, Ltd.

The Labuan Water Company was started in 1883, and, with two miles of piping, supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with potable water. A yearly dividend of 7 per cent. is paid.

The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has connected Singapore, Borneo and Hong Kong by cable via Labuan. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

Steiners go about once in ten days to Singapore, and also to North Borneo and Sulu. The Sarawak Government steamer runs about once a fortnight between Kuching and Labuan. Most of the vessels calling at Labuan are engaged in the North Borneo trade, and ply regularly between the ports of that State, Singapore, and Hong Kong, making Labuan a port of call. 109 vessels
called for bunker and cargo coal during the year, on their way to and from northern ports of China, Siberia, and the Philippines. With the latter islands a steady and increasing business in Labuan coal is done.

An excellent rifle range of 1,000 yards affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are cheaply supplied by a Navy contractor. The Colony has joined the Postal Union, and the Imperial Penny Post.*
