QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the Colony.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the Colony of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,838,080 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was however never thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from Nov. to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the 21st parallel of south latitude, and thence west to the western boundary. Another range branches from the main range about lat. 21° south and long. 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.
Sugar growing has now become a very important industry. In 1898 there were 111,012 acres under cane, of which 82,891 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 163,734 tons of sugar.

Maize was grown on 109,835 acres, and returned a yield of 2,252,481 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1898, 547 acres yielded 302,960 lbs. of cured leaf. Manufactured in the colony during the year, 492,884 lbs.; cigars, 938 lbs.; cigarettes, 15,175 lbs.

In 1898 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 435 acres, which yielded 6,116 tons of tuber, and 875,640 lbs. of manufactured arrowroot were made from a portion of this at the factories. A considerable portion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains, the rainfall is tolerably regular, most of the land being under cultivation or cultivation. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba, Warwick, on the Darling Downs at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. In 1898, out of the total area planted, 2,684 acres were sown for hay, and 46,219 acres yielded 607,012 bushels of grain. 1,416 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the Colony, and there are 2,503 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 371,251 sq. miles, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

The chief exports are: Wool, 86,814,139 lbs., valued at £3,018,098; gold, 2,855,781l.; sugar, 1,329,876l.; live stock, 808,818l.; tin, 31,871l.; silver, 49,825l.; meat, 942,570l.; meat extract, 216,640l.; hides and skins, 466,265l.; tallow, 328,531l.; green fruit, 96,313l.; copper, 6,490l.; butter, 37,586l.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour hardware, and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australian colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important ones in the Colony, and gives employment to over 25,000 men. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—The Rockhampton district which includes the famous Mt. Morgan mine, Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in twenty-four districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total quantity of gold exported during 1898 amounted to 944,906 ozs. The Herberton district is the headquarters of the silver, tin, and copper mining industries, but the districts of Cooktown, Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, and Selkirk also contribute largely to the output of the baser metals, amongst which also should be mentioned bismuth, antimony, wolfram, and quicksilver. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the colony. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burram and Peak Downs, besides these its numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1898 was 407,934 tons, valued at £10,493l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbutt, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood,* &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Astelia chathamica, the bark of which yields tanin; Euphorbia procumbens, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and other fevers; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthmatic herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the Eucalyptus is coming largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1898, 240 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 23,018.

Water Supply.

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the Colony, of which a large portion has been repaid leaving at the end of 1898 an indebtedness to the Government of £78,611.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,497 square miles comprising the greater part of the colony. At least 644 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from a maximum of 4,960 feet, the depth of the bore at Bimberah Run; 379 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 200,000,000 of gallons per diem. Generally stated the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 245 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 196° to 70° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at nearly three-quarters of a million sterling exclusive of the cost of casings which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000l., so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amount expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water con-

* Beech and yellow wood are hard wood timbers.
Irrigation has made a start in the colony and already about 7,402 acres are artificially watered by some 181 irrigationists. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51.20 per cent. in 5 years, and the census of 5th April, 1891, shows the population to be about 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,919 females; Chinese about 8,574, Polynesians about 9,428, and other Asiatic races about 1,832. The balance of the population are mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. This does not include aborigines, of whom there are believed to be about 30,000 in the Colony.

There are above 250 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 36 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 198,000. The receipts of the local authorities, including Divisional Boards, in 1898 were 600,453l.; their expenditure 626,431l.; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control 42,537,070l., and debt 1,704,442l. Debts for water works, amounting to 788,611l., which are due principally from these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the colony, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had at the end of 1898 an estimated population of 107,840 (five-mile radius), and 118,193 (ten-mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast, and the climate during the greater part of the year is healthy and enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (11,520), Ipswich (7,625), Maryborough (10,000), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (19,650), Gympie (12,000), and Toowoomba (12,000).

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1898, 11 banks, with 164 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as 1,826,632l.; deposits 12,166,842l. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 68,126; the amount of deposits as 2,807,705l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

On the 31st December, 1898, the railways in Queensland showed 2,742 miles in operation, the cost of construction being 18,455,317l., besides 90,814l. expended on lines in course of progress, the revenue 1,263,153l., and the working expenses 728,161l. The following lines are now open for traffic:

THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN from Brisbane to Cunnamulla; with its branches, Ipswich to Dugandan, Brisbane Valley Junction to Esk, Gowrie Junction via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crows Nest, Wyreema to Pittsworth, Hendon to Allora, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to Norang, with branches to Beandesert, Southport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Gladstone, with branches to Enoggera, Pinkenba, Sandgate, Degilbo, Kilkivan, Pialba, Cordalba, and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre.

THE CENTRAL RAILWAY is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches to Moun-Morgan, Springsure and Clermont; also one to Broadmount and to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 23 miles of railway are open to Mirani, with a branch to Eton opening up good agricultural land.

THE ROWEN RAILWAY is also open from that port to Wangaratta, a distance of 48 miles.

THE NORTHERN RAILWAY is open from Townsville to Winton, with a branch to Ravenswood, having been carried past Charters Towers, the latter town a great gold-mining centre, having a population of over 10,000 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the head of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook and Carpentaria Division a railway is being constructed to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 67 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also in course of construction from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Herberton, the great tin-mining centre, which is now open for traffic to Marcelba, a distance of 46 miles. A private line is also being constructed to Chillagoe, tapping a large area rich in minerals. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, south-easterly.

There are 422 electric telegraph stations in the colony. The number of miles of line 10,088, with 18,565 miles of wire. The receipts were 79,831l.

The number of messages during 1898 was 1,334,846. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 1,516 subscribers who use it, and cables containing multiple wires are now being laid under ground to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street, and to secure a metallic circuit.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks; with supplementary steamers occasionally; via Brindisi and Melbourne every week; via San Francisco and Sydney every four weeks; via Vancouver every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi and Torres Straits is forty nine days. There is daily communication with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia. The rates of postage are:

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vic. No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1898 there were in operation 848 schools, with an enrolment of 99,097 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 171 private schools, with 12,292 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 871 pupils, on the roll in Dec., 1898. A University is about to be established. There are no local rates for education, which is paid for by the whole colony.

Defence.

The land defence force of Queensland is organized under the Defence Acts, 1884 to 1896, and consists of:—1. Permanent artillery; 2. Militia; 3. Volunteers; 4. Cadets; 5. Rifle clubs. The Militia includes field and garrison artillery, mounted infantry, submarine miners, infantry, and army medical corps. The volunteers are all rifle corps. The rifle clubs take the oath of allegiance only; in time of peace the organization is subject to rules adopted by the respective clubs. Under these Acts all male inhabitants of Queensland, between the ages of eighteen and sixty years, and who are British subjects, and are not specially exempted, are, in case of war or invasion, or imminent danger of either, liable to be called on for service in the force, the necessary number of men being obtained by ballot. Persons who have been selected by ballot to serve may secure exemption by providing a suitable substitute. The period of service is three years and, in time of peace, corps are recruited by voluntary enlistment only. All members of the force are subject to the provisions of the Army Act when in uniform.

Pay.

A gunner of the permanent force is paid at the rate of 2s. 3d. per diem, in addition to free rations of bread, meat, and groceries; free kit on joining; uniform, barracks accommodation, fuel and light, and medical attendance. Special rates of working pay are given, as also 5l. bonus, on re-engagement for 3 years. Married men, to the extent of 5 per cent. of the establishment, draw lodging allowance at the rate of 1s. per diem. Good-conduct-badges, with pay at the rate of twopence per day for each badge, are awarded to non-commissioned officers under the rank of sergeant, and to men under the following conditions:—

Qualifying length of service—
After 3 years' service . . . 1 badge.

Each member of a mounted corps draws horse allowance at the rate of 3l. per annum; also 5s. per annum in lieu of bridle; and 10s. per annum in lieu of saddle. The man provides both horse and horse furniture.

Training.

Classes of instruction for officers and non-commissioned officers are formed twice during the year for periods of one month for each course. Special classes are also formed in addition as required. Recruit squads are formed in connection with the different corps when required. Instruction is afforded by instructors of the permanent staff attached to the respective corps, and when the squads have performed forty drills and parades, including a course of musketry, they are inspected by a staff officer, and if efficient, are passed into the ranks as trained men. All corps are inspected annually by the Commandant. Staff officers of the respective arms visit outlying districts periodically, attend parades and drills of corps, and afford instruction and give lectures on special subjects. The force is called out annually for continuous training for a period not exceeding eight days. Officers provide their own arms, accoutrements, and uniforms.

The police are liable for service in case of emergency.

The force is commanded by an officer, who is styled the "Commandant of the Queensland Defence Force," and this position is now occupied by Colonel H. Finn. Every officer, except officers of the regular army, receives, in the first instance, a provisional appointment, and obtains a commission as lieutenant, after passing an examination conducted by a Board of Examiners appointed by the Governor for the purpose. Examinations are conducted in May and November each year.

The marine defence force of Queensland, organized under the Defence Acts, 1881-1896, consists of:—1. Permanent force; 2. Naval brigades (militia); 3. Naval volunteer cadets corps. The main provisions of the Acts have already been stated. When in uniform all members of the force are subject to the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act.

Pay.

A seaman of the permanent force is paid at the rate of 6l. per month, in addition to a ration allowance of 1s. 4d. per diem, free kit on joining, and medical attendance. Petty officers receive a higher monthly rate, according to rank and position. The rate of pay of the militia is as follows:

The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. Every man of 21 years, who has resided six months in some electorate or electorates is entitled to be registered.

ST. HELENA.

Situation, Area, etc.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles west of the Cape of Good Hope, from the coast of Africa, in 5° 32' S. lat., and 12° 56' W. long., about 100 miles long and 10 miles broad, covering an area of 47 square miles. It is 1000 miles from South America, 1000 miles from Africa, and 2000 miles from Europe. The usual mail passage is from England, 17 days.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the north-west side, with a population of about 2000. The climate is very healthy, the rainfall between 68" and 72" per annum. The soil is very fertile, the average death-rate for the three years ending March 31, 1900, was 10.00%, including sickness landed in the island during the year.

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was visited by Columbus in 1498, and by Jean de Nova Corrala, A.D. 1502. Edmund's Bay, May 24th, 1502. The Portuguese continued to keep
secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1688, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. The Dutch held it from 1645 to 1650, when they abandoned it. It was taken possession of by the East India Company in 1651, and a charter for its administration was granted in 1661. In 1665 it was seized by the Dutch, who were, however, expelled the same year. Again, in January, 1673, they seized it, to be driven out finally in May, by Captain Munden, of the English Navy. A new charter was issued by Charles II. to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1824, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.

The Government maintain 4 schools, having 359 scholars. There are also 7 endowed and private day schools, one of which is aided by Government, having 387 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 4 of 1874, and fees of 1d. a week are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1897 were £636.1. and £504.

Industry.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818, a law was passed that all future children born in the Island should be free.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre. The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost the yield was only about three tons of fibre. Hundreds of acres of flax are now going to waste. There is, however, said to be a field for capital in the preparation of the fibre from the *Furcraea gigantea*, a tree which grows wild all over the island. Its trade depends exclusively upon the intercourse and the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress, and has greatly diminished in recent years in consequence of the opening of the telegraph cable.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war, was in 1885, 450; in 1886, 377; in 1887, 317; in 1888, 330; in 1889, 288; in 1890, 211; in 1891, 211; in 1892, 223; in 1893, 199; in 1894, 195; in 1895, 203; 1896, 151; 1897, 147; 1898, 147. It is a port of registry.

The chief industries are fishing and agriculture, the main arable crop being potatoes.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1898—£17,008), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at from ¼ to 1 per cent.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England at regular intervals of 4 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal; steamers arrive from thence at the same interval, and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 10 days. The rate of postage to the U.K., India, and certain Colonies* is 1d. per ½ oz.; to other parts of the world 2½d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post, but there are 3½ miles of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 700l. The revenues in 1898 were 93l., and the expenses 211l. The net postal revenue in 1898 was 259l., and the expenditure 349l. The new cable from the Cape reached St. Helena at the end of 1899, and was carried forward to Ascension by February, 1900. It is now being completed to St. Vincent.

Defence.

Jamestown has been made a second-class imperial coaling station, and extensive defensive works have been constructed on the heights overlooking the harbour.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of Her Majesty in Council.
