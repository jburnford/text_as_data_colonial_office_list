CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.
The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory on the south-western extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, and on the north-east by the Orange Free State and Natal. The Cape Colony, with the Transvaal, contains an area of 273,151 square miles, being over five times that of England. It extends from 26 to 35° S. lat., and from 17 to 90 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands—Agulha Pequena, on the coast of Demerara (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatrios, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876 three large tracts of Kafraria, namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Nomans Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government and on the 1st of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walfish Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the colony by proclamation dated 7th Aug., 1884.

On the 12th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was annexed to the Cape Colony. Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tamboekieland, Bomvanaland, and Geelveldland, of which by royal proclamation dated the 14th November, 1881, the Governor administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed governor. By Proclamation No. 140 of 25th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1887, in respect to the St. Francis River Territories, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 45 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xosibe country ("Mount Ayiff") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rede Valley ("Pondoland") by Letters Patent of the 2nd July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1891 the whole of Pondoland was annexed, Basutoland, now an independent colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuana land was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.
On 14th September, 1486, Bartolomeu de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay, Vasco de Gama having landed the same year later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Sandwich Bay, claimed possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain, but no settlement was made. In 1648 a Dutch East India man, the "Haarlem," was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeek, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 men, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants who had deserted France and set themselves in any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of
colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1748, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1793, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British Force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig.

An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III, c. 11) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted.

An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonization as a barrier against the Kaffir raids, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of £50,000 to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban.

On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonization of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:

1. General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in regard to slavery, and the Natal question.

2. Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war.

3. Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned.

In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed of selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in widespread starvation.

The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice are unknown except in the more elevated localities. The mean temperature at Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is—maximum 71°2, minimum 58°2, and average rainfall for last 10 years 28-56 inches. Alibar N. (4,330 ft. above sea), shows 73°8 and 44°0 max. and min. resp., rainfall average for 10 years 24-78 inches.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (Nov. to Apr.), in the Western districts during the winter months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Railways.

The railways of the Colony consisted originally of three separate systems, the Western, Midland, and Eastern, having their starting points on the seaboard at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London respectively. The Western and Midland systems are connected by a junction at De Aar (500 miles from Capetown and 339 from Port Elizabeth), and carried forward thence as one trunk line to Kimberley, the centre of the Diamond Fields (647 miles from Capetown and 486 from Port Elizabeth). This line was opened in 1885. From Kimberley the line is now carried northward to Bulawayo, in Rhodesia; a further northward extension, towards Zambesi, is in progress. The extension from Colesberg, on the Midland system, to Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State (144 miles), was opened for traffic to Bloemfontein in December, 1890. Since that date the line has been carried through the Free State, over the Vaal River into the Transvaal territory.

There is now a direct railway communication from the railways of the Cape Colony to Durban, Natal, and Lorenzo Marquez (Delagoa Bay), as well as to various important centres in the Transvaal. The line, 334 miles long, through the Free State to the Vaal River, was taken over by the Free State on the 1st January, 1897, in terms of the Convention under which the construction was arranged. The Eastern system extends from East London, through Queen's Town, to Alibar North, adjacent to the Basutoland and Orange Free State frontiers; it was opened in 1885, and in May, 1892, it was extended to join the railway within the Free State at Springfontein, so forming a direct line to Bloemfontein and Johannesburg. In the same year, 1892, a connecting line, 83 miles long, from Rosemead Junction, on the Midland line, to Stormberg Junction, on the Eastern line, was opened. Besides these main lines, there are branch lines to Simon's Town (20 miles), Malmesbury (30 miles), now being extended to Pickener's Kloof, a distance of 96 miles from Malmesbury, and Sir Lowry's Pass (14 miles), now being extended to Caledon, 53 miles from Sir Lowry's
Pass, on the Western system; a loop line from Port Elizabeth to Middelburg, via Graaff Reinet (283 miles) and a branch to Grahamstown (35 miles) on the Midland; and to King William's Town (10 miles) on the Eastern. A line is being constructed by the Government from Queenstown, on the Eastern system, to Tarkastad, a distance of 31 miles.

The lengths from Cape Town to Wellington, 45 miles, and from Cape Town to Wynberg, 8 miles, became the property of the Government by purchase; the rest have been constructed, equipped, and maintained at the expense of the general revenue.

The Government mileage open for traffic in December, 1898, was 1,990 miles, the capital expended on purchase, construction, and equipment to that date being 20,222,263L. The gross receipts for 1898 were 2,953,090L, compared with 3,070,897L in 1897; the working expenses were 2,012,390L, compared with 1,898,316L in 1897, resulting in a return of 4L, 13s. 11d. per cent. on capital expended.

The line known as the Kowie Line, between Grahamstown and Port Alfred (about 43 miles), which was constructed by a company subsidised by Government, was opened for traffic in 1883. During the session of 1883 powers were given to a company, to be aided by a subsidy, to construct a branch from Worcester, on the Western Main Line, down the Breede River Valley as far as Montagu. This line has been continued to Swellendam, a total distance of 83 miles.

During the session of 1895 the Colonial Legislature authorised the construction of the following lines by private enterprise, the Government subsidising the Companies, Concessionnaires, or Contractors building the lines, viz.:

(1) A line of railway from Mossel Bay, via George, Oudtshoorn, and Willowmore, to a point on the Graaff Reinet Railway, at or near Klipplaat;
(2) A line of railway from a point at or near Somerset East, via Cookhouse and Bedford, to Fort Beaufort;
(3) A line of railway from Fort Beaufort, via Alice, to King William's Town;

These lines are under construction.

It was further decided that the Government should construct, equip, and work the lines from Oudtshoorn, via Willowmore, to a point on the Cape Government Railways at or near Klipplaat, in the event of the same not being undertaken by private enterprise, on the terms offered by Government, and this is actually being done by agreement with the concessionnaire.

The Cape Copper Mining Company own and work a mineral line from Port Nolloth to Oukopie (92 miles), in the north-western part of the Colony, built at a cost of 158,000L. In September, 1892, a line of railway 32 miles long was opened for passenger traffic between Cape Town and Sea Point; it belongs to a private company. In the same year a private line of 7 miles in length was opened, connecting the Zwartkop Salt Pan with the Midland (Government) Railway System. In March, 1896, the Indwe Line (66 miles long) connecting the Eastern System with the Indwe coal mine, was opened. It was built by a private company, aided by a Government subsidy, at a cost of 158,000L.

Total railways open 30th June, 1899: (a) belonging to and worked by Government, 1,990 miles; (b) owned by private companies, but worked by Government, 653 miles; (c) lines owned and worked by private companies, 224 miles; total, 2,867 miles. There were 219 miles under construction for private companies on 30th June, 1899.

The gauge of the Cape Government Railways and of the lines connected therewith is 3 ft. 6 in.; a departure from this standard has, however, now been sanctioned by the Colonial Parliament; a line of 2 ft. gauge is being surveyed in detail between Port Elizabeth, Humansdorp and Avontuur, a distance of 180 miles, and tenders for its construction will shortly be invited.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale are being constructed at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London, under the direction of local boards, composed of elective and nominee members.

The expenditure upon construction of works at Table Bay to the 31st December, 1898, has been 2,623,928L, and the annual charges for interest and maintenance, including working, are respectively about 56,150L and 80,000L.

Extensive additions to the shipping accommodation have been authorised and are in course of construction, comprising an outer harbour formed in part by the breakwater, and a south arm running parallel with it, which will enclose an area of 64 acres, in addition to the inner docks, or a total area, when the works are completed, of about 75 acres, with a depth ranging from 24 to 36 feet at low water.

The breakwater is completed to a length of 3,610 feet, and is being extended by 1,050 feet.

The graving dock is 500 feet on the keel blocks, with a depth of 21½ feet over the sill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T.

The patent slip is capable of taking up vessels of 1,000 tons.

The works constructed at Port Elizabeth were two iron pile jetties, 1,152 and 810 feet long respectively, which have much facilitated the landing and shipping of passengers and goods; an iron bridge over the Baakens River, and two retaining banks, and the removal of the old wooden jetties, and the old breakwater and shield. The net expenditure from 1st Jan., 1878 to the 30th June, 1893 was 320,625L. The work of extending the north jetty, at a cost of 100,000L, is completed. Provision was made in 1896 for lengthening and widening the south jetty, and for the construction of a third jetty, and for other increased facilities.

The administration of the harbour is in the hands of a board of seven members, two elected by residents paying 10L a year wharfage, one nominated by the Chamber of Commerce, three by the Government, and the Mayor being a member ex officio.

At East London, at the mouth of the Buffalo River, successful harbour works have been carried out, overcoming the obstructions of sand-bars, which, previously to a great extent closed the mouth of the river. The entrance to the river is now protected and sheltered by a solid south breakwater and improved by means of two training walls. The depth of water about the entrance is maintained by two steam pump hopper dredgers of the latest type. A least depth of water over the bar of about 18 feet at low water ordinary spring tides is available throughout the year. The width between ends at entrance to river is 600 feet. Steamers of over 6,000 tons gross register now enter the river and discharge cargo alongside wharves. The harbour is well equipped with steam cranes, and possesses a patent slip capable of accommodating vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight. To the 30th June, 1899, there had been
expended at East London for harbour works and interest on loans £1,046,643.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin. Nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the Mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The River Diggings extend along the Vaal River, principally on the right bank from above Hebron to its junction with the Hart at Delport's Hope. The Dry Mines at present worked are at Kimberley, De Beer's, De Wett's Pan, Bullifstein, Premier Mine (Wesselton), Kanter's Dam, Otto's Kopje, the Leicester Mine, Smith's Prospect Mine, Otto's Prospect Mine, and the abandoned mines, Newlands Nos. I and II, St. Augustine's Mine also figures to a small extent in the production returns. The alluvial diggings at present worked commence at Fourteen Streams, extending principally on the north bank of Vaal River to Delport's Hope, in the Division of Barkly West, and opposite Hebron, and on the south bank lie the Wedburg Kopje and the Robinson Diggings, in the Division of Kimberley, also on the south bank, below the village of Barkly, and in the Division of Barkly West, lie the Waldeck Plant Diggings and Niekerk Rush.

The following tables give the total quantity and value of the production and export of Diamonds during the past five years:

| Year | Production |
|------|------------|
|      | Carats.    |
| 1894 | 2,809,078  |
| 1895 | 3,105,131  |
| 1896 | 3,212,392  |
| 1897 | 3,052,630  |

Cape coal from various mines situated in the Stormberg is extensively used upon the Cape Government railways, with good results both as regards the working of the lines and the development of an industry the importance of which to the Colony cannot be overrated. The supplies of steam coal to the Railway Department from mines in Cape Colony, for which contracts were entered into for the year 1898, are as follows: 1,834 tons monthly from the Cape Collieries, 1,200 tons monthly from Cyphergat, 1,000 tons monthly from Fairview, and 3,000 tons monthly from Indwe. The Eastern system of railways draws its coal supply principally from mines in the Colony; Cape coal is also largely used on the Midland system and to some extent on the Western.

During the year 1897 a series of thorough comparative tests was made by the Railway Department of all coals (Welsh, Cape Colonial, Orange Free State and Transvaal) used by the Cape Locomotive Department. Of the mines which supplied the different samples of coal thus tested twelve are situated in Cape Colony. The trials were carried out on the Eastern system of railways between East London and Queenstown. The results obtained showed that the value of a given quantity of the best Cape coal, for use in locomotive or stationary engines, was, roughly speaking, about two-thirds that of an equal quantity of imported Ocean Methylr coal. Among the best Colonial coals for making steam are those from the following mines: Contats, Penshaw, Fairview (new mine), Indwe, Cape Collieries, and "Wallsend." The Indwe coal possesses the advantage, as regards its use in locomotives, of containing little or no sulphur. The Cyphergat and the Molteno coals are highly bituminous, and the latter has a deservedly high reputation as house coal, but is not so suitable for locomotives as coal of a semi-anthracite nature, like "Wallsend."

The Indwe mine, which is situated in the division of Wodehouse, is connected with the Government railways by a private line joining the Eastern system at Sterkstroom. All the other mines in the Colony are served by the Eastern system, except Contats, which is on the Midland. The total output from the Colonial mines during the year 1898 is returned at 191,858 tons. The coal areas in the Colony are of considerable extent, and there is every reason to hope that, with increased facilities in mining and transport, the output will steadily improve in quantity and quality.

In the neighbourhood of the Indwe, trending in a north-east direction, are considerable tracts of Crown land as yet untested, but reported by mining and geological experts to be in all probability the seat of valuable deposits of coal. It has been suggested that these beds may be connected with those found on the north-west border of Natal.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist. Much activity has been displayed in this direction during the last year, owing to the increased demand for copper in manufactures.

The output from the mines during 1898 was 36,822 tons of ore, the quantity exported being 24,808 tons, valued at £262,830.

A geological survey of the Colony was begun in January, 1896. The field work has been carried on continuously during the past four years, and the area now mapped includes all the districts...
south of the Zwartebergen, eastwards as far as a line from George to Oudshoorn. The greater portion of this area was shown on a map published with the report of the survey for 1897.

This area so far surveyed consists of the following formations given in ascending sequence:

1. Malmesbury Beds with intrusions of granite and diabase.
2. Table Mountain Sandstone.
3. Bokkeveld Beds.
4. Witteberg Quartzites.
5. Dwyka Conglomerates.
6. Eccra Beds.

Guano is found on the various islets along the coast; the industry is under Government control. The quantity collected for the season of 1898 was 5,490 tons.

Industries.

The chief industries are the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of the Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked. Those reserved to the Crown cover an estimated area of about 250,000 acres. They are controlled by the Department of Agriculture, at an annual charge of some £22,000.

The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests with anticipated satisfactory results. The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, gold, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are textiles, leather, sugar, coffee, hardware, explosives, and machinery.

The wine (Colonial produce) exported in 1898 amounted to 60,331 gallons, valued at 15,043£.

Ostrich breeding is not now carried on so largely as heretofore. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in many districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1898 it amounted to 369,778 lbs., valued at 748,565£.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively—385 lbs., 403,158 lbs., and 10,876,011 lbs., valued at 647,548£. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871, and stood at 73,732,926 lbs. in 1898, valued at 1,766,740£.

The Agricultural Department, which was established in 1887, has, by the consent of Parliament, been placed under a separate Minister. Amongst the more important works of the past few years have been the reconstitution of the phylloxerised vineyards by means of the French-American resistant stocks, the improvement in the Hackney breed of horses, and the establishment of a Bacteriological Laboratory for investigating diseases of animals, and for ensuring the supply of calf lymph for purposes of vaccination. The Laboratory is now under the administration and control of the Health Branch of the Colonial Secretary's office. The Agricultural Department deals with all matters connected with diseases of plants, viticulture, fruit culture, preparation of raisins and dried fruits, poultry farming, horticulture, and pisciculture. A general Scab Act, passed during the session 1894, came into force in November, 1895, and repealed the existing permissive Acts. The invasion of rinderpest into South Africa involved special measures, first for its check on the Colonial border, and subsequently for the inoculation of animals upon lines laid down by scientists who specially studied the subject in the Transvaal, Natal, and Cape Colony, and special legislation was promulgated and administered to that end. Owing to the discoveries of Dr. Koch, who was engaged by the Government to investigate a cure, the disease has been stamped out, and it is confidently hoped that any sporadic outbreak will be similarly dealt with.

The Fishery and Game Laws are also administered by the department, and in connection with the former a properly equipped steam trawler, the "Pieter Faure," has been imported with a view to opening up the Fishing Industry of the Colony. The preliminary work has been extended to Saldanha Bay, Mossel Bay, the L'Agulhas Bank, and portions of the south-east coast, and has been of a most satisfactory nature, the trials made having proved that large quantities of fish are easily procurable by trawling. The trout acclimatization work is still being carried on with a most gratifying measure of success, and an attempt is also being made to introduce salmon into Colonial waters.

Capetown, East London, and Port Elizabeth are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1898, 55 vessels registered, of together 4,513 tons.

The following return, supplied by establishments producing manufactures of the value of 100£ or upwards per annum, showed the value and importance of the various industries of the Colony in 1890:

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account.

Since the beginning of 1892, the banks having their head offices outside the colony are only allowed to issue notes supplied to them by the government, which holds securities deposited by the institutions for the total supply of such notes given to the banks. The notes are legal tender and guaranteed by the government, the banks
having to redeem the notes in gold on demand at their chief places of business.

Banks having their head office in the colony, and having been registered on the 1st January, 1891, can continue to issue their own notes, which are neither guaranteed nor legal tender.

There are 5 banks with 96 branches.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (68 branches), the Bank of Africa, Limited (11 branches), the African Banking Corporation, Limited (16 branches), the Stellenbosch District Bank, Limited, and the National Bank, S.A., Rep. (2 branches).

The total amount of notes in circulation on the 30th of June, 1899, was 925,800L; legal tender, 918,170L; other, 7,630L.

Education.

Under the Education Act, No. 13 of 1865, and the Higher Education Act, No. 24 of 1874, the department administers parliamentary grants to colleges, and to the following classes of schools, viz.:—Undenominational public, district boarding, evening, private farm, poor, mission aborigines' institutions, art schools, training schools for teachers, and industrial schools for poor whites, for the following purposes, viz.: part payment of salaries, purchase of buildings, furniture, apparatus, and books; training of teachers; support of indigent boarders.

Schools are managed and teachers appointed, subject to the control of the department, by local committees or managers nominated by the voluntary promoters and supporters of the schools, or by divisional or municipal councils acting as such managers.

The Government grants are, generally speaking, given to supplement local contributions of at least equal amount. There is no school tax, the necessary grants being provided from the general revenue. The department further undertakes the periodical inspection of schools, collects and publishes educational statistics, and issues certificates of professional competency to teachers.

The Government expenditure on schools in 1897-98 was 235,022L. 14s. 7d. On the 30th of June, 1899, there were in operation seven colleges with 658 students and 2,650 schools of various classes, with an enrolment of 142,437, and an average attendance of 108,972.

The University.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

Under Act No. 6 of 1896 the University is empowered to confer the following additional degrees.—Lit.D., B.Sc., M.Sc., D.Sci., Bachelor of Music, Master of Music, Doctor of Music.

The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowment, &c. The Council consists of 33 members.

In 1891 the number of students who matriculated was 142, 35 passed the intermediate examination, and 16 took direct degrees. In 1892 the numbers were 207, 40, and 19; in 1893, 214, 40, and 24; in 1894, 214, 37, and 28; in 1895, 242, 43, and 25; in 1896, 250, 59, and 25; in 1897, 372, 77, and 26; in 1898, 354, 85, and 40; in 1899, 440, 109, and 35 respectively.

In connection with the University, school examinations are held annually. 18,592 candidates have passed the elementary, and 5,365 the higher examination during the years 1875-1899.

Sea and Land Communications.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Cape Town, by the Western cable, and via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable. The telegraph system is well developed, there being now 21,760 miles of telegraph wire, and 1,299 miles of telephone wire open, erected by the Government at a cost of £22,306l.; the gross earnings in 1897 being 285,213l., and the expenditure 132,586l.

The packets of the Union Steamship Company and the Castle Mail Packets Company, under contracts with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 19 days, and in 19½ days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena. The average passage is under 18 days on the outward voyage, and under 17 on the homeward. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. Up to the 20th June, 1891, the mail packets called at Lisbon on outward voyages to take up the supplementary English and the Continental mails; but after that date it was arranged that they should call at Madeira only on the direct outward voyage. The St. Helena-Ascension service is performed by the intermediate steamers of the two companies. The mail packets call at Madeira on the homeward voyages.

The Castle steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London, to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay is also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Castle and Union Companies.

A mail train leaves Cape Town daily at 9 p.m. for the Orange Free State, South African Republic, Natal, Bechuanaland, and Rhodesia, in addition to which mails are despatched to the principal places connected with the railway in the Cape Colony, Orange Free State, and South African Republic three times a week by trains leaving Cape Town on Mondays and Wednesdays at 9 a.m., and on Fridays at 11 a.m.

The European mails for the Cape Colony, Natal, the Orange Free State, the South African Republic, as well as for Portuguese East Africa and British Central Africa are forwarded from Cape Town by special trains shortly after the arrival of the mail steamers from England. These trains are appointed to leave Cape Town at one or other of the following times:—8.30 a.m., 1.0 p.m., 8.30 p.m., or 11.30 p.m.

The European mails for the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Rhodesia are conveyed by the 9 p.m. train only.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A "Castle" Company's steamer leaves Natal once a fortnight for Delagoa Bay, and every four weeks for Beira, Mauritius, and Madagascar. The "Union" Company extend their Natal service to Delagoa Bay once every fortnight, and to Beira once a month. Communication is also maintained with East Coast ports north of Delagoa Bay by means of the German East Africa Company's steamers sailing from Natal every three weeks, and there is in addition regular communication with Chinde by means of the steamer "Induna," which sails from Durban, Natal, every three weeks. A frequent but somewhat irregular service from
Cape Town to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Saville and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Laird’s Blue Anchor Line, the White Star Line, and the German-Australian Steamship Company.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily; with Natal daily, via the South African Republic; with the Orange Free State daily, with Rhodesia (Mashonaland, etc.), daily, and with the Transvaal daily by rail through the Orange Free State. The latter is the direct route to the Transvaal, and the journey from Cape Town is performed in little more than two days.

Transit between England and Johannesburg and Pretoria by this route is, therefore, about 20 days.

Overland communication is effected by rail between Cape Town and Delagoa Bay daily, through the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The journey is performed in four days.

The number of Colonial post offices is 942, and of money order offices 302. The expenditure on the postal service amounted to 309,245L in 1898; the revenue was 307,355L, and the commission on money orders 17,497L.

Post Office savings banks were established in 1884. On 30th June, 1899, there was a sum of 2,054,624L 11s. 6d. deposited to the credit of 62,287 depositors. The interest allowed is 2½ per cent. on certificates and 3 per cent. on deposits.

Number of branches 308.

The weights and measures in use are British; besides which there are the Morgen = 2½ acres, the Cape Foot = 10 feet, and the Cape ton = 2,000 lbs.

Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1891 the total population of the Colony was found to be 1,527,224, comprising 767,327 males, and 759,897 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 376,987; Malays, 13,907; Hottentots, 50,388; Fingoes, 229,680; Kaffirs, 608,456; and other coloured persons, 247,806.

Cape Town, which had in 1875 a population of 33,239, had at the census a population of 51,251, and with its suburbs, connected by rail and tramway, 83,898, as compared with 50,259 in 1875. The Cape division, which includes Cape Town, had in 1865, a population of 50,064; in 1875, 57,319; and in 1891, 97,283, of which 48,544 were European and white.

The population of the other principal towns was: Kimberley, 28,718; Port Elizabeth, 23,266; Beaconfield, 10,498; Grahamstown, 10,498; Paarl, 7,668; King Williams Town, 7,226; East London, 6,924; Graaff Reinet, 5,946; Worcester, 5,404; Uitenhage, 5,331; Cradock, 4,389; Oudtshoorn, 4,386; Queenstown, 4,094; Stellenbosch, 3,462; and Somerset East, 2,894.

The following is a brief abstract of the 1891 census returns:

The number of persons of European descent has been estimated as follows:—Dutch, French origin, 230,000; English, Scotch, Irish, &c., 130,000; other Europeans, 16,000.

The European, or white, then, represents one-quarter, and the coloured races three quarters of the total population of the whole colony, whereof one-fifth is urban. The proportion of females is now 99-03 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 6-30. The number of inhabited dwellings was 276,607, of which 522 were not intended for dwelling houses, though used as such.

Birthplaces.—1,472,996 persons had Africa for a birthplace, 49,849 Europe, 2,344 Asia, 988 America, 390 Australasia, 155 were born at sea, and the birthplaces of 502 were unknown or unspecified. About 98-12 per cent. of the population are British subjects.

Religions.—Protestants numbered 732,047; Catholics, 17,275; Jews, 3,009; Mohammedans, 15,099; other sects, 1,394; no denomination, 638; no religion, 725,824; unspecified, 3,277; and 661 persons objected to state their religion.

The population of Pondoland is estimated as follows viz.:—Europeans, 800; others 188,000.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

There is a Legislative Council of 23 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 95 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony, including the Transkeian territories. The Colonial Minister, or the Colonial Secretary (who is Premier), the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Public Works, and the Secretary for Agriculture, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. The session lasts usually from May to August.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act 39 of 1877, a Member is added to the Council for that province, and one has been since added for Bechuanaland (Act No. 41 of 1895). The qualification for Members is possession of immoveable property of 2,000l., or moveable property worth 4,000l. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act of 1892) by possession of property worth 75l. or receipt of salary or wages of not less than 50l. per annum; but no one can be newly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation. The number of registered electors in 1898-9 was 109,888. The Registration Act No. 41 of 1887 makes a better provision for the machinery of registration, and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy.

Elections are now conducted under the Ballot Act.

Members of either house are paid one guinea per day, with 15s. per day extra for not more than 90 days if residing over 15 miles from Capetown. Speeches may be made either in English or in Dutch (Law No. 1 of 1882).

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The supreme court, as consolidated by Act 35, of 1896, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puisne Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall the territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, Pondoland and Tembuland.

The Judges of the “Supreme Court” hold Sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, the Judges of “The Eastern Districts Court,” hold Sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and Transkei, and the Judges of the High Court holds session at Kimberley.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. A “Native Territories Penal Code” came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John’s on 1st January, 1887.

By Act No. 3 of 1890, the Supreme Court has been constituted a Court of Appeal under the Africa Order in Council of 1889, and a similar arrangement exists for Rhodesia.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of eight elective members exclusively of the Civil Commissioner who is usually also Resident Magistrate as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns ten members. The electors are the registered parliamentary voters, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immoveable property in the division valued at not less than 500l. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they also have important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; may promote the establishment of a Divisional Police Force, on payment to Government of one-third of the cost of such force; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court.
revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They were 73 in number in 1898, and their receipts during the year 1898 amounted to £174,228, of which £93 was money borrowed for public works. Payments for the same period amounted to £175,984. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of which are elected annually by the ratepayers. Town councils or municipalities have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value, excepting in Cape town, where a landlord's rate of 3d. may be levied.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There were 95 municipalities in the Colony, whose receipts from all sources during the year 1898 amounted to £778,445, which includes £243,230 loans raised. Payments during the same period amounted to £806,336. The Controller and Auditor-General has no control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 79 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 members elected annually by the voters registered for Parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1897-98 to £10,935, including balances.

Defence.

There is an extensive Admiralty establishment and several forts at Simon's Bay, and to defend this Naval station an Imperial garrison is stationed at Cape Town and Wynberg. The defence of the Colony from native attacks, however devolves since 1871 upon the Colonial forces. These now consist of the Cape Mounted Riflemen (1,903 strong) and the Cape Police (1,922 strong), liable in an emergency, which are permanently embodied and paid. There are also 70 Volunteer Corps and Mounted Rifle Clubs, of all arms, numbering 6,953 men (with 11 guns), maintained by a capitation grant. Table Bay has been strongly fortified at the joint expense of the War Office and the Colonial Government.

Dependent Territories.

Basutoland, which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa, who also holds the office of Governor of the Cape Colony. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under the heading of South Africa.

The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amakosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the Special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now annexed to Cape Colony (see below).

Pingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Nomans Land, as explained in Part I of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government, and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Colonel C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885 the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas, Pali, chief of the Amatshezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pondomisi tribe, under the chiefs Umditshwa and Umhlionlo, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Pondo, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Govern-
ment. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcun was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1896, a commission was sent to put an end to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule, and Magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No.5, of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

WEST PONDOLAND was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Nquiliso. A small strip of this territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The district of Mount Ayllif, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now subject to Colonial rule, and had a revenue of £118,539 in 1896-97, and an expenditure of £210,300; all of this is included in the ordinary Colonial revenue.

They are now re-grouped, under two Chief Magistrates, with several subordinate magistrates, in the following manner, viz.:—

Griqualand East, under the Chief Magistrate, Mr. J. H. Scott, and nine subordinate magistrates. Its population at the close of 1898 was estimated at—Europeans 5,252; coloured, 77,935.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, East and West Pondoland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Major Sir Henry G. Elliot, K.C.M.G., and thirteen subordinate magistrates. It has a population of about 9,227 Europeans and 224,748 natives, including other coloured people.

Transkei, comprising Bingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, all under the Chief Magistrate of Tembuland, and six subordinate magistrates. It has a population of 1,605 Europeans and 173,595 natives, including other coloured people.

BRITISH BECHUANALAND.—On the 30th of September, 1885, the territories south of the Molopo river and of the Ramathlabama spruit were declared to be British territory under the name of British Bechuanaland, and a commission was issued to the Governor of the Cape to be its Governor, with power to legislate by proclamation. The territory was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 16th of November, 1895.
