**SOUTH AUSTRALIA.**

Situation and Area.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of South Australia. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vic., c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, has also been annexed to South Australia, and is known as the Northern Territory. The whole Colony covers twenty-seven degrees of latitude, and twelve degrees of longitude, and includes an area of 903,690 square miles (equal to twice France and Germany together).

Kangaroo Island (90 m. by 25 m.; area 1,500 sq. m., 1,000 ft. highest point), Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands, near Port Darwin, and Groote Eylandt, the Pellew Archipelago, and others in the Gulf of Carpentaria are included in the Colony.

Adelaide, the capital of the Colony, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

History.

The south coast of the Colony was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Sturt in 1829 discovered the Murray River and its upper tributaries. The South Australian Company, upon Wakefield's principles, was formed in England in 1834, under the Act mentioned above, and the first settlements were formed at Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in 1836. Copper was discovered 1842, by Menge. Responsible government was established in 1856. Stuart reached Port Darwin 1861, and the "Northern Territory" was added to the Colony in 1861 and 1868.

Since the enlargement, it ranks as the third in size of British colonies.

**Climate.**

The rainfall at Adelaide averages 21 inches annually, mostly from May to October. It varies from 16 to 42 inches on the plains and hills respectively. The mean temperature 74°, the extreme range being from 35° to 112°.

**General Government.**

The Parliament of South Australia consists of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, created by the Local Act No. 2 of 1855-56, which was proclaimed on October 25th, 1856. This Act, commonly called the Constitution Act, was passed by virtue of the Imperial Act 13 and 14 Vic., cap. 59.

The Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as originally constituted, consisted of 18 and 36 members respectively. By the Local Act No. 27 of 1875 the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881 six members were added to the Legislative Council, and the Colony was divided into four electoral districts for the purpose of Council elections. In 1882 the House of Assembly was further increased to 52 members, representing 26 electoral districts; and by Act No. 450 of 1888 the Northern Territory was created an electoral district, returning 2 members, thus raising the number to 54.

The four electoral districts of the Legislative Council are,—No. 1, Central; No. 2, Southern; No. 3, North-eastern; and No. 4, Northern; returning six members each. On April 14th, 1897, and every three years thereafter, the two members who stand first on the roll retire, and their successors are appointed by each of the four districts electing 2 members. The new members are placed at the bottom of the roll of their district, the member receiving most votes at the election being placed last. Elections are conducted by ballot. Act No. 236, of 1881, provides for a penal dissolution of the Council, or the calling up of additional members, if the Council twice reject a Bill which has been twice passed by the House of Assembly, a general election having intervened. But the dissolution or the calling up of members is permissive, not compulsory; and if members are called up no vacancies may be filled while the total number of members is 24 or more.

The quorum of the Council consists of nine members, including the President.

The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the Queen, and that he has resided in the Province for three years. The qualification of a voter is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and have been on the electoral roll for a period of six months. He must also be possessed of either a freehold of the value of 50l. or of a leasehold of the annual value of 20l., having three years to run, or with right of purchase, or be in occupation of a dwelling-house of the annual rent value of 25l. Members of both houses are paid 200l. per annum.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; and each of the 27 electoral districts returns two members. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be qualified and entitled to be registered as an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, a natural born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and have been six months on the electoral roll. The total number of electors in
1898 for the Legislative Council is 47,151, of whom 9,121 were females, and for the House of Assembly 151,143, of which about 67,963 were women. The session is usually from June to December.

The franchise for both Houses was extended to adult women by an Act of 1894.

Responsible government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature, who form the Cabinet, and are ex officio members of the Executive Council.

Local Government.

There are 33 municipalities in the Colony, whose powers are regulated by the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1890." The governing body consists of Mayor, Aldermen (Aldermen are at present elected for City of Adelaide only), and Councillors, elected by the ratepayers, who also elect the Auditors. The Council has power to levy rates for municipal purposes only on all house and land property within the municipal area, but the question of raising a loan must be submitted to a general meeting of the ratepayers, and a poll must be taken if demanded by the ratepayers. There are also 130 district councils having somewhat similar powers. The aggregate assessment of the property within the municipal areas and District Councils amounts to £2,518,688, and the revenue in 1898 amounted to £283,855, and the expenditure to £272,735.

Population.

The population of the Colony (including the northern territory) at the close of census, 1891, was 320,431 persons, at end of 1898, 362,897. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are about 2,600. There are about 230 Chinese in the colony. The immigration of Chinese is restricted by no vessel being allowed to enter any port or place in the Province having on board a greater number of Chinese than one Chinese to every five hundred tons of the registered tonnage of such vessel." Penalty, on conviction, £500, for each Chinese in excess of such number.

Any Chinese entering the Province by land without first obtaining a permit in writing from some person to be appointed by the Governor in Council shall be liable, on conviction, to a penalty of not less than £5, nor more than £20," and is also liable to be deported to the colony whence he came.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide including the suburbs, number 147,616. In 1898 the population of the city was 114,149, and of the suburbs 33,467.

About 85 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 26 per cent.

Education.

The University of Adelaide was founded by Royal Letters Patent in 1881, and an Act of the local Parliament in 1874. It was endowed by private munificence, aided by an annual grant of 5 per cent. on all sums contributed from private sources and an endowment of land, the total amount of income being about £12,000. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and music; the staff consists of 8 professors and 43 lecturers. All classes are open to women, 11 ladies 1898-99 students among those attending extension lectures.

In connection with the Art Gallery a School of Design has been formed, in which more than 350 students are instructed in painting and designing for technical purposes.

The School of Mines and Industries was established in 1889. It is supported by an annual parliamentary vote of about £2,500, and by school fees. Diplomas are awarded in mining, metallurgy, and mechanical engineering. The staff consists of 20 officers and teachers. The students number about 700.

Primary education is provided for by the Education Acts of 1875, 1878, and 1891, by which the management of public education is committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free from January 1, 1892, up to the compulsory standard, and it has been compulsory since 1876. There are 670 schools, with 1,253 teachers, and 61,673 scholars.

The expenses of the Education Department for pay-roll of teachers, &c., were, during 1898, £144,805. The total expenditure on school buildings up to the end of 1898 was £453,578. The lands dedicated to educational purposes amount to 459,947 acres, and the land leased was 390,115 acres, at an annual rental of £6,904.

For the maintenance of the South Australian Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, also country institutes in 1898, the sum expended was £10,329.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the Province consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, and Gladstone, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; and at Palmerston, Northern Territory, by the Judge of the Northern Territory; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court; Local Courts of Insolvency at Port Augusta, Gladstone, Mount Gambier, and Moonta, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; and at Palmerston, Northern Territory, by the Judge of the Northern Territory; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction in all the principal towns throughout the Province with full jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates, and Limited Jurisdiction, by Justices of the Peace; and Police Magistrates' Courts.

The number of convictions in the Supreme Court has averaged during the last three years 140, or less than one in every 2,592 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. There can be no doubt that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community. The total value of the lands brought under the operation of this law to the end of 1898 amounts to £15,316,987 sterling.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes. The amount of the Public Debt outstanding (excluding Northern Territory) on 31st December, 1898, was £22,645,105.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling. The local banks issued
notes to the extent of £47,201L., and had on 31st December, 1898, 5,412,220L deposits.

Eight banking institutions carry on business within the Province, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland towns—numbering altogether 150 branches and agencies. The names are—the Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Limited; National Bank of Australasia, Limited; English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Limited; Bank of Adelaide; Bank of New South Wales; Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited; and Bank of New Zealand. The total average liabilities of the eight banks amounted to (31st December, 1898) £2,361,305L., and the total paid-in assets £6,809,693L.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 132 agencies. The number of depositors on 31st December, 1898, was 109,968, and the total deposits amounted to 3,080,514L. One in four of the population is a depositor in savings banks.

Industry.

It may be roughly estimated that not more than 150,000 square miles of the area of the Colony, excluding the Northern Territory, are at present put to productive use. Agricultural settlement has not extended far afield from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached 1,200 miles. Forty-six counties have been proclaimed to 31st December, 1898, embracing 80,542 square miles, or 51,546,880 acres. Of this large area only 8,507,943 acres have been alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to upwards of 108 acres for each square mile of the Colony. About one in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to leasing, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 20,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, water-tanks, &c. At present there is as yet open for immediate leasing, in addition to 8,747,240 acres open as "pastoral lands," of which 5,888,000 is vermin infested country at peppercorn rental.

About two-thirds the total area of land cultivated (2,967,370 acres) is cropped with wheat, of which 1,788,770 acres were cultivated in 1898. Wine cultivation is an industry of progressive tendency. There are 1,159 acres of land devoted to this purpose in 1898. Wine trade 1,263,998 gals. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a high character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants; of the former 6,190 cwt., and of the latter, 1,133 cwt., were made in 1897.

Almond trees are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment.

The Colony possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive. Olive oil of the most delicious character has been exported, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and general superiority over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a high position in the local market.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. In 1898 there were no less than 96,668 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 161,774; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 260,849; of sheep from 1,000,000 to over 5,012,630, whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 104,946 bales.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; while these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, and there are now many steam flour mills, saw mills, foundries, agricultural implement works, breweries, &c. Several marble and slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened, and recently an extensive quarry of marble has been opened near Kangaroo Point.

The gasworks of the Colony are eight in number, of which one is for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, and the remaining six are in the principal country towns. 329 vessels of 50,986 tons were in 1898 registered at Port Adelaide.

Of £2,487,996L. worth of staple produce exported, the value of breadstuffs amounted to 261,898L.; while wool represented 945,588L., and copper 244,863L.

The total value of wool shipped in 1898 was 412,163L.; 1866, 990,163L.; and in 1898, 1,167,181L.

The chief imports are textiles, sugar, alcohol, tea, coffee, hardware, and machinery. 80 per cent of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australian colonies, the bulk of the remainder being with the United States, China, and Mauritius. The chief copper mines are those at Moonta and Wallaroo; the chief gold fields, Angipenna, Barossa, Blumberg, Lethuna, Luxemburg, Mount Grange, Mount Pleasant, Mount Torrens, Nillumbok, Tatiwana, Ulooloo, Wadawurrung, Woodside, and Warramunga, and Burraundie and MacDonnell Ranges in the N.T.

Means of Communication.

There are 7,569 miles of road defined in the settled districts. The greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed by the Government—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 3,678. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

The railway line, excepting a part of a private line between Adelaide and Glenelg, are all constructed and worked by the Government. The mileage opened for traffic in the Colony, exclusive of Northern Territory, is 1,724. Up to December 31st, 1898, the total cost of the railways reached 12,833,572L. The receipts in 1898 were 1,017,432L., and the expenditure 590,558L. Net balance, 3,276,014L. There is direct railway communication between Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.

The geographical position of South Australia necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the Australian telegraphs, so as to afford communications with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. To accomplish this South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of tele-
graph some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over £50,000, across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party. An additional wire is now being erected at a cost of over £50,000.

At present the railway reaches Oodnadatta, 688 miles north of Adelaide, and Pine Creek, 146 miles south of Palmerston, the intervening gap being 1,200 miles.

At the close of the year 1898 there were 268 stations, and 5,874 miles of line open throughout the colony, and there are several lines now in course of construction. There are 361 miles of telephone line open, 8 light exchanges, 1,141 connections, and 3,075 miles of telegraph wires open. The number of messages sent in 1898 was 1,062,503, of which 125,512 were international.

Internal water communication is afforded by the Murray River, on which steamers run for 2,000 miles. There is regular and frequent communication by mail steamers with all parts of Australasia as well as with Europe and San Francisco. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, Newspapers per ½ oz. each | Australasia | United Kingdom and Postal Union Countries |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| not exceeding 10 ozs.             | 2           | 21                                       |

The total number of letters and postcards sent and received in 1898 was 19,391,816; packets, 1,501,082; newspapers, 8,803,154.

Defences.

The local military force numbers 1,324 officers and men. The naval force consists of H.M.S. "Protector," 17 guns, with an establishment of 166 officers and men including Naval Reserve. Batteries have been erected at Glenville and Largs Bay, to protect the harbour of Port Adelaide.
