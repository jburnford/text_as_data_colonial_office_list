ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.

The Island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 96,000 acres of land, about half the area of Middlesex. Most of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from Kingstown.

General Description.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contained at the census of 1921, a population of 3,836 souls. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1926, 26 vessels of a net tonnage of 585 tons.

There are five other small towns in the island, the most important being Georgetown on the north-east, and Barrouallie on the west.

The most striking natural feature of the island is its "Soufrière," or volcano, situated at the northern extremity of the island, and rising to about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea. After a violent eruption in 1812, it remained dormant for a period of ninety years, and then broke into violent eruption again on May 7th, 1902, when the entire northern half of the island was devastated, and nearly 2,000 lives were lost. The eruption synchronised with that of Mont Pelée in Martinique which destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The "Soufrière" remained intermittently active throughout 1902, and there was a further eruption in March, 1903, since when it has remained quiescent.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded and almost impassable mountains traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north-east of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. This district formerly comprised the most fertile sugar estates. The next highest point after the "Soufrière" in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are numerous but small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond River.

In September, 1898, the island was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution. In September, 1921, the island was again struck by a hurricane which, although not as violent as its predecessor, did considerable damage to property and crops, entailing considerable hardship on the populace and necessitating the expenditure by Government of £3,288. on relief measures.

Climate.

In the dry season, January to May, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy, and fever is almost unknown. The nights are cool all the year round. The rainfall during 1926 was 78·86 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during the same year was 82·1°F., the lowest 78·6°F., the mean monthly temperature being 80·7°F. in the shade. The prevailing wind is N.E.

Industry and Communications.

Sugar, syrup, rum, cocoa, and excellent arrow-root are produced. The cultivation of coconuts, ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention, and Sea Island cotton, the best in the Empire, is extensively planted, for the ginning of which a Government Ginnery has been erected. Most of the sugar and all the arrowroot mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivable land is owned by a few individuals; portions of Crown lands, have been alienated to peasant proprietors, and several estates have been purchased by the Government with the aid of an Imperial grant and allotted to the same class of settlers. The forests produce excellent woods. There are 65 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne. There are also some 300 miles of byeway connecting with the highway.

The port of Kingstown is visited fortnightly by steamers of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine Ltd., and the R.M.S.P. Coy.; monthly by steamers of the Colombian Line and occasionally by steamers of the Harrison Line.

A telephone system has been established, having 1 central and 3 branch exchanges, with 219 connections and some 188 miles of line.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.
No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands.

In 1722 George L made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £63,625.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but in 1796 the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overrun the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British headquarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Ruatan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the negro slaves. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first East Indian Coolie labourers in 1861. Most of them returned to India, but some made their home in the Colony.

**Constitution**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly. The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1866 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1869 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1869 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony, and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. (The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.)

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 & 40 Vict. c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. Until 1st December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of official and unofficial members nominated and appointed by the Crown.

By an Order in Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, four ex officio members, one nominated unofficial member and three elected members. The Island is divided into three electoral districts, each returning one elected member.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is the sole Judge of this court.

**Education**

There were, on 31st December, 1926, 28 primary schools, with 5,407 children on the rolls. The average attendance during 1926 was 2,892. There is also a government secondary school for boys, and a high school for girls.

An Island Scholarship is awarded biennially tenable for from three to five years at an approved University. Annual value £200, and cost of passage.

The Government expenditure on primary education in 1926 was £3,449l.

**Savings Bank**

A savings bank was established in 1866, and had 729 depositors, with £14,561l. deposited, on 31st December, 1926. Branches of the bank have been opened at Georgetown, Barrouallie, and Union Island.

THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward Islands consist of the three lands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, ring in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically, Tobago from 1764 to 1783, and all three in 1838. The three first-named islands are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the three Colonies is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and their estimated population at the census of 24th April, 1921, 162,254.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their general federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. Dominica separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776, and 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1838 Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

In the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were issued constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago subsequently united with Trinidad. The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white and there are some Indian Coolies. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent. English is spoken throughout, in St. Lucia, the prevailing language with peasantry is a French patois. In Grenada the same condition obtains, but to a less extent.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and, when the Governor is absent, is presided over by an Agent Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. A Windward Islands Court of Appeal was set up in 1850 (13 & 14 Vict. c. 15), and abolished in 1920 by an Act (9 & 10 Geo. V. c. 47), which set up a Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the chief justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica. There is also a common audit system instituted in 1889.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada, which have branches in the larger islands, issue five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

Communications.

The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 14 days.

The steamers of Harrison Direct Line call at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Furness, Withy Line. The passenger and cargo steamers of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine call regularly at Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent, and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telephone system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in communication with Europe, the United States, Canada, and the other West Indian islands by wireless, operated by the Pacific Cable Board, and by the Cables of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company Ltd. The rate per word for telegrams to the United Kingdom from Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent is 2s. 4d. The rate to Europe varies from 3s. 2½d. to 3s. 7½d. per word. (Government messages pay half rates.) There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

A wireless installation has been erected at Carriacou by the local Government. It communicates with Grenada and through that island to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, &c., the ordinary tariff being 2d. per word more than from Grenada.
