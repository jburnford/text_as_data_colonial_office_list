ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 46° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. The Settlement (the total area of which, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles) consists of two old craters forming rocky peninsulas—Aden proper (area 21 square miles; population 43,106), on the south, and Little Aden (area 15 square miles; population 565), on the west—and a flat strip of coast, about three miles broad and known as Shaik Othman (area 39 square miles; population 10,774). The peninsulas form the horns of a bay called Aden Back Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. The native town of Aden is situated on the east of the Aden peninsula, opposite a gap in the crater walls. On the west side of the peninsula, some four miles from the town, is Steamer Point, off which the large steamers lie. The highest point of the peninsula is 1,776 feet above sea level. The average annual rainfall is about 3 inches, and the maximum is about 8 inches. The climate is very hot, especially during the summer months. The Aden Protectorate, to the north and north-east of Aden, has an area of about 9,000 square miles and a population of over 100,000. Aden is an important coaling station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc. The settlement forms part of British India, and is subject to the Government of Bombay, and administered by a Resident, who has hitherto been also commander of the troops in the garrison, and who is assisted by three officers of the Bombay Political Department, a Judicial officer, an officer of the Public Works Department as Chairman of the Aden Settlement and Port Trust, a Police officer from the Bombay Provincial Police Department, and a military officer in charge of Perim.

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians and Persians. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1551 and held it until they were expelled from the Yemen in 1630. The Aden peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchases in 1882 and 1888.

As from 1st April, 1927, the responsibility for military affairs in Aden and for the affairs of the Protectorate was transferred to the Colonial Office.

Perim, a bare rocky island, five square miles in area, with a population of about 2,000, lies in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, about 1½ miles from the south-west corner of Arabia. It possesses a good harbour on the south-west side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth. It was occupied by the British in 1799, but subsequently abandoned, and was only re-occupied in 1857, when the overland route to India made the position important. It is a coaling and cable station, and forms part of the Settlement of Aden.

Soqotra, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 19'—12° 42' N. lat., and 53° 21'—53° 30' E. long. and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the Government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belonged. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island is about 12,000. It is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October, 1886, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kute and Bromers Islands.
