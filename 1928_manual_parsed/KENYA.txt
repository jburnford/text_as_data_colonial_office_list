KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," until recently known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the coast line from Umba River to Dick's Head, and vast territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy on June 29th, 1925, a Commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. It includes the Witu Protectorate, a small tract of country at the mouth of the Tana. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew on July 31st, 1893. Witu is now regarded for administrative purposes as part of Tanaland.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays a rent of 10,000l. per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the latter has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 225,100 square miles.

A scheme of administration providing for the separate control of the native and the settled areas, was brought into operation on the 1st of January, 1921.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into the following areas:

1. The Nyanza Province, comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Nandi, Kericho, Kisumu, and Lumbwa.
2. The Kerio Province, comprising the districts of Ravine, Baringo, Elgeyo, Marakwet, West Suk, and Turkana.

3. The Kikuyu Province, comprising the districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, Embu, Meru, North Ngeri.

4. The Ukamba Province, comprising the districts of Machakos, Kitui, Teita, and Nairobi.

5. The Coast Province, comprising the districts of Digo, Malindi, Tana River, Lamu.

6. The Masai Province.

7. The Northern Frontier Province.

8. The Extra-Provincial Districts of Laikipia, Naivasha, Nakuru, Uasin-Gishu, and Trans-Nzoia.

The capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is also the largest centre in the Colony. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Europeans | Asiatics | Natives |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1925 | ...       | ...      | 3,612   |
|      | ...       | ...      | 9,589   |
|      | ...       | ...      | 19,633  |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 39,824, of whom about 869 are Europeans. It is situated on the eastern side of an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, on the south-western side of the island. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the Port. Kilindini is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply and a scheme for improved harbour facilities is being carried out. Two deep-water berths have been constructed, and two more are under construction.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana, which is navigable for about 400 miles by shallow draught steamers.

**Population.**

The total population is estimated at 2,736,517. A census of the non-native population taken in February, 1926, showed a European population of 12,529 and an Asiatic population of 41,140. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Nuer, the Nandi, the Lumbwa, the Suk, the Turkanas, the Masai, the Somalis, and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish, and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

**Constitution.**

Under the Royal Instructions dated the 11th September, 1920, as amended by Additional Instructions dated the 28th December, 1925, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, the Director of Agriculture, and Director of Education (ex officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, eleven ex officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, and one nominated unofficial member to represent the interests of the African community. Under Royal instructions dated the 28th March, 1927, it was provided that if at any time the number of Indian elected members is less than five the vacancy or vacancies so arising might be filled by the appointment of nominated Indian unofficial members. The ex officio members are to be the ex officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railway, Commissioner of Lands, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate form one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment.

**Climate.**

For purposes of rainfall Kenya may be divided into three parts:

1. Northern Desert area where there is usually less than 20 inches a year.
2. The coastal strip and the Nyanza and Kikuyu Provinces where there may be from 40 to 80 inches a year, and
3. The remainder of Kenya where rainfall is from 20 to 40 inches a year. On the Coast there is usually a single rainy season from April to November, but up-country there are generally "long" rains from April to June, and "short" rains from October to December. The Coastal regions have a tropical climate though nights are cool except during the hottest months from December to April. In the Highlands the climate is invigorating with cool breezes; at Nairobi the mean maximum shade temperature in 1926 was 79° and the mean minimum 56°. The rainfall at Nairobi was 32·15 inches.

**Currency and Banks.**

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local
coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at Is. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent. piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921, from circulation. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents. of a rupee) have been withdrawn from circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents. of a shilling) have been introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Treasurer.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26 Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe, and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Kitale in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) with which is amalgamated The National Bank of South Africa, Ltd., has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, and Eldoret.

Land and Products.

The agricultural products of the lowlands are coconuts, cotton, maize, sisal, sugar cane and the miscellaneous native grains, and oil seed.

Effort towards an extension of the area under cotton is being made. In the highlands, coffee, maize, sisal are the premier crops and an increasing export trade in these products is noteworthy. Cereals (wheat and barley) are successfully grown, while sugar cane, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and a large variety of miscellaneous crops are cultivated on an increasing scale.

Extensive pasture grounds exist throughout the highlands, and maintain considerable herds of grade and native stock.

Sheep thrive in restricted areas, and the export of wool is steadily increasing.

The forest products of the coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber and gum-copal. The scrub forests further inland contain ebony and scrub mahogany. The highland forests contain croton, pencil cedar in large quantities and several good timbers. Several large areas of fibre-bearing land have been leased near Voi and Kibwezi for the purpose of developing the Sansevieria fibre, which is indigenous. Sisal and rubber are being extensively planted.

The mineral resources of the Colony are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; mica, diatomite and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba; gold prospecting activities exist south of Kisii. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

The total area of land alienated as at December 31st, 1926, was 6,005,774 acres of which 5,489,599 acres were leasehold. Sale of leases of land by public auction has been resumed.

Trade and Customs.

Since 1917 Kenya and Uganda have been one administrative unit for purposes of Customs.

The Customs Tariff has not been subjected to any considerable revision since 1923. A consumption tax was placed on wines and spirits in 1926. Up to 1921 an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. was in force for practically all imports other than spirits, and certain articles for industrial, agricultural, stock breeding, railway and other services, were admitted free of duty.

The principal export duties were derived from:

(a) a specific tax ranging between 2 and 2½ shillings on birds and animals.

(b) an ad valorem tax ranging between 4 per cent. and 30 per cent. on borities (rafters), chillies, ebony, gum copal, hides, horns, ivory, rubber, sea shells and hippopotamus teeth.

Legislation enacted in 1921-3, terminating with the Kenya Customs Tariff Ordinance of the 31st December, 1923, has introduced many important changes, the most notable being:

(a) a uniform Tariff for Kenya and Uganda which operates also in Tanganyika Territory.

(b) free trade between Kenya and Uganda, and Tanganyika Territory, in goods the growth, produce or manufacture of each of the Territories.

(c) specific duties on certain classes of imports generally ranging between 10 per cent. and 50 per cent. of their value.

(d) ad valorem duties ranging between 10 per cent. and 30 per cent. on imports not included in the specific list or otherwise provided for. These duties are assessed on the basis of the value of the goods at the port of shipment, plus the cost of packing, loading, freight, insurance, landing and all other charges up to the time of deposit in the Customs premises at the port of importation.

(e) thorough revision of the free list which, while generally maintaining existing exemptions, has added passengers' personal and used household effects, disinfectants, surgical instruments, mining materials, and school stationery and similar requisites, etc.

(f) entire abolition of export duties.

The import tariff as it now stands has been designed, as far as possible, to protect imports essential to the opening up and development of the country at the expense of those of less utility; and to foster local production of agricultural and other commodities in which Kenya and Uganda are, or can be made, self-supporting.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value, in £ sterling, of trade imports (excluding imports on Government
account, railway material, and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign), and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources (rupee 16d. till 1921) and the tonnage entered at Kenya ports were as follows:

| Years | Imports | Total Customs Tonnage | Gross tonnage |
|-------|---------|------------------------|--------------|
|       |         |                       |              |

| 1926   | 7,440,649 | 7,844,681 | 1,150,593 | 1,555,570 |

Up to 31st March, 1921, the fiscal year was from 1st April to 31st March. The nine months in 1921 was from 1st April to 31st December. From then onwards the year is:—1st January to 31st December.

Communications.

The Union Castle Line and the British India Steam Navigation Co. maintain a monthly service of passenger steamers from and to London.

The Messageries Maritimes from Marseilles to Madagascar call fortnightly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards.

The “Italiana” Navigation Company have two lines calling monthly; one steamer running as far as Zanzibar, and back to Genoa, and the other as far as Durban, and also back to Genoa, calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland.

The Clan Ellerman Harrison Line maintains a three-weekly service of fast cargo steamers from Liverpool as far as Beira.

The Holland Africa Line maintains a fortnightly service from London and continental ports to South and East Africa calling at this Port.

The Deutsche Ost Afrika line maintains a six-weekly passenger and cargo service between Mombasa, Continental ports and Southampton.

The Osaka Shoen Kaisha Line also serves Mombasa and calls are made by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and by Danish and Norwegian Lines.

The fortnightly Mail Service to Bombay and Durban is maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company passenger and cargo steamers.

Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co. and Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw Bros.

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by a Central Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Colony (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On the 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda. It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the Governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway. The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory’s representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the Services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

The length of the line including branches, open to traffic at the end of 1926, was 1,128 miles, with a gauge of one metre. A further length of 233 miles was under construction at that date. Ten steamers on Lake Victoria are worked in connection
with the railway and there are flotillas on Lake Kioga and Lake Albert. The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda. The construction cost, including steamers, etc., to December 31st, 1926, was £14,483,586. During the year ending 31st December, 1926, 573,282 tons of goods (exclusive of railway material) and 991,754 passengers were carried.

Year ending 31/12/26.

Revenue: £2,058,710
Expenditure: £1,216,773

A branch railway has been constructed from Nakuru (at mile 448 on the Uganda Railway) to Turbo (142 miles) on the Uasin Gishu plateau, and is now open to traffic. This line is at present being extended through Tororo in Uganda to Mbulamuti on the Busoga Railway, and when completed will afford through communication between Kilindini and the Port of Jinja on Lake Victoria. The approximate mileage of this extension with branches is 255.

Pauling & Co., Ltd., have constructed a deep-water wharf wall at Ras Kilindini, with sheds. A contract for 1,000 feet extension of the quay, together with single-storied transit sheds and the necessary roads and railways in connection therewith, estimated to cost £63,947, was entered into with the same company in November, 1926.

The Post Office of the Colony (inclusive of the Uganda Post Office, which is worked by the Kenya Post Office) received and despatched during 1926 11,451,700 letters, packets, etc., and 522,044 telegrams.

The telegraph system has 7,124 miles of wire (exclusive of Uganda). The lines connect Mombasa with Lamu (200 miles), Mombasa with Gazi (31 miles), Mombasa with Kisumu (587 miles), Kisumu with Entebbe (281 miles) (75 miles double line in Kenya, remainder in Uganda), Londiani with Eldama Ravine (22 miles), Lumbwa with Kericho (17½ miles), Nairobi with Nyeri, West Kenya, Meru and Archers Post (204 miles), Kibigori with Nandi, Eldoret, Sergott, Hoey's Bridge and Kitale (107 miles), Magadi Junction with Machakos (16½ miles), Magadi Railway (91 miles), Elmenteita with Narok (58 miles), Nakuru with Rumuruti (59 miles), Rongai with Solai (27 miles), Muhoroni with Songhor (10 miles), Nairobi with Nyambu (10 miles), Voi to Tanganyika Border (81 miles). Lines follow all Railway lines and Branch lines. Communications between Mombasa and Kisimayu (325 miles), from both these stations with ships at sea and, (for Government traffic only), between Mombasa and Zanzibar is maintained by means of radio-telegraphy. A cable connects Mombasa with Zanzibar.

Telegraph communication exists with Tanganyika Territory by means of lines between Voi on the Kenya and Uganda Railway and Taveta. The Kenya telegraph system is also linked up by land lines with South African and Belgian Congo telegraph systems.

Telephone exchanges are worked at Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu Post Offices; 1782 telephones were in use in Kenya and Uganda at the end of 1926.

Preliminary survey flights between Kisumu and Khartum, the cost of which is to be borne in part by the Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan Governments, were started in February, 1927, with a view to deciding the feasibility of an air mail service on that route.

E. Africa Governors' Conference.

In pursuance of a recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission which visited E. Africa in 1924, a Conference of Governors of the British East African dependencies was held in Nairobi in January and February, 1926, for the discussion of matters of mutual concern. It was decided that Conferences should be held from time to time at Nairobi. There is a permanent Secretary of the Conference at Nairobi, Col. C. W. G. Walker, D.S.O., I.A., whose salary of £1,500 a year together with the cost of the Secretariat is jointly contributed by the Governments members of the Conference.
