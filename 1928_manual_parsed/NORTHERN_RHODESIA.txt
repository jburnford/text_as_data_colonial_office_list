NORTHERN RHODESIA.

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the Territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambezi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 287,950 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine magisterial districts for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Livingstone, situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls. Other important settlements are at Broken Hill, the centre of the mining industry, Fort Jameson, Luaka, Masabuka, Ndola near which the copper mines of Bwana Mukuba are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery and Mongu-Lealui in Barotseland.

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer, with whose advent the authentic history of Northern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at the Zambezi near the place where the town bearing his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interception on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the great war with forces from German East Africa, and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey ordered a general advance into German East Africa of the troops under his command, and by July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy. Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbeck doubled southwards, and on the 1st November made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier station, Fife. From there they proceeded southwest to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies for the forces operating on the border. The bulk of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the first news of the enemy's advance. After burning most of the buildings and their remaining contents, Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu motor-road, and early on the 13th November, his advanced parties opened fire on the British South Africa Company's rubber factory on the Chambezi River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice was received by the District Commissioner and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted the position and suspended hostilities. The number of individual Rhodesians (men and women) known to have undertaken duties in connection with the war was 7,009. Of these 6,359 served with H.M. Forces during the war, 459 being from Northern Rhodesia. 791 were killed in action or died of wounds or disease.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He relinquished office on the 20th September, 1923, and was succeeded by Mr. R. A. J. Goode as Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika District of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company

* Captains with fifteen years total service receive 750l. per annum. Captains with less than fifteen years total service receive 700l. per annum.
† Lieutenants with seven years total service receive 600l. per annum. Lieutenants with less than seven years total service receive 510l. per annum.
would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 25th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924 the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs and the Principal Medical Officer. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and five unofficial elected members. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H.J. Stanley, O.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, K.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District officers. The Barotse District is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied. The Civil jurisdiction of Native Commissioners' Courts is limited to causes or matters concerning natives. They also have criminal jurisdiction over natives with limitations. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from Native Commissioners' Courts to Magistrates, and from Magistrates' Courts to the High Court.

Population.

|       | European | Native |
|-------|----------|--------|
|       | Male     | Female | Total | Male | Female | Total |
| Census |          |        |       |      |        |       |
| 1911   | 1,121    | 376    | 1,497 | —    | —      | 831,102 |
| 1921   | 2,263    | 1,371  | 3,634 | 447,841 | 532,064 | 979,906 |

The European population at the 31st December, 1926, was returned as 5,581, comprising 2,742 adult males, 1,326 adult females and 1,513 children. The native population was estimated to be 1,199,641.

Education.

European.—For the education of European children, there were, in 1927, Government Schools at Livingstone, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Broken Hill and Fort Jameson. At all of these, with the exception of the school at Fort Jameson, primary education up to Standard VII was given, with the additional subjects, Latin, French, Algebra in Standards VI and VII and Geometry in Standard VII. At Fort Jameson primary education was given up to Standard V. Four Farm Schools were open during the year at Silver Rest, Mulendema, Chilongolo and Lubombo, 1 mile school at Bwana M'Kubwa and 3 aided schools at Malanda, Kalomo and the M'tuga Mine. In all these education was given up to Standard V.

The Codrington School at Mazabuka has been a mixed boarding school throughout the year, but, on the opening of the Beit School at Choma, the girls will be transferred to that school, which is being built to provide a separate girls' boarding school.

Native.—With the exception of the Barotse National School at Mongu which is under Government control, the actual education of the natives is in the hands of the Missionary Societies. A Director of Native Education has been appointed, and a system of Government Grants-in-aid to Missionary Societies who agree to conform to the general educational policy of the Government has been instituted. An Advisory Board in Native Education has been set up, upon which missionaries, settlers, and Government Departments are represented. A central agricultural research station at which native agricultural and veterinary demonstrators can be trained is under construction.

Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from $70^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ with a maximum of $103^\circ$ and a minimum of $56^\circ$. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from $55^\circ$ to $75^\circ$ with a maximum of $86^\circ$ and a minimum of $40^\circ$. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of $120^\circ$, whilst minima round about $30^\circ$ are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period July to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70 % to 90 % of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again. The average rainfall so far as present investigations show is 37.5 inches per annum.
Commerce and Industry.

Farming and ranching occupy a considerable portion of the European inhabitants. Maize was, formerly, the chief crop and the demand for this is steadily increasing.

The cultivation of cotton has received a severe check on account of insect pests and fungoid diseases. The amount of tobacco produced is rapidly increasing and it is estimated that the value of tobacco to be exported will be between 100,000l. and 200,000l. at local prices. The variety grown, a Rhodesian strain of Virginia tobacco, produces high grade tobacco and finds a ready market. The amount of wheat produced is increasing annually. The establishment of a Co-operative Wheat Mill in the wheat area, has been a great incentive to industry. Other crops are citrus, coffee, ground nuts, and potatoes. The increase in mining activities has caused a greater demand in the Territory and in the Belgian Congo for foodstuffs of all varieties. The ranching industry is of considerable importance but it is quite incapable of supplying the demands made upon it. As a consequence, many thousands of cattle pass through Northern Rhodesia from Southern Rhodesia and N'Gamiland each year to supply the markets of the Belgian Congo. The estimated requirements of Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo, for slaughter cattle, is 40,000 head per annum.

The dairying industry is small but is making steady progress. There is scope for greater increase in the production of dairy products, as the Territory produces under a quarter of the requirements of the local demand and of the Belgian Congo. The balance is imported from the south.

A central agricultural research and demonstration station is in the course of establishment where plant breeding, seed selection, demonstration work with crops and plantations of exotic trees are to be carried out. A herd of pedigree cattle is to be established. A laboratory for veterinary research is to be erected. The station will be of value to intending settlers who may wish to gain experience before commencing farming in the Territory and will be used for training native artisans, farm capitalists, and village demonstrators. Land suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 18s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc.

A settler must be in possession of at least 2,000l. capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

Extensive mineral deposits of lead and zinc have been located at Broken Hill and of copper at Bwans Mkubwa and elsewhere in the north-western districts. Gold and silver have been discovered and coal exists in quantity but is not being worked at present. The total value of the mineral output of Northern Rhodesia from the commencement of operations to the 31st December, 1926, was 3,957,901l. (subject to adjustment).

In the year 1926, 778 ounces of gold, 114 ounces of silver, 3,835 tons of lead, 708 tons of copper, 3 tons of mica, 485 tons zinc ore, 235 tons zinc, 25 tons vanadium were produced.

Means of Communication.

The extension of the railway from Victoria Falls northward was opened for traffic as far as Broken Hill, 374 miles from the Falls, in 1906, and the further extension to the northern border of Northern Rhodesia was completed by the Rhodesia Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company Limited in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a bridge 630 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet above the level of the river. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa. Road communications are gradually being opened and good motor tracks are now in use from Livingstone to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge, and also to Abercorn and from thence to Tanganyika and Kenya Colony. The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambesi rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyasaland. There are 38 post offices in the territory, 10 of which are money order offices. There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and other lines link up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the territory is 2,350 miles.
