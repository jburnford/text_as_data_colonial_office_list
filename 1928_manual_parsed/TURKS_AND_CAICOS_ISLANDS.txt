TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is about 166 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 64 miles long and 1½ miles broad. According to the census of 1921 Grand Turk contains 1,668 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population which in 1921 was 5,612. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

Grand Turk claims to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas. In 1873 they were annexed to Jamaica and still remain one of its dependencies.

Two hurricanes passed over these Islands in 1926, on July 24th and September 16th respectively, and did great damage. The second one was the most disastrous, as regards damage to property, in the history of the Dependency.

Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the average quantity annually gathered being about 1,600,000 bushels, equal to 56,000 tons. 1,510,817 bushels were exported in 1926 valued at 30,111l. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1926 was valued at 1,837l. 1,522,700 dried conchs (shell fish), value 1,523l. were shipped, all but 1,000, to Haiti, in 1926.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st Dec., 1926, 37 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,059 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 78°, the extreme range being from 60° to 93°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1926 amounted to 40·61 inches, the average rainfall during the five years 1922-1926 was 23·13 inches.
Means of Communication.

The Clyde Line of New York, U.S.A., maintain a mail, passenger and freight service calling at Grand Turk every three weeks north bound only from Santo Domingo direct for New York, the length of passage from Grand Turk being five days. Passengers travelling to the Turks Islands from New York by this line must go to Santo Domingo first and the length of passage is twelve days.

The Columbus Line of New York call at Grand Turk at least once a month from New York for Santo Domingo and north bound from Santo Domingo for New York bringing and carrying mails and freight.

Steamers of the Royal Netherlands West India Mail, trading between New York and South America, now call at Grand Turk about twice a month for stewedores and call again on the return voyage to land them. These ships bring mails and passengers from New York but no cargo.

The Elders and Ryffes Line make occasional calls on their way to Jamaica when passengers offer and on such occasions take mails to Jamaica.

There is a telephone exchange at Grand Turk with 40 connections.

The rate of letter postage is 2½d. per ounce to all British Possessions; 2½d. to the U.S.A., and to all other countries 3½d. per ounce.

Cable communication with Bermuda and Jamaica was established by the Direct West India Cable Company in January, 1898, the station being at Grand Turk. The rates are per word: To England 2s. 4½d., to Jamaica 1s., to Halifax 1s. 6½d.

A new cable was laid in 1924 connecting Grand Turk with Barbados.

Communication between Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the Turks Islands and Cockburn Harbour has been established by wireless telephone. The station at Grand Turk is also a telegraphic one with a sending range of about 500 miles.

Education.

In 1921 a secondary school was opened at Grand Turk and controlled by a Board of Management appointed by the Commissioner. This school receives an annual government grant of £150, and other revenue is derived from school fees.

There are ten elementary schools supported by Government, with 886 pupils enrolled in 1926 and an average attendance of 670. The schools are entirely unsectarian and free.

During 1924 a Centre for the Cambridge Local Examinations was established at Grand Turk.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of five shillings, ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1926, 878 depositors, with 22,621l. deposits.

Constitution.

By Jamaica Law No. 6 of 1926 which came into operation on the 1st day of August 1926, the Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner, who by virtue of his office is President, and seven other persons, three of whom are holders of offices under the Crown, appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.
