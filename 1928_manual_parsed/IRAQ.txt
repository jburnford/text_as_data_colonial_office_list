IRAQ.

Iraq, in the sense in which the name is used now, is that part of the former Ottoman Empire which stretches from Fao on the Persian Gulf to the junction of the Rivers Tigris and Khabur. It comprises the vilayets of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul.

The area of Iraq is 116,511 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Turkish frontier, which was defined in a treaty between the United Kingdom, Iraq and Turkey, signed at Angora on June 5th, 1926. On the east, it is bounded by Persia. The frontier, the delimitation of which was completed by a Turko-Persian Commission in 1914, runs in the north through, and in the southern portion skirts, the Kurdish mountains which form the western edge of the Persian plateau, and descends 10 miles above Mohammerah to the Shatt-al-Arab, the river formed by the union of the Euphrates and the Tigris. On the south, Iraq is bounded by the Persian Gulf, the territory of Kuwait and the Nejd frontier as defined in a protocol to the Mohammerah Treaty between Iraq and Nejd, signed at Uqair in December, 1922; and on the south-west and west by the deserts of northern Arabia and Syria. On the north-west, the boundary between Iraq and Syria was provisionally settled by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920. It runs from the Tigris at Falashkhabur to Albu Kamal on the Euphrates, and thence across the desert to Iltmar, south of Jabal Druz. Apart from the hill country in the north-east, Iraq mainly consists of great plains traversed by the Euphrates and the Tigris. The country between these rivers is divided into two parts. The southern portion, stretching from Baghdad to Basra is a great alluvial plain about 35,000 square miles in area with a fertile soil wherever the land can be irrigated without being drowned. A considerable extent of it is, however, covered by marshes formed by the uncontrolled action of the rivers and canals. The northern portion known as Jazirah or "the Island," is more undulating, and is in places broken by ranges of hills. It is fertile under irrigation in the north, but further south the plains become more arid until it passes into a hard desert tract.

The climate of Iraq is of the continental sub-tropical type, with very high temperatures in summer in the plains. In July and August the mean daily maximum temperature is 104° F. at Basra, and 110° F. at Baghdad, while in December and January the mean daily minimum temperature is 47° F. at Basra and 40° F. at Baghdad. The rainy season is from November to March. There is a rainless summer of six months lasting from about April to September. The Mosul area has a rainfall of about 13 inches a year and relies on the rain to grow its crops. The rest of the country, however, has an annual rainfall of only about seven inches, and the crops are grown, with very little help from the rain, on irrigated land.

The chief towns are Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Karbala, and Najaf. The two last, situated on the edge of the Arabian desert, are pilgrim centres which attract Shi'as from all parts of the Mohammedan world, but especially from Persia and India.

Population.

According to a census taken in 1920 the population numbers 2,849,282, made up as follows:

|                | Sunni   | Shi'ah | Jewish | Christian | Other Religions | Total    |
|----------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Basra Vilayet  | 42,558  | 721,414| 10,088 | 2,551     | 8,989           | 785,600  |
| Baghdad Vilayet | 524,414 | 750,421| 62,565 | 20,771    | 2,133           | 1,360,304|
| *Mosul Vilayet | 579,713 | 22,180 | 14,835 | 55,470    | 31,180          | 703,378  |
| Total          | 1,146,685| 1,494,015| 87,488 | 78,792    | 42,302          | 2,849,282|

* The figures for Mosul include the population of the Kurdish area of Sulaimaniya, viz., 155,000, of whom all but 1,100 are Sunnis.

Natural Products.

The chief articles of export from Iraq before the war were dates, wool and barley. Dates and wool have continued to be exported, but the export of barley fell almost to nothing, mainly because of the purchases made by the British military authorities in Iraq, but is now beginning to revive. Round Mosul the prevailing crop is wheat, but all the wheat grown is consumed in the country. Rice, in most cases "red" rice of inferior quality, is grown on the swampy lands on the Middle Euphrates, in the Amara area on the Tigris, and to a small extent, on the Diyala canals near Baghdad. Rice of better quality but in very small quantities is grown in the Kurdish hills.

In the Kurdish regions round Sulaimaniya and Ruwandiz and to the north of Mosul tobacco is an important crop. The crop is hardly sufficient for local requirements. None is exported.
In all parts of Iraq cotton can be grown. Experiments carried out since the occupation of Baghdad in 1917 tend to show that Iraqi cotton compares favourably with cotton grown in other parts of the world. Production has slowly but steadily increased since the war; according to figures given from the ginnery at Baghdad of the British Cotton Growing Association of Manchester, the 1926 crop exceeded 3,500 bales.

Wool is exported in considerable quantities. The principal sheep rearing districts are the Mosul area and the Kurdish hills.

Concessions for the exploitation of the oil resources of Iraq have been granted to the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The former concession covers the whole country with the exception of the old Vilayat of Basra and of the area on the N.E. frontier transferred from Persia to Turkey in 1913-14 which is known as the Transferred Territories. The Turkish Petroleum Company began comprehensive prospecting in the Autumn of 1925 and during 1927 inaugurated eight drills in seven different areas. One "gusher" was struck and capped. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession is confined to the Transferred Territories and is an adaption of the D'Arcy Concession held by the company from the Persian Government, which the Turkish Government and later the Iraqi Government agreed should continue in the Transferred Territories where the company has been prospecting for many years. Since the war oil has been struck near Khanqin and the field is considered a promising one. The Anglo-Persian Subsidiary, the Khanqin Oil Company, have opened a refinery near to Khanqin town which produces sufficient petrol, kerosine and crude oil for the needs of Iraq.

Minor products are millet, licorice root, gall-nuts, gum and dye-roots.

Railways.

The railways open to traffic are—

Metre Gauge.

1. Basra—Baghdad with branches to Nasiriya and Karbala.
2. Baghdad—Khanqin (approximately 7 miles from the Persian frontier) with a branch line to Kirkuk.

In all, 624 miles of open line and 796 miles track mileage.

Standard Gauge (4ft. 8½in.).

3. Baghdad—Samarra—Baizi 132 miles of open line and 211 miles track mileage.

There is a gap of 124 miles between the Mesopotamian railhead at Baizi and Mosul; and the Baghdad Railway comes down to Nisibin, about 110 miles from Mosul. Thus railway communication between Constantinople and Basra, via Aleppo, Mosul and Baghdad is complete except for a gap of less than 240 miles.

General.

About 75 miles of the Baghdad-Samarra-Baizi line, were built by the Baghdad Railway Company before the war. The remainder of the system was made by the British authorities during and since the war, with the exception of the following lines which have been constructed under the administration of the Iraq Government:—

Karbala branch ... ... 2250 miles.
Kirkuk branch ... ... 7730 ...
Basra City extension ... ... 272 ...

Government.

The war left Iraq in British occupation; and on March 2nd, 1921, the supervision of the affairs of Iraq was transferred to the Colonial Office.

At the Conference of April, 1920, at San Remo, the principal Allied Powers decided that Iraq should be assigned under mandate to the United Kingdom.

On October 3rd, 1921, the President of the Council of the League of Nations wrote to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom expressing on behalf of the Council the hope that the Mandatory Powers (England and France) would continue to carry on the administration of the territories detached from Turkey in the spirit of the draft mandates until such time as the position should have been definitely regularised.

By the Treaty of Peace with Turkey signed at Lausanne on July 24th, 1923, Turkey renounced all rights over Iraq.

The conception of a mandate proved to be inappropriate in the case of Iraq, where an independent sovereign government has been recognized by His Majesty's Government. The relations between Great Britain and Iraq were accordingly placed upon a treaty basis in 1922, and the Treaty of Alliance with Protocol and Subsidiary Agreements were ratified and came into force on 19th December, 1924.

The Council of the League of Nations by their decision of 27th September, 1924, accepted these instruments as giving effect to the provisions of Article 22 of the Covenant as far as Iraq was concerned.

In Turkish times each of the three Vilayets was governed by a Vali, who received orders directly from Constantinople. The official hierarchy, in descending order of importance, was:—

Vali ... in charge of Vilayet.
Mutasarrif ... Liwa.
Qaimmaqam ... Qadha.
Mudir ... Nahiyah.

As Iraq came under British control, as a result of the military operations of 1914-1918, British Political Officers took over the administration of liwas and qadhass, working under the orders of the Chief Political Officer (later the Civil Commissioner). This system was modified when Sir Percy Cox was appointed High Commissioner. When he took up his post in the autumn of 1920, he organised a provisional native Government composed of a Council of Arab Ministers which was presided over by the Naqib of Baghdad. On August 23rd, 1921, the Sharif Faisal, third son of the King of the Hejaz was proclaimed King of Iraq, by virtue of a referendum to the people, which resulted in his election by 96%. The government of the country is thus vested in an Iraq Government, the King being advised by the British High Commissioner, while each Ministry has a British Adviser attached to it. Every Liwa is administered by a native Mutasarrif, who is assisted by a British Inspector.

On October 10th, 1922, the High Commissioner and the Naqib signed a treaty to regulate the relations between His Majesty's Government and the Government of Iraq. This treaty was for a term of 20 years. The Naqib resigned office in November, and a new cabinet, mainly composed of ministers who had previously served under him was formed under the Presidency of 'Abdul Muhsin Beg al Sa'dun. On April 30th, 1923, a Protocol, reducing the period of the Treaty to a
maximum of 4 years from the date of ratification of peace with Turkey, was signed at Baghdad. In November, 1923, this Cabinet fell and was succeeded by one under the Presidency of Ja'far Pasha el 'Askeri.

Under this Cabinet general elections were held and the Constituent Assembly met at the end of March, 1924, and sat until August 2, when it had completed the duties for which it was summoned, namely, to approve the Treaty and pass Organic and Electoral Laws. Ja'far Pasha then resigned and a new Cabinet was formed under Yasin Pasha al Hashimi. On the 27th September, 1924, the Council of the League of Nations accepted the Treaty, Protocol and certain agreements subsidiary thereto as giving effect to Art. 22 of the Covenant. These instruments entered into force on the 19th December, 1924.

Yasin Pasha was succeeded as Prime Minister by 'Abdul Muhsin Beg al Sa'dun who took office with a new cabinet on June 26th, 1925. The first Iraq Parliament was opened by King Faisal on July 16th. Parliament consists of the King, a Senate of 20 members appointed by the King and a Chamber of Deputies of 88 members elected by manhood suffrage.

The subsequent ministries will be found below. A new treaty, providing for the continuance in force of the 1922 treaty until the admission of Iraq to membership of the League, subject to a maximum period of 25 years, was signed on the 13th of January, 1926, at Baghdad. It was subsequently accepted by the Iraq Parliament, and was approved by the British House of Commons on 18th February, 1926.

On 14th December, 1927, a new treaty was signed in London by Mr. W. Ormsby Gore, M.P., and the Prime Minister of Iraq to regulate the future relations of the Government of Great Britain and the Government of Iraq. It replaced the treaties of 10th October, 1922, and 13th January, 1926, by provisions more appropriate to the existing circumstances.
