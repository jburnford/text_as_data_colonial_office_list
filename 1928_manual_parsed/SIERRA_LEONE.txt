SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The territory known as the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone is an area of some 27,250 square miles, roughly circular in shape, lying between 6° 55' and 10° N. lat., and 10° 20' and 13° 25' of W. long. The sea coast, 210 miles in length, extends from Kiragba at about lat. 9° N., on the border of French Guinea, to the Mano River at lat. 6° 55' N. on the border of the Republic of Liberia.

The Colony portion of this area, i.e. the territories acquired by the Crown by Treaty of Cession or otherwise consists of the following:—the Sierra Leone Peninsula in which is situated Freetown (the seat of Government), Sherbro Island, the islands of Tasso, Bananas, Turtles, York, Buns, Shaye and other small islets, the Lower Lokko and Matoki Chiefdoms in the Northern Province, and the Bumpe, Kagboro, Bagru, Mano Bagru, Timdel, Bendu, Cha, Mongoba Bullon, Meesi Krim, and part of the Manosa Krim Chiefdoms in the Southern Province. The Crown has also acquired a strip of land, varying in depth from a quarter of a mile to one mile throughout the whole coast line not included in the areas specified above. Of these areas the Peninsula of Sierra Leone, Tasso Island, Banana Islands, York Island, and the township of Bonthe in Sherbro Island, only, are administered as strictly Colony; the other areas are administered as part of the Protectorate.

History.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Nembanba and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor, of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs, and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government." This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 22nd August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who from various circumstances had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the Colony was used as a settlement for Africans rescued from slave-ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves. The territory of the Colony received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on the 10th July, 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the Colony; and in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Kwai, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Kwai country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the Treaty of Cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with various Chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. This treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other Treaties of Cession were made from time to time.

On August 21st, 1896, a Proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the Hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate, which, by Order-in-Council No. 11 of 1920, and subsequent amending orders, is divided into three Provinces as follows:—

Northern Province Districts.—Port Loko, Karene, Bombali, Kambia, Koinadugu and Ronietta.

Central Province Districts.—Moyamba, Kono, Kenema, Panguma and Pendembu.

Southern Province Districts.—Shebar, Sembehun and Gbangbama, Sumbuya, Pujehun and Mano River.

By Order-in-Council No. 8 of 1925, dated 5th October, 1925, parts of the Port Loko and Bombali Districts of the Northern Province were constituted a new District, called the Ronietta District.

General Description.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of volcanic mountains, running parallel to the sea from N.W. to S.S.E., the summits of which, in the Picket Hill, Sugar Loaf and Leicester Mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of novite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The parts on the banks of the rivers are low and swampy, while away from the rivers the country consists of low rolling downs, with here and there, in the northern portion, a range of hills some 3,000 feet in height. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa, the country is well watered by rivers and streams. The principal rivers which empty themselves into the Atlantic on the Sierra Leone Coast are the Great and Little Scarcies, the Sierra Leone or Rokell, the Sherbro, the Jong, the Manneh or Mano, the Ribbi, Bum, Kittam, and Moa, most of which are navigable for several miles.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 2,900 feet above the sea. In 1921 it contained 44,142 inhabitants. It possesses the best harbour in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining have a population (including Freetown and its Districts) of 88,163. It yields only a small quantity of exportable commodities, but ginger and coffee thrive if well looked after. The extent of the territory is, however, small (256 square miles), and the generally rocky soil is not very well adapted for cultivation.

Considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piaassava, with other articles of lesser importance are exported via Bonthe in the Southern Province.

Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, coco-
made fresh provision for the appointment of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and instruc-

imports are tobacco, cotton goods, etc., and hardware.
The Protectorate covers an area of about 27,200 square miles, lying between the Niger and the Benue Rivers, and extending from the River Niger to the Atlantic Ocean.

The Protectorate comprises the territories of Nigeria and its dependencies (the Lagos Colony, the Sapele Division, and the Niger Delta). It also includes the Timbuktu District in the north-western quadrant of the country, and several coastal areas above the mouth of the Niger River.

There is a saloon at New John's Point, "Mississippi," which is settled by people from Britain who have described coming to this place in order to make their living by means of trade and commerce.

The Protectorate was originally intended for a settlement of Europeans who came from various parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. The English settlers brought with them various territories and chiefdoms, among which was the Farin Province, which they claimed to be lying within the Protectorate in 1861.

Chief Abutu, in the west of the protectorate, for the purpose of adding these three territories of the Colony. This Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, coco-
nuts, bene seed, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, cacao, rice, and other tropical products. No minerals have been discovered, except iron, which can hardly be reckoned as of exportable value.

The population of the Protectorate was in 1921 estimated at 1,456,148 and is composed of the following tribes:

Northern Province { Temnes, Limbas, Susus, Lokkos, Fulahs, Mandingoes, Korankos, Yalunkas.
Central Province { Mendes, Sherbros, Konnohs, a few Kissis.
Southern Province { Mendes, Krima, Sherbros, Gallinas, Golas and Vais.

Constitution.

A Charter, issued on May 27th, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, established a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, revoked so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter, dated 17th of December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent dated 17th June, 1886, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. By letters patent, dated 3rd April, 1913, and Royal Instructions, dated 4th May, 1922, there were constituted an Executive Council composed of the Officer in command of the troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and a Legislative Council, composed of the members of the Executive Council and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On March 7, 1913, an Imperial Order-in-Council was issued providing for the administration of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The Order applies to the territories, not being portions of the Colony of Sierra Leone, lying between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude and the tenth and fourteenth degrees of west longitude, and beginning at the extreme southerly point of the Colony on the Anglo-Liberian boundary, as delimited under the provisions of the Anglo-Liberian Conventions, November 11, 1885, and January 21, 1911.

The Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of Sierra Leone is also the Governor of the Protectorate. Authority is given to the Governor by Ordinances passed in the Legislative Council to exercise and provide for giving effect to the powers and jurisdiction acquired by the Crown in Sierra Leone.

Letters Patent, dated the 28th January, 1924, revoked those issued on the 3rd April, 1913, and made fresh provision for the appointment of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and instructions issued under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet on the same date cancelled those of the 3rd April, 1913, and 4th May, 1922. An Order of the King in Council dated the 16th January, 1924, provided for a new and considerably enlarged Legislative Council, introducing an elective element and direct representation of Protectorate interests into the constitution of that Council for the first time in the history of Sierra Leone.

Climate.

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The shade temperature varies during the year from about 62° to 97°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur at the commencement and close of the rainy season. They are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp. The rainfall in Freetown for the year 1924 was 149-67 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from N.E. to S.E.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is trying, but conditions have been greatly improved in recent years through the efforts of the Medical and Sanitary Services, and if ordinary precautions are taken the risk of contracting malarial fever can be much reduced. Conditions at "Hill Station," Freetown, where most headquarters officials, and a few unofficials, reside, are exceptionally good.

Vegetable Products.

The principal products exported from Sierra Leone are palm kernels, palm oil, bene seed (sesame), ground nuts, kola nuts, ginger and hides. The chief agricultural work lies in the cultivation of rice and cassava for local consumption. The kola tree is found near almost every village, and from its product a considerable portion of the revenue of the native inhabitants is derived. Gum copal and maize are also produced.

Trade.

The inhabitants of Freetown and the Colony generally are traders and shop-keepers, and do little in the way of agriculture beyond the planting of cassava. In the Protectorate the inhabitants plant "farms," chiefly of rice and cassava, and collect natural products for sale to the various merchants and traders of the Colony. They also weave "country cloths," many of which are of a good texture and handsome design. There is also a flourishing industry of mat making, basket making, etc., and in the Northern Province, a certain amount of ornate leather work is produced. The fishing industry at Sherbro is of considerable importance, vast quantities of dried fish being taken inland.

The staple food of the inhabitants is rice and foofoo made from cassava.

The products from the Protectorate which constitute the principal exports are palm kernels, palm oil, kola nuts, piassava, pepper, hides and ginger. The British Cotton Growing Association made an experiment in cotton growing on European principles, which was not successful, chiefly owing to the withering effect of the harmattan wind, but local varieties of cotton are successfully grown in considerable quantities. The principal imports are tobacco, cotton goods, spirits, furniture, groceries, etc., and hardware.
Currency and Banking.

Besides English currency, West Africa silver coins (2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d.) were put into circulation in 1913, and alloy coins of similar denominations in 1920. Currency Notes of the value of 20s. and 10s. were introduced in 1916 and of 2s. in 1917, and 1s. in 1919, but the last two denominations are not now current. The Bank of British West Africa has two branches in the Colony and some agencies in the Protectorate. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial & Overseas) Ltd. also is established in Freetown. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882, and had invested by the end of 1926 the sum of £2,129.

Education.

The number of schools on the assisted list in 1926 was 139. Fifteen schools were maintained wholly from public funds, making a total of 154. Of these 139 were primary, 2 industrial and 13 secondary. At the end of 1926 the enrolment number was 13,333. Education is not compulsory. The Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Mission have a college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University. A scheme for the education, on Western lines, of Mohammedan children was started in 1901. There are now five Mohammedan Schools or Madrasas in Freetown, with 676 pupils on the roll in 1926. A Government school for the sons and nominees of native chiefs was established at Bo in the Kenema District of the Protectorate on 1st March, 1906, under European supervision. The number of pupils at the close of the year 1926 was 157. There is also a Government Model School in Freetown at which 216 pupils attended in 1926.

An agricultural training college for vernacular teachers was established in 1919 at Njala in the Protectorate; 94 pupils were enrolled in 1926. There are also eight Government Rural schools in the Protectorate, with an attendance of 341 pupils.

The total number of children being instructed in the Government and assisted Mission Schools in the Colony and Protectorate was as follows:

- Primary Schools: 11,024
- Prince of Wales' School: 81
- Secondary Schools: 833
- Bo School: 157
- Government Model School: 216
- Njala School: 94
- Government Rural Schools (Colony): 464
- Do. do. do. (Protectorate): 341
- Industrial Schools: 133

Total: 13,333

Means of Communication.

Steamers leave Liverpool for Freetown, and Freetown for Plymouth and Liverpool, about three times a month. The passage takes about 10 days.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively. A wireless telegraphic station was opened in 1913. The main line of the Sierra Leone Government Railway, which was the first Railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the Freetown terminus to Pendembu in the Railway District, a distance of 22½ miles. The number of stations and flag stations is 53. From Boia Junction, 64½ miles from Freetown, a branch line runs to Kamabai, a distance of 104 miles.

There are 1,269 miles of combined telegraph and telephone lines in operation. The gauge of the Railway is 2 ft. 6 in. There are about 120 miles of motorable roads in the Protectorate and the main thoroughfares in Freetown and its vicinity are motorable.

There is another line, known as the Mountain Railway, which connects Freetown with Hill Station, 5 miles, 59 chains distant.

There are also lines connecting the terminus with the Government Wharf, Government Quarry, Ascension Town Cemetery, and the Recreation Ground.

The total railway receipts for 1926 were £28,527.; the working expenses for the same year were £75,392.

The Sherbro river is navigable for over 20 miles (up to York Island), the Sierra Leone, or Rokell river, for 40 miles (as far as Magbile).

For six months of the year the Kittam River is navigable for launches to Mopaima (about 80 miles) all the year and for 6 months to Pujahun. Much of the produce from the Northern Sherbro District is thus transported to Bonteh.

There are 69 post offices and postal agencies. The estimated number of letters, &c., handled in 1926 was 1,777,783; of parcels 40,636, of which the Inland Post dealt with 915,316 and 13,667 respectively.

SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE.

In 1884, a Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali Coast, extending from Lahadu (Loyi-ada), half-way between Ras Jibouti and Zeyla, to the 49th meridian E.long. The boundary has been settled by agreements with France, Italy, and King Menelik of Abyssinia. Till 1898, the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden, as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year, it was transferred to the charge of the Foreign Office, and on 1st April, 1906, to that of the Colonial Office. The chief ports are Berbera, Bulhar, and Zeyla. Area about 68,000 square miles.

Exports consist of skins and hides, sheep and cattle, gums, ostrich feathers, and salt.
Imports consist of rice, dates, cotton piece goods and shirtings, iron and hardware.
All transport is by animals. There is a weekly steamer service with Aden.

For Scales A to F, see footnote on page 414.
The climate at the coast is trying for Europeans, but is comparatively healthy in the interior, where an elevation of from 4,500 feet to 6,800 feet is reached.

The Haud waterless plains constitute the principal pastures of the country. The chief source of wealth of the people lies in their live stock.

In the beginning of 1901, operations were commenced against a fanatical Somali leader, the Mullah Mohammed Abdullah, and a native levy with British Officers, under Captain (local Lieut.-Colonel) E. J. E. Swayne, Indian Army, penetrated into the Nogal Valley. After defeating the Mullah at Somals and Fordiddin, and killing 1,200 men and taking 600 prisoners, he drove him into Italian territory.

The dervishes afterwards gathered together again, and a similar expedition, strengthened by the 2nd King's African Rifles (Yao), was despatched under Colonel Swayne in the summer of 1902, and again drove the Mullah into Italian territory with heavy loss, but met with a severe check in Italian territory at Erego, on October 6th. The Mullah, however, retired as the result of this action still further into Italian territory, to Geladi.

Five months later a third expedition, co-operating with the Abyssinian Army, under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel (local Brigadier-General) W. H. Manning, Insp.-General K.A. Rifles, comprising British and Boer M.I., Indian and African troops, with the main base at Obbia in Italian Somaliland, proceeded to Mudug, thence detaching a force under Lieut.-Colonel Cobbe, V.C., to Geladi, which place was up till then the head-quarters of the enemy. A force of 200 Yao and Sikha, under the late Lieut.-Colonel Plunkett, was overwhelmed at Gumburru, in April, 1903, after a fight of the fiercest description. A column of 200 men under Major Gough, was at the same time attacked at Daratoleh, whence it retired fighting to Bobotleh, and in June the expedition fell back on the Berbera-Bohotleh lines of communication, when Lieut.-General Sir C. C. Egerton, K.C.B., was placed in command.

Reinforcements, increasing the force to 7,000 rifles, were despatched and placed in the field, and in January, 1904, 3,250 troops defeated 5,000 dervishes at Jidballi, about 1,000 of the latter being killed.

In March, 1905, an agreement was concluded between the Italian Government and the Mullah Seyyid Mahommmed, whereby peace was declared between the dervishes and the neighbouring tribes, both those subject to the Government of Italy and those under the protection of the British Government. The Mullah was given a port on the east coast and was assigned certain territories within the Italian sphere of interest, beyond which he and his dervishes undertook not to encroach.

In the latter part of 1908, some unrest was caused by the unfriendly attitude of the Mullah, and reinforcements were brought into the Protectorate from East Africa, Uganda, Nyasaland, and India during 1909.

Subsequently, arrangements were made to arm the friendly tribes to enable them to defend themselves against attack, and in March, 1910, all troops were withdrawn from the interior; the 6th Battalion King's African Rifles was disbanded, and a policy of strict coastal concentration was then adopted. This policy having disappointed expectations, a Camel Constabulary, 150 strong, under the command of the late Mr. R. C. Cordfeld, was raised at the end of 1912 to check inter-tribal fighting, which by this time had assumed serious proportions. A measure of peace among the friendly tribes was quickly restored, but in August, 1913, the Corps, at a strength of 109 rank and file, encountered at Dulmadoba a raiding party of dervishes estimated at 2,000 rifles, and in the action which ensued, though heavy losses were inflicted on the enemy, the Constabulary sustained casualties amounting to 50%, including the Commandant, killed. The force thereupon fell back on Sheikh, and reinforcements of Indian Infantry were moved up from the coast. His Majesty's Government later decided to increase the forces of the Protectorate in order to preserve the necessary grazing grounds of the friendlies from dervish attack, and to maintain peace among the tribes living in the west.

In November, 1914, Military Headquarters were established at Burao, 80 miles from the coast. At this time the Dervishes were in occupation of the Ain Valley, which is one of the principal grazing grounds of the friendlies. Strong forts had been constructed by the Mullah at Jidali and Shimber Berris and these were used as forward bases for raids against our tribes. The position at Shimber Berris was accordingly attacked by the local troops under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Cubitt, D.S.O., and after a stubborn resistance all the forts were finally captured and blown up. In 1914 the Dervishes made serious raids and their aggressions went on during the war, but early in 1920 operations against them were carried out by air attacks followed up by mounted forces with infantry supports. These operations were completely successful, the power of the Dervishes was completely destroyed, and the Mullah became a fugitive in Abyssinian territory; he died there in 1921. Since 1923 the condition of the country has been peaceful and as a result the stock wealth of the native population has largely increased while in the western areas the development of agriculture has made great progress. A geological survey of the Protectorate has been made which has shown some areas of promise.
