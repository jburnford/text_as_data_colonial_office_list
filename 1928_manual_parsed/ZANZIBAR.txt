ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is 53 miles long by 24 broad (maximum measurements), and has an area of 640 square miles. To the north-east at a distance of some twenty-five miles lies the island of Pemba, in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 42 miles long by 14 broad (maximum measurements), and having an area of 390 square miles.

Climate.

The annual rainfall amounts approximately in Zanzibar to 66 inches and in Pemba to 75 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined; the heavy rains occur in April and May previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The mean maximum temperature in Zanzibar is 84° F. and the mean minimum 76° F. The corresponding figures for Pemba are 83° 6' and 73° 2' respectively.

People.

The Arabs were the conquerors of the islands. They founded the clove industry and still possess considerable property in plantations. They understand the natives and the natives understand them and accept their control and that of Europeans more readily than that of other races.

The bulk of the native population numbering 186,000 is known by the generic name of Swahili, a term formerly used to denote the Bantu coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "swahili" in Arabic meaning "coasts." This general appellation includes the descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar who intermarried with negro women. They are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern and southern portions of the islands. A quiet shy people, occupied mainly in the cultivation of native crops and fishing, they rarely move from their homes except to pick cloves. The name Swahili also includes the descendants of the early settlers in Pemba who are known as Wapemba. These people engage chiefly in agriculture but raise a smaller variety of native crops than the Wahadimu. Many of them own clove and coconut plantations. They live in less seclusion than the natives on the larger island. Another tribe included in the term are the Watumbatu whose chief stronghold is Tumbatu Island. They are a very exclusive people but by no means shy. They go down to the sea and man most of the craft plying in Zanzibar waters.

There is in addition a considerable influx of various tribes from the mainland, of whom the Wanyamwezi are economically the most important, being now the chief source of supply for the weeding of plantations.

The non-native population numbers 31,000 of whom 16,500 are Arabs. The Khojas, Bohoras, Hindoos, Parsees and Goans possess most of the trade, either as merchants, shopkeepers, money-lenders, small traders or skilled mechanics.

History.

The beginnings of Zanzibar history are lost in antiquity. It appears more than probable that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were known to the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians and Jews, but though the expedition of Necho
(C. 600 B.C.) doubtless passed the Islands it is not till the first century that the Periplus gives a description of one of them under the name of Menuthias. The Hindus appear to have settled at a very early date and traces of Greek colonisation are not lacking. From about the 7th Century B.C. the Islands appear to have had a close connection with the South Arabian States. Bantu settlers probably made their appearance during the first five centuries A.D., and thereafter for the next five hundred years or so came also traders from China and Malaya in addition to those from the Persian Gulf. The Coast was probably converted to Islam early in the 10th Century. The Zenj Empire was founded by Ali bin Hassan, a prince of Shiraz, about 975 A.D. but it soon broke up into separate states and, by the time the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral, was already declining. It was during the sixteenth century that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa Fort in 1598 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by transferring his capital from Muscat and making the island his permanent residence in the year 1832. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "all Africa as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain, and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000L. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000L.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the British Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized the Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

The Government was vested in a High Commissioner, who was also Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate, and a British Resident. A Protectorate Council, with His Highness as President, was established at the same time. It was of an advisory and consultative nature and ceased to exist in 1926 when Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted.

During the Great War a European Defence Force and a Native Carrier Corps were raised and many natives enlisted in the King's African Rifles. Zanzibar contributed £70,000 to the Imperial Government and £245,000 was invested in War Loan. £19,000 was raised by public subscription for the British Red Cross Society.

Since the War the principal event has been the abolition of the High Commissionership in 1926. During the last few years great progress has been made in Education and the provision of improved means of transport. Much attention has been directed to the regeneration of the clove industry.

**Industries and Trade.**

Zanzibar is now the dominant partner in the clove industry, holding as it does about 93% of the shares. The other partners are Penang, Amboyna and some other islands in the East Indian Archipelago, and Madagascar.

Authorities differ as to the date when and country from which the clove tree was first introduced into Zanzibar. Some say that it was brought from Réunion by an Arab at the end of the 18th century. Colonel Rigby, Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, in his report on the Zanzibar dominions written in the year 1860, states "the first clove trees were introduced about 30 years ago from Mauritius; being found to thrive they were extensively planted and they have now become the most valuable production of these Islands."

To Seyyid Said belongs the credit of establishing and promoting the clove industry. Burton records that he threatened confiscation to those who did not plant three clove trees for every coconut and that the country was almost denuded of the latter to make room for cloves. In 1839-40 the output amounted to about 9,000 frasilas. (The Frasila, equivalent to 35 lbs., is the local measure of weight for cloves). In 1849 it had risen to frasilas 120,000. In 1859 frasilas 139,000, valued at 55,666L, were exported, and the average output during the next decade was frasilas 200,000, valued at about 85,000L. Owing to the increase in production the price had, however, fallen from $5-86 to $1-92.

In 1872, a hurricane of great violence swept over the Island of Zanzibar and destroyed two-thirds of the clove and coconut trees. Pemba, though touched by the hurricane, sustained little damage. The years following this disaster were years of short supply, high prices and intensive cultivation. The Pemba owners, actuated by motives of gain, hastened to cut down coconut trees on a wholesale scale throughout the island and to plant clove trees in their place. The Zanzibar owners, though temporarily ruined, set to work with commendable fortitude to replace the trees which the hurricane had destroyed, and ten years after the hurricane the normal output of cloves had not only been restored but increased.
Another event of great economic importance to the industry was the abolition of slavery. The industry was built up and for many years sustained on slave labour imported from the interior of Africa. In 1873 Seyyid Barghash entered into a treaty to suppress the sea-borne traffic in slaves and to close all public markets in his dominions for the buying or selling of imported slaves. Various treaties and legislative measures followed until the year 1897, when by a decree of Seyyid Hamoud the legal status of slavery was abolished. It may be noted parenthetically that in the year 1890 Great Britain assumed a protectorate over Zanzibar.

The history of labour subsequent to 1897 is a tale of shortage, disinclination on the part of the labour available to engage in any form of settled work, inability or disinclination on the part of the Arabs to pay money wages, and administrative effort to organize the available supply. The introduction of Indian labour was at one time or another canvassed but never materialized. In 1904 and 1906 and at other subsequent times recourse was had to recruitment of labour on the mainland. Mainlanders have also come voluntarily, settled in appreciable numbers, and are now the chief source of supply for cultivation of plantations. The situation has also doubtless been eased by the gradual passing of much property in plantations from Arabs to natives.

Since abolition of slavery no event of major economic consequence has occurred. There have been the usual ups and downs, but production has steadily increased.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both Islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 45,000 acres under cultivation and 3 million trees in both Islands. The export of domestic copra, which is steadily increasing, amounted to 17,354 tons in 1926. Much is produced by the small grower or trader, neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Cochin and Ceylon.

The principal re-exports are rice and other grains, copra, ivory, and piece-goods.

The chief imports are fish (dried), ghee, rice, flour and other grains, groceries, sugar, tobacco, coal, copra, hides and skins, ivory, bags, sesame, petroleum, and piece-goods.

Currency and Banking.

The silver rupee of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, is the standard coin of Zanzibar. All other silver coins of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. These coins are \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{4} \), and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a rupee. Seyyidieh copper pice are legal tender at the rate of 64 pice to 1 rupee for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. There is a Government note issue of the denominations Rupees 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500.

The National Bank of India, Ltd., and the Standard Bank of South Africa have branches in Zanzibar.

Shipping and Communications.

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of trans-shipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast. Recent figures, nevertheless, tend to indicate that the Island will continue, by reason of its geographical position, to retain control of the local traffic.

The British India Steam Navigation Company maintain a monthly service between London—Zanzibar—Beira, the Union Castle Mail Steamship Company a monthly service London—Zanzibar—London round Africa in alternate directions, the Clan—Ellerman—Harrison Line between Glasgow—Liverpool—Zanzibar—Beira (cargo only), the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes a fortnightly service Marseilles—Zanzibar—Madagascar, the German East Africa Line a monthly service Hamburg—Zanzibar—Hamburg round Africa in alternate directions, the Holland Africa Line a fortnightly service Rotterdam—Zanzibar—Rotterdam round Africa in alternate directions, the Compagnia Italiana Transatlantica a monthly service between Genoa and Zanzibar. The British India Steam Navigation Company also maintain a fortnightly service Bombay—Zanzibar—Durban, also a coastal service Lamu—Zanzibar—Mikindani, the Osaka Shosen Kaisha a monthly service Kobe—Zanzibar—Durban. Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw & Bros., maintain a fortnightly service between Zanzibar and Kisimayu. The Government possesses two steamers which maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba and Dar-es-Salaam. Zanzibar has become a port of call in the itinerary of a number of large tourist steamers.

There is cable communication with Europe either via Aden or via Durban.

There are 120 miles of roads throughout the Island of Zanzibar and 50 miles in Pemba suitable for motor traffic. The Government maintains wireless stations in Zanzibar and Pemba and a telephone system in the town of Zanzibar which is connected with the District and Agricultural Stations in the country. A light railway runs north from the town to Bububu, 7 miles distant.

There are 7 post offices in the two Islands.

Constitution and Government.

The Government is administered by a British Resident, who is appointed by commission under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1924 and 1925.

Legislation consists of the Decrees of the Sultan, and certain Imperial Statutes of general application. Many Indian Acts, such as Penal Code, Civil and Criminal Procedure, etc., have been adapted to local requirements and enacted in the form of Decrees. His Highness's decrees when countersigned by the British Resident under Article 42 of the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are binding upon all persons. The Muhammadan Law, declared in civil matters to be the fundamental law of His Highness's Dominions, controls in some measure personal relationship and land tenure among the Islamic population.

There are Executive and Legislative Councils, established by the Sultan's Decree No. 1 of 1926. The former is presided over by H.H. the Sultan, and the latter by the British Resident.
are three other ex-officio official members and five nominated. There are six unofficial members representing the various communities.

Justice, in cases in which persons subject to the Zanzibar Orders-in-Council, 1924 and 1925, are concerned, is administered by H.B.M.'s High Court and the Courts subordinate to it, and in other cases by H.H. the Sultan's Court for Zanzibar and the Courts subordinate to that Court. Subordinate Courts are held by Resident Magistrates, Administrative Officers, and Arab Kathis. In addition, District Courts, composed of benches of local headmen, exercise a limited criminal jurisdiction. An Appeal lies from the British Court and from the Zanzibar Court in the exercise of their original civil and criminal jurisdiction to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa and thence to the Privy Council.
