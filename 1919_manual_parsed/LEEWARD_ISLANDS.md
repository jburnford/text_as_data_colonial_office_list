# LEEWARD ISLANDS

THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Leeward Islands, so called in contrast to the Windward Islands, which are most exposed to the N.E. Trade, the prevailing wind in the West Indies, form the most northerly group of the Lesser Antilles, the whole of which were included among the Windward Islands as the term was used by the Spaniards. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin) and the United States (Biques and Culebra). The English Leeward Islands comprising the Presidencies of Antigua (with its dependencies, Barbuda and Redonda), Montserrat, St. Kitts, and Nevis (including Anguilla), Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the Colony is 704 square miles, about the size of the county of Surrey, and its population about 131,964.

The island of Sombrero was added to the colony by Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act, on August 10th, 1904.

History.

The islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica, they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 3 & 4 Will. IV., c.74. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Colonies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about
40 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December.

**Constitution.**

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 1 of 1899, the Legislative Council now consists of eight official and eight elective members. Three elective members are chosen by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, and three by those of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The official members are the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, the Administrators of St. Kitts-Nevis, and Dominica, and the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation, and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts for about one week.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the Legislative Body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act.

**Currency and Banking.**

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. The Colonial Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada have branches in Antigua, St. Kitts, and Dominica, and the latter bank has branches in Montserrat and Nevis. In the Virgin Islands there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (£3,500), and St. Kitts (£4,000), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender. Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

**Means of Communication.**

Mail communication exists with England and also with the other West Indian Islands (including Jamaica) and Demerara, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the southern islands, and to the United States of America, about once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line, and to Demerara, the other West Indian Islands (except Jamaica), Bermuda, and the Dominion of Canada by steamers of the Royal Mail Line every fortnight. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scrutton's Direct Line and others. The usual time occupied by the voyage from England to Antigua is about 16 days.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia (via Martinique) and Guadeloupe, and two cables connect St. Kitts with Antigua and St. Thomas. Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States, Bermuda, Canada and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable stations to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

**Postage.**

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union, but in the case of the U.K., India and British Colonies, letter postage is 1d. per oz. Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Dominica, the rates being 1d. for the first oz., and ½d. for every additional oz. within each of the islands.

**General Statistics of the Leeward Islands.**

Total population, census 1911, 127,189, being a decrease of 245 on that of 1901.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational in Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics. In St. Kitts-Nevis the State-aided denominational schools were closed at the end of the financial year 1914-15, and by amalgamating certain schools in proximity one to another the number of schools was reduced to 33, which are under the sole control of the Government and are entirely supported from public funds. On 31st March, 1918, there were 96 aided and Government schools in the Colony. The clergy of the various denominations are granted facilities for giving religious instruction during school hours to the children of their respective churches. During the financial year 1917-18 the Government grants to all the elementary schools in the Colony amounted to £8,921. 15s. 0d.

School fees have now been abolished in all public elementary schools throughout the colony for all scholars from the Sixth Standard downwards, children in the Seventh Standard alone paying fees. The schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. In the 98 aided and Government schools there were enrolled on 31st March, 1918, 23,396 children, with a daily average attendance of 10,548. Grants of varying amounts are also made to grammar or high schools established in each Presidency, except Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. Provision is also made for agricultural and technical instruction. The amount of Government Grant to secondary schools in the Colony exceeds £1,700. for over 260 scholars.

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 871) and Redonda (population 120) are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62½ square miles. Barbuda lies about 26 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 miles, is very flat, with a large lagoon on the west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was long owned by the Codrington family. It produces some salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing and horse rearing. Cotton is being grown with favourable results. It is one of the few islands where wild deer are still found. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 26 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 25° 6' N. lat., 61° 35' W. long., 1 mile by ¾ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered in 1885, now worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license and subject to an annual rental of 50l. On an average, 7,000 tons are annually exported to the United States, 90 men being employed.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1663 Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. The island is in the main low-lying and has no forests. Rainfall:

| 1917 | 39°15                            |

On the 22nd March, 1898, the Legislative Council, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated by the Governor, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new Council consists of sixteen members, eight official and eight non-official, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letter Patent. The Governor presides. By Ordinance No. 7, of 1910, the duration of the Council is limited to three years.

The chief productions are sugar, cotton and pineapples, but much of the land has been allowed to become ruined in the hands of the old planting families. There are 127 estates in cultivation, comprising approximately 52,000 acres. St. John, the chief town, has a population of 7,910, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1917, 30 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 537. The other towns are Falmouth, Parham and English Harbour.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

This Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population was 43,303 by the census of 1911, and the total area is about 150 square miles.

Constitution and Government.

In 1625 Sir Thomas Warner landed in St. Christopher, bearing a Royal Commission to the Earl of Carlisle, by which the islands of St. Christopher (or Merwar's Hope), Nevis, Barbados and Montserrat were taken under royal protection, and given over to his custody as the King's Lieutenant.

In 1672 St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla "and all other the Leeward Islands" were separated from Barbados and created the "Leeward Caribbee Islands Government," and Sir William Stapleton, Bart., was appointed "Captain-General" of the same. The chief seat of government was then at Nevis, but afterwards transferred to Antigua, and the government of each island, in the absence of the Captain-General, was administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, or, when none such was appointed, by the President of the Council.

In 1689 Colonel Christopher Codrington was appointed Governor-in-Chief, and his Commission, granted by William III., and dated 20th October, 1689, authorised him to call assemblies of freeholders and planters within any of the islands "jointly and severally to make laws for the public peace, welfare and good government of the said islands," thus providing for separate and federal legislatures. The Legislature in St. Christopher and in Nevis, as in the other islands of the government, consisted of two houses, a nominated Council and an elected Assembly, and had secured to it its own peculiar laws and local jurisdiction.

By Letters Patent, dated 26th April, 1816, the Commission originally granted to Sir William Stapleton was revoked, and the Leeward Caribbee Islands formed into two distinct governments, the first comprising Antigua, Montserrat and Barbuda, and the other St. Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd November, 1832, the General Government was restored, Dominica being for the first time included, and a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, with two Lieutenant-Governors for St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, and for Dominica respectively, were appointed, each island possessing a Legislative Council and House of Assembly, which continued, under the supervision of the Governor-in-Chief, to legislate for local interests.

In 1866 measures were introduced in each island to alter the constitution, and the two houses then existing were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, consisting of ex-officio members, nominees of the Crown, and representatives of the people elected under a limited franchise.

In 1877 the single chamber constitution was repealed in St. Kitts and in Nevis, and the Crown Colony form of government adopted in its stead, and in 1882 these two islands, with Anguilla, were united into one Presidency.

The office of Lieutenant-Governor, which existed until 1870, has been abolished, and the Presidency, in the absence therefrom of the Governor, is under the immediate supervision of an Administrator, acting under his instructions.

There is one Executive Council for the Presidency, consisting of the Governor, the Administrator, certain ex-officio members, and such other persons as His Majesty may from time to time appoint. The Legislative Council consists of six official and six nominated unofficial members, besides the Governor and the Administrator. Of the unofficial members not more than five shall be from among the people of St. Kitts and Anguilla, and one at least from among the people of Nevis. The Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator, or, in the absence of both of them, a member of the Council appointed in writing, presides, and the President of the Council enjoys an original and a casting vote. The Council meets at the town of Basseterre in St. Kitts.

Industry.

Tobacco was at first the principal crop grown, but it soon lost its pre-eminence, and the main industry of the two larger islands is now the production of sugar, molasses and rum, and the growth of Sea Island cotton. About 17,000 acres are in sugar-cane cultivation, and 3,000 in cotton. The crop exported from the Presidency during 1917 amounted to 15,048 tons of sugar, 4,933 puncheons of molasses, 2,950 gallons of rum, and 300,681 lbs. of Sea Island cotton. Arrowroot, coffee, peanuts and vegetables are also grown in small quantities for local consumption. Successful experiments have been carried on in the growing of coco-nuts, tobacco, cocoa and vanilla, and the prospects are encouraging. Cattle, horses and small mules are raised. Salt is produced in Anguilla, of which 4,350 barrels were exported in 1917.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land, within which are the salt ponds.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 3,711 feet above the sea. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the principal town, with a population of about 10,000. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, and about 750 feet in height.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island. The higher slopes of the mountains are covered with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The highest temperature in the shade is about 88°, the lowest 66°, and the mean average about 76°.

St. Christopher or St. Kitts, the Carib name of which was Liamuiga or Liamuiga, "The Fertile Isle," was the first settled of the British West Indies. Mr. Thomas Warner was despatched thither in 1623 by Mr. Ralph Merriefield, and commenced tobacco cultivation. His first crop, however, was destroyed by a hurricane, and the Colony was for some time in a precarious condition until the arrival of the ship Hopewell with supplies for the settlement.

In 1625, Warner, at the instance of the Earl of Carlisle, to whom Charles I. had granted Letters Patent over the islands of St. Christopher, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat and Barbados, was appointed Governor-General of these Islands and Governor of St. Kitts.

Upon the same day in the year that Warner returned from a recruiting visit to England M. D'Ennambuc, with a few Frenchmen, reached the island, and was permitted to form a settlement beside the English, a treaty of partition being afterwards made, the French obtaining the two ends of the island and the English the middle portion. From thence the greater number of the Lesser Antilles were colonised, thus earning for St. Kitts the name "Mother of the Antilles."

In October, 1628, a Spanish squadron devastated the island and ordered its abandonment, an order that had quite a contrary effect, and the two settlements rapidly increased. Warner was knighted in 1629.

War between the mother countries led to war between "the two nations" at St. Kitts, with the result that in April, 1666, the English were expelled from the island. Repelling an attempt at its recapture, the French remained in possession until the next year, when, by the Treaty of Breda, England recovered her share of it. Again, in 1689, the English suffered expulsion under cruel and barbarous circumstances, but a year later Sir Timothy Thornhill, after three weeks' fighting, recovered the island for the British arms, the whole of it remaining in England's possession for seven years, when, by the treaty of Rywick in 1697, the French were restored to their former portions of it.

Once again did England become sole mistress when, in 1702, the French capitulated without resistance to General Hamilton, supported by a fleet of twenty ships. A French invasion four years later proved futile, and in 1712 the whole island was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht.

For seventy years there was peace, and then, in 1782, after a memorable siege and two naval encounters, France enjoyed possession of the Fertile Isle. It was restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles on 28th January, 1783, and two French raids in 1805 and 1806 mark the close of the remarkable history of this island's warfares.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 40' N. lat., and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonised by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, has a population of about 1,500. The population of Nevis largely consists of peasant proprietors.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,596 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Kitts, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which, however, lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands. The distance between Basseterre (St. Kitts) and Charlestown (Nevis) is about twelve miles. The roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, but, as a rule, the boats which ply between the two ports have the wind abeam.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is situated in 18° 12' N. lat., and 63° 5' W. long., about 60 miles N.W. of St. Kitts, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at about 1,000/. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Civil Jurisdiction Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands, and is visited periodically by a Judge of the Summary Jurisdiction Court.

The island is healthy, but suffers from want of an adequate water supply. The population is 4,075. Besides cattle, ponies and small stock, the chief product is salt. The cultivation of Sea Island cotton has been extensively taken up, and is now, under the able administration of Mr. Rey, a resident planter, a settled industry.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 3048 square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque, rising at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin to 4,747 feet. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of

312,092l. 1s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed a unit of a General Government, which comprised Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1776, a Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval expedition against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of it on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was appointed Governor. Trade failed, and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican leader, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1806, now referred to in the island for marking the time of events, by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts, near the town of Portsmouth.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H. L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of 15,000l. by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the Island. The Imperial Road has been constructed out of this grant as a bridle road for a distance of 15 miles from the coast at Canefield to Bassinville in the interior, and a length of 5 miles of a surveyed line of road, 14 miles long, intended to connect Bassinville with Layou on the western coast, has also been constructed from the Layou end.

This road has been greatly improved recently, and it is possible to motor for a distance of 10 miles. A bridle track has been made through the bush from Stone Hill and Bassinville to Concord on the Windward coast at Peguoa Bay; thus a new means of communication has now been established between the Leeward and Windward coasts by land.

It is estimated that about 130,000 acres in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is rich and the climate healthy, and the island is well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, especially Arabian, and, on the higher slopes in the centre of the island, cocoa, tea, limes, nutmegs, spices, and tropical fruits of all kinds.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, volcanic ash covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers, with fish in some, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Cocoa, lime-juice, citrate of lime, coconuts, and fruit (including green limes) are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, has now ceased to be made. A considerable trade is carried on also in spices, oils, and timber. The principal exports in 1915 were: Cocoa, 39,301l.; limes and lime juice, 157,295l.; citrate of lime, 3,749l.; coconuts, 1,582l.; essential oils, 12,928l.; fruit and vegetables, 946l.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1917 was 80-80 inches; the average for the whole island was 110-53 inches; the mean temperature 79° Fahr.

The chief town is Roseau, population of 6,577 according to the census of April, 1911, it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1915, 13 vessels, of a total tonnage of 114 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north-west of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of the Colonial Bank at Roseau, and one of the Royal Bank of Canada, established in April, 1915.

There is a Government telephone system of 432 miles, with 7 exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 5 members. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abrogating itself, and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new council consists of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Administrator presides in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency.

A considerable number of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is becoming general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the Island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1298, 1902).

According to the Census of 1911 there are about 420 Caribs in the Island, of whom about 170 are estimated as of pure blood.

MONTSERRAT.

This Island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 32½ square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Soufrière Hill (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of 1,534, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1917, 4 sailing vessels, total tonnage 110 tons net.

Montserrat was colonised by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. After undergoing various modifications they became merged in a Legislative Assembly, which lasted down to 1867.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly, a Legislative Council was established, having all the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. By Act No. 2, of 1902, which rescinded these Acts, His Majesty may, from time to time, appoint such persons, not exceeding four in all, as he may think fit, every Councillor holding office during His Majesty's pleasure. Ordinance No. 4 of 1909 repeals No. 2 of 1902 and limits the duration of the Council to three years. Ordinance No. 2 of 1911 amends No. 4 of 1909 and increases the number of members to six.

The cultivation of sugar, once the staple industry of the island, has almost disappeared, and lime-juice and cotton are now the principal products, the exports of lime products in 1917 amounting to 136,706 gallons of raw, 17,969l.; 969 gallons of concentrated juice, 188l.; and 27 tons of citrate of lime, 3,240l.; of a total value...
of 21,397l. There are about 1,200 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation is being yearly extended. The industry is principally in the hands of the Montserrat Company, Limited. A trade in fresh limes, which are shipped to London, has also sprung up, valued at 57l. were exported in 1917.

The cultivation of Sea Island cotton (which was once grown during the American Civil War), was re-introduced in 1901; and, where the lands are suitable, has superseded the sugar industry; the output in 1917 amounted to 409,511 lbs. of lint, valued at 61,427l., while the sugar shipped amounted to 294 tons only, of the value of 4,276l. The industry is being further expanded, all suitable lands being cultivated.

Owing to the war in Europe, and the consequent increased demand for cane sugar, the cultivation was considerably enlarged in 1916.

A certain amount of fresh pineapples are exported annually to the English and Canadian markets. Among the other exports may be mentioned a drug known as "papain," exported to the value of 1,169l. (1,877 lbs.) in 1917, essential oils, 179 gallons, valued at 313l., and corn (386 bushels), valued at 60l.

The cultivation of coffee and cocoa, which had declined to such an extent that enough for home consumption was not grown, is being revived, and 37 cwt. of cocoa, of the value of 109l., was exported in 1917.

There are eight Anglican schools with 1,603 scholars, three Wesleyan with 860, one Roman Catholic with 246, and one undenominational with 263 scholars.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, macadamised, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects, as far as the small revenue of the island will permit.

On 7th August, 1899, the island was devastated by a fearful hurricane.

The island is considered to be the most healthy of the Antilles. Death-rate 1917, 16-21 per 1,000.

The rainfall in 1917, was 58-43 inches (mean of 21 stations); and the mean temperature is about dry bulb 81°4', wet bulb 74°6'.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to eastward of and adjacent to Porto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dyke, Peter Island, Salt Island, and all others not in the possession of the United States of America. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. A lighthouse is maintained by the Board of Trade on Sombrero, which was first included in the Colony in 1904.

The Americans possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the Constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted, to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members, to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government. This Ordinance was repealed May 1st, 1902, under which the Governor of the Leeward Islands ordains the laws. There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Road Town, Tortola, population (1911) 410, which is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1917, 4 vessels, total tonnage, 82.

A small quantity of sugar is made in the Virgin Islands, and during the American Civil War the landed proprietors planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly. The cultivation of Sea Island cotton was commenced in 1904, and a cotton ginnery has been erected by the Imperial Agricultural Department. The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise a few cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands, makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy, intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their trade and intercourse is with the Virgin Islands of the U.S., and to a smaller extent with Hayti and San Domingo.

During the years 1914 and 1915, the planting of coconuts by the Government Experiment Station and by proprietors of land in the Virgin
Islands received much attention, and approximately 60 acres have been established. A large area of land in the Virgin Islands is well adapted to coconut cultivation, and the existing trees are quite free from any serious insect or fungoid pests.

The currency consists almost entirely of foreign money, which circulates at the following rates of exchange: Danish money at 25 francs to £1., American money at $5 to £1.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great. The average annual rainfall at Road Town is about 54 inches.

Large quantities of fibrous plants (agaves and bromelias) grow wild everywhere in Tortola.

The mail communication is by small sailing craft to St. Thomas. Mails are despatched to St. Thomas nearly every day, letters for Europe being usually sent via Havre about eight times a month.
