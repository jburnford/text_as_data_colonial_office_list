# TRINIDAD

**TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.**

**TRINIDAD.**

**Situation and Area.**

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 69 miles, and its average breadth 54 miles, and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony includes the island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 26th of Oct., 1888, it was provided that, on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, the island of Tobago should be a ward of the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony, and that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled. A proclamation was issued bringing these provisions into force from the 1st January, 1899.

**History.**

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalised his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th
February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The estimated population of Trinidad and Tobago at 31st December, 1917, was 377,021. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 124,977. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of six members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted in 1898, and now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, the Inspector-General of Constabulary, the Director of Public Works, the Surgeon-General, the Protector of Immigrants, the Receiver-General, and the Collector of Customs, and of such other persons (unofficial members) as the Governor may appoint. The unofficial members hold their seats for five years, and are at present eleven in number.

**General Description.**

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Government acquired in May, 1910, the floating graving dock and workshops formerly worked by the Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company under agreement with the Government, and the concern is now being carried on by the Government as a business administration. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 65 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the administration. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1917 were: Sugar, 1,253,080 cwts., cacao, 626,851 cwts., coconuts, 16,595,282 nuts, copra, 7,201,448 lbs., molasses, 1,398,324 galls., rum, 87,192 galls., petroleum (crude), 35,890,511 galls., petroleum spirit (gasoline) 1,248,097 galls., bitters, timber, manjack, and asphalt are also exported.

The minerals at present worked are chiefly asphalt, petroleum, and manjak.

**Asphalt.**—An asphalt lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the Ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain. It is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of 10,000£, and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease was for 21 years from 1st January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from 1st February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of 4,000£ a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from asphalt (the greater part of which came from the Lake) in 1917 was 44,526£.

**Petroleum.**—The number of wells drilled during 1917 was 44, thus bringing the total number of wells drilled in the Colony to 31st December, 1917, to 369, of which 199 are on Crown Lands. The quantity of oil extracted during 1917, amounted to 56,080,914 imperial gallons, which compares favourably with the quantity obtained (32,475,696) during 1916. At the end of December, 1917, there were eleven Oil Companies engaged in the winning of oil, the principal being the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Petroleum Development Company, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease; the United British Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, partly from their own and partly from Crown Lands; the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease; the Trinidad Oil and Transport Company, Limited, from private lands at Barrackpore; and the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaquite. There are still large areas of Crown Lands under exploration licences to the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited; which now includes the Ortoire Syndicate, Limited. When the geological surveys have been completed certain portions of these areas will be taken up, either under prospecting licence or lease, and the remainder will revert to the Crown. Throughout the oil areas, great activity has, and is, being displayed by the agents of the Oil Companies, in securing by purchase the oil rights of private landowners. Two large refineries are engaged in the manufacture of oil fuel. There are several smaller refineries engaged in the manufacture of petrol, kerosene, and oil fuel. The petrol is used for local consumption and is also exported to the neighbouring colonies and South America; the kerosene is used locally, and the oil fuel both locally and for bunkering purposes. Considerable quantities of crude oil are at times exported to England and the United States of America. The Admiralty have also taken several cargoes of crude oil and fuel oil during the past year.

Satisfactory progress was being made in the direction of the establishment of a fruit trade, and in 1906-6, 4,259£ worth of fruit was exported to the United Kingdom as a commencement of the industry, and in 1910, it had increased to 19,952£. There was a decrease in 1916 to 1,390£, and in 1917 to 464£ due to a lack of shipping facilities consequent on the war. The prospects of the banana and rubber cultivations, which have been taken up in recent years, are very encouraging.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about 100,000£ sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. About one-fourth, one-eighth, and one-third of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States of America respectively.
The countries of origin of the imports of the last five years were:

| Year | United Kingdom | Canada | Other British Possessions | United States | Venezuela | France | Germany | Other Countries |
|------|----------------|--------|---------------------------|---------------|-----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| 1913 | 892,593        | 256,435| 178,921                   | 813,718       | 468,658   | 61,183 | 40,179  | 116,963        |
| 1914 | 906,837        | 325,374| 201,171                   | 852,988       | 290,401   | 60,027 | 35,940  | 133,794        |
| 1915 | 959,051        | 419,014| 235,321                   | 906,904       | 404,900   | 46,863 | 59,034  | 90,926         |
| 1916 | 964,086        | 513,313| 287,108                   | 1,273,002     | 457,053   | 59,034 | 44,286  | 84,363         |
| 1917 | 850,504        | 747,816| 424,547                   | 1,579,562     | 446,286   | 41,502 | ...     | 40,407         |

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The mean temperature for the year was 76° and the rainfall 69°.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1911, 59,796), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1915, 24 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 4,000 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

By Ordinance No. 24 of 1914, Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city, and its powers and duties were further extended by Ordinances Nos. 25 and 28 of 1914, and No. 36 of 1915. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1911 (census), 8,667), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1911 (census), 4,020). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1917, was £123,431, the expenditure, £109,121, and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was £36,160, on the 31st December, 1917. This includes the loan of £5,000 for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,263,697 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1917, was estimated to be approximately 650,586 acres. About 480,936 acres are under cultivation; 613,111 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

Under a contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company a weekly trip around the island and including the island ward of Tobago, calling at all the principal ports, is maintained.

The Government own two small steamers which maintain communication to the island resorts between Port of Spain and the Bocas, including the prison establishments and the lighthouse.

The railway was commenced by a line between Port of Spain and Arima, 16 miles, opened in 1876, and by subsequent extensions the railway system now consists of the Port of Spain—Arima—Sangre Grande line (opened in 1897) 29 miles along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast. The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1880, San Fernando in 1882, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.

The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabaguine in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction, 144 miles from Port of Spain in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.

The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line north of San Fernando (33 miles) in an easterly direction in Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles, and

The Cipero tramway, to the south of San Fernando, also proceeding by another route to Princes Town, which, with branches (13½ miles), was merged into the railway system in 1912.

The total length of this system is now 123 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 6 to 8 trains daily each way.

In connection with the railway at San Fernando, two small fast steamers make five trips a week to La Brea, near the celebrated pitch lake, the oil-fields, Cedros, and to the south-western part of the island at Icaos, stopping at five intermediate stopping places, carrying passengers, the mails and goods.

The railway stations are in telegraphic communication one with the other on all parts of the system open to the public, and there is a telephone line south-west of San Fernando along the steamer route, giving a total length of about 114 miles of telegraph and about 60 miles of telephone lines, in addition to about 15 miles of telephone line for railway use alone.

The total receipts from the railways, railway-steamers, telegraphs and telephones for the year 1917 amounted to £157,514, and the working expenses to £140,326, exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to £48,352. The high cost of fuel is responsible for the increased expenditure, but the engines are being adapted to burn oil fuel and a considerable saving will in future be made.

The total number of passengers carried during 1917 was 1,701,665. The total tonnage of goods (including canes, 74,577 tons) was 351,947 tons.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and about 98 out-offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada and Saint Croix, and thence via Canada or the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 904 miles, constructed by the Government.

The wireless telegraph system, established in 1906 to bring Tobago into telegraphic communication with Trinidad, gave satisfactory results during the year 1917. The number of steamships calling at this and other West Indian ports equipped with wireless apparatus has considerably increased, and wireless communication with ships...
has consequently been considerably extended.

The following number of messages passed:

Wireless communication with British Guiana has been satisfactorily established, and during cable interruptions all traffic between Trinidad and British Guiana is dealt with by the Port of Spain wireless station.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 45 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides a number of steamers calling for bunker coal and orders:— Royal Mail Steam Packet Co., London Direct Line, Glasgow Direct Line, Leyland Line, Harrison Line, Compagnie General Transatlantique Royal Dutch Mail, La Veloce (Navigazione Italiana), East Asiatic Co. (Danish), James Nourse, Ltd., Trinidad Line (Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co., Ltd.), Lamport and Holt, Prince Line, Ltd., and Navigacion Fluvial y Costanera De Venezuela. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

The ocean steamers of the Royal Mail S.P. Co. make Port of Spain their headquarters and connect here with the Company’s inter-colonial steamers.

The largest steamers calling regularly are those of the Lamport and Holt Line, Cie. General Transatlantique and the Royal Mail S.P. Co. These steamers find no difficulty in coming well within the limits of the harbour. The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:—

- Within Colony* ... 1d.
- To U.K., India and British Colonies 1d.
- To other places ... 2½d.

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. The number of immigrants introduced each season since 1897 is as follows:—

| Year | Number |
|------|--------|
| 1897 | 1,859  |
| 1898 | 1,292  |
| 1899-0 | 1,817 |
| 1900-1 | nil   |
| 1901-2 | 2,553 |
| 1902-3 | 2,348 |
| 1903-4 | 2,458 |
| 1904-5 | 1,265 |
| 1905-6 | 3,796 |
| 1906-7 | 2,502 |

580 Statute adults were returned to India in 1915-16, 686 in 1916, and none in 1917, no ships being available.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, and United States gold currency. These are all legal tender, but British gold is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of 208,333/-, 6s. 8d. estimated. The Royal Bank of Canada also issues its own notes and has an authorised note circulation in the Colony of 312,500/.

There is no Colonial coinage, but an Ordinance (No. 16.-1903), for the issue of Government 1 and 2 dollar currency Notes was passed on the 23rd December, 1903; on June 12th, 1914, the first issue of $1,000 notes was made. The total value of such notes in circulation at the end of December, 1917, was 176,258/-, of which 71,041/- consists of $1,000 notes.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada have now branches in Port of Spain and San Fernando. Government savings banks are established in fifteen districts, with a head office in Port of Spain. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1917 was 368,874/-, 12s. 11d. The total number of depositors was 26,712. They are under the management of a board, a chief manager of savings banks, and the local wardens.

Openings for the Investment of Capital.—Of the industries which offer inducements to investors of capital, in Trinidad and Tobago, the cultivation of cocoa is perhaps the most attractive, and profitable investments are to be secured either in

(a) the formation of an estate,
(b) the purchase of an established estate, or
(c) the investment of capital on the security of an established estate.

Sound investments for capital can usually be obtained for sums under $1,000 (208/-, 6s. 8d.) at 10%; from $1,000 up to $6,000 (1,250l.) at 8%; and over $6,000 at 6 or 7%.

The price of sugar, owing to the war, has risen considerably, and manufacturing profits have been very large during the last two years. In addition to the canes grown by the factory-owners on their estates, a large proportion is grown by farmers and sold to the factories at prices which at present leave a large margin of profit. The cultivation of farmers’ canes is increasing so considerably that it is doubtful whether the present factories are of sufficient capacity to handle any further increase, and the erection of another central factory on a suitable site would probably be a sound investment, and if worked on a co-operative basis would be of great benefit to the sugar industry of the Colony.

The oil industry is progressing so favourably that carefully chosen investments are worthy of attention.

Coconut cultivation is rapidly extending, and many enquiries have been made for the investment of capital in this industry. Owners are holding on to their estates and the profitable returns derived therefrom. There are lands available for forming new estates.

The lime industry affords opportunities for profitable investments with quick returns.

Fibre cultivation for the manufacture of pulp for paper is likely to be a prominent feature among the coming agricultural industries of the Colony.

---

* For the duration of the War a War Tax of an additional 1½d. per letter is enforced, not only within the Colony, but to the United Kingdom, British Colonies, India, and the United States of America.
Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), the Roman Catholic Institutions, St. Mary's College and the Convent School in Port of Spain, and Naparima College (Presbyterian)—the two latter being affiliated to the Royal College. Attached to these institutions are three scholarships of £60 each, which are granted annually at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of December, 1917—136 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 329 on those of St. Mary's College, 80 in the Naparima College, and 310 St. Joseph Convent School.

The elementary schools are now 290 in number, 52 of which are secular schools, supported entirely by the Government, and 238 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the practising schools and two assisted schools 5s. per month is charged. There are two Government and three denominational colleges for teachers, in which 37 students are trained. The Government schools in 1917 had 8,395 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 38,771.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 49,470, with an average daily attendance of about 30,122. The teaching of practical agriculture now proves part of the daily routine in the majority of boys' and mixed schools in the Colony. 227 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1917.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1673, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

By Order in Council under Act 50 & 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1899. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, Tobago became a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from the 1st January, 1899.

Situation and Area.

It lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,313 acres, of which about 25,460 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The estimated population of Tobago in 1916 was 22,613.

General Description.

Cocoa, coconuts, copra and live stock form the principal articles of export, and the cultivation of the first two is still being extended. But little sugar is now produced. Vegetables, poultry, eggs and fruit are produced in considerable quantities, and find ready sale in the Trinidad markets to which in 1917 over 20,994l. worth were exported. Exports from Tobago for the year ending 31st December, 1917, were valued at 68,296l.

Principal items—

| Item       | Value   |
|------------|---------|
| Cocoa      | £32,847 |

showing a decrease of £22,422 on the figures for 1916. This decrease is due to the fall in the value of cocoa, and to more local foodstuffs having been retained for home consumption owing to the restrictions of importations.
The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1911, of 729. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of subsidized coastal steamers, provided under contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.

The island possesses a large mileage of good roads and these are rapidly being extended and improved.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

**Constitution.**

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was *ex officio* a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created. Various other changes have been made in the direction of reducing the establishments.
