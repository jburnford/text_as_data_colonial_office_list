ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. Besides the peninsula a strip of territory stretching about three miles inland belongs to England, the whole area being about eighty square miles. Dhala and El Hota are the principal villages outside the town of Aden. The rainfall rarely exceeds 7 inches in a year. The town of Aden is situated on the side of a rocky promontory, and is very strongly fortified. It is a most important coaling station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc. The settlement is subject to the Government of Bombay, being presided over by a Resident, who is also commander of the troops in the garrison. (For further information, see publications relating to India.)

PEHRIM, an island about five square miles in area, situated at the entrance of the Red Sea, is a dependency of Aden, and is administered from that port. It is also an important coaling depot for the merchant marine, and contains a lighthouse.

The Arab chiefships between Aden and Muscat territory are also in subordinate treaty relations with the Government of India, these relations being within the charge of the Aden Residency.

SOCOTRA, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 19° 19'—12° 42' N. lat., and 53° 21'—53° 30' E. long. and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the Government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belonged. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island is about 12,000, of Arab descent. It is 72 miles by 22 miles, with peaks 200 feet high. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October, 1886, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kute and Bromers Islands.
