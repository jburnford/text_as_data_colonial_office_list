AUSTRALIA.

THE COMMONWEALTH.

The Commonwealth of Australia is constituted under an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1900—63 & 64 Vict., cap. 12. By this Act it was made lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the Privy Council, to proclaim that, on and after a day appointed in the proclamation, the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, and also if Her Majesty were satisfied that the people of Western Australia had agreed thereto, of Western Australia, should be united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia.

A proclamation was accordingly issued by Her Majesty on the 17th of September, 1900, appointing the 1st of January, 1901, as the day on which the Commonwealth should be established—Western Australia being included in accordance with the result of a referendum taken before that date in the Colony and with Addresses passed by both Houses of the Legislature.

A short history of the events leading up to the establishment of the Commonwealth, and of the provisions of the Constitution, as fixed by the Act of Parliament above quoted, is given below. The account of the different States of the Commonwealth is arranged alphabetically, and a description of territories dependent on the Commonwealth follows.

The Earl of Hopetoun (afterwards Marquis of Linlithgow) was selected as the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth, and a Commission was issued to him on the 29th of October, 1900.

It was announced in September that the Queen would issue a special Commission to H.R.H. the Duke of York, for opening in Her Majesty's name the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament in the spring of 1901, and that H.R.H., accompanied by the Duchess of York, would pay visits to the different States of the Commonwealth. At the invitation of the Government of New South Wales, a representative body of troops, about 1,000 strong, sailed from England in November, to attend the inauguration of the Commonwealth at Sydney on the 1st of January, 1901. A small detachment of officers and non-commissioned officers of the Indian Army also proceeded to Sydney on the same occasion. The Commission issued by the Queen to the Duke of York was renewed on the accession of King Edward VII. The Duke and Duchess landed at Melbourne on the 6th of May, and on the 9th the Duke opened the first session in the Exhibition Building at Melbourne. The Duke and Duchess subsequently visited Brisbane, Sydney, New Zealand, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth, leaving Australia on the 26th of July to continue their tour to Mauritius, South Africa and North America.

Australian Federation.

Until the passing of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act the only means of joint legislative action in Australia was provided by the "Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act created a Council of two members from each Colony which adopted the Act, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which had only one member each, with power to Her Majesty at the request of the Legislatures of the Colonies to increase the number of representatives for each Colony by Order in Council. Such an increase was upon the request of the Legislatures made by Her Majesty on 3rd March, 1894, when an Order in Council was passed, providing that each Colony which was or should be represented on the Federal Council, except any Crown Colony, be represented by five members. This Council had power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits, service and enforcement respectively of civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they had been passed, the extradition of offenders, and the custody of offenders on ships belonging to Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two or more Colonies might also refer to it for legislation questions of defence, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, status of corporations, and joint stock companies, and other matters of general Australasian interest; but legislation of the Council on such matters was to extend only to the Colonies by whose Legislatures the matters should have been so referred, and such Colonies as might afterwards adopt the same. It had also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent. The Council was to meet at least once in every two years.

The first meeting took place on 25th January, 1886, when representatives were present from Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed authorising the service of the civil powers and the enforcement of the judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented, and various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits. The second session opened on 16th January, 1888. An address was adopted to Her Majesty respecting the deportation of French criminals to the Pacific. An Act was also passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Beche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Queensland. The Council met for its third session on 29th January, 1889, when representatives from South Australia were present for the first time. An Act was passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Beche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Western Australia.
The amendment of the basis of representation in the Council was discussed at the session, and communications on the subject subsequently passed with the Imperial Government. The fourth session opened 20th January, and closed 24th January, 1891. South Australia was not represented, the Act (a temporary measure for two years only) under which that province joined the Council having expired. The only Bill passed was one to facilitate the recognition in other Colonies of Orders and Declarations of the Supreme Court of any Colony in matters of lunacy. An address to Her Majesty was also adopted referring to the desirability of British subjects being placed on an equal footing with subjects of other countries in regard to the acquisition of land in, and trading with, natives of the New Hebrides.

The fifth session was commenced on 26th January, 1893, when the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia were represented. An Act was passed providing for the discipline and government of the garrisons established at King George's Sound and Thursday Island; and a resolution was adopted in favour of an increase in the number of representatives for each Colony, except any Crown Colony, to five. The Standing Committee was instructed to take steps for giving effect to this resolution, and also for securing the adhesion of the Colonies not represented in the Council. As the result of action taken by the Standing Committee, the Legislatures of all the Colonies in the Council addressed Her Majesty, requesting that the proposed increase in the number of representatives might be made; and, on 3rd March, 1894, Her Majesty was pleased to make an Order in Council providing "that each Colony which is or shall be represented in the said Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members."

The sixth session opened on the 30th January, 1895, when the same four Colonies were represented as at the preceding session. There were present, for the first time, five delegates from each Colony. At this session no Bills were brought forward, but resolutions were adopted affirming the desirability of defining the status, and of granting facilities for the winding up of companies carrying on business in different Colonies; of rendering uniform the laws relating to banking; of establishing an effectual system of quarantine; of adopting a more economic method of raising public loans; and of taking steps with a view to the holding of a second Federation Convention. An address to the Queen was also adopted praying for the appointment of an Australasian representative on the Privy Council Bench, in view of the special features often presented by Australasian appeals.

The seventh session was commenced on 26th January, 1897, when the Colonies of Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia, were represented. An Act was passed, upon a reference of the matter to the Council by the Legislatures of Victoria and Queensland, to provide for the naturalisation within the Australian Colonies, or some of them, of persons of European descent naturalised in any of such Colonies, also upon a reference of the subject by the Legislatures of Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, an Act was passed to make provision for the enforcement in certain cases within the Australasian Colonies, or some of them, of Orders of the Supreme Court of such Colonies for the production of testamentary instruments. The Council adopted an Address to Her Majesty, referring to the Address adopted in 1891 with regard to restrictions in the way of trade with the natives of the New Hebrides, urging that negotiations may be entered into with the other Powers concerned with a view to imposing on their subjects equal restrictions in that trade. This and all the previous sessions were held at Hobart. The Council resolved that the place of its next meeting should be Melbourne.

The Commonwealth Act.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Federal Council, however, a movement was made for the establishment of a more effective Federation, to embrace a Federal Executive, as well as Legislature, somewhat upon the model of Canada. Towards the end of 1889 negotiations were opened between the various Australasian Colonies, the result being that a Conference of the seven principal Australasian Colonies met in Melbourne, on the 6th February, 1890. At this Conference it was unanimously agreed that the best interests of the Australian Colonies would be promoted by their "early union under the Crown," and that the Legislatures of the various Colonies should be invited to appoint to a National Australasian Convention during the year 1890 delegates empowered to report upon the scheme for a Federal Constitution.

In accordance with these resolutions, delegates were appointed, and the Convention commenced its deliberations in Sydney on the 2nd March, 1891. After an animated discussion, which lasted more than five weeks, a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia" was drawn up and adopted. This Bill the Convention recommended should be submitted by the Parliaments for the approval of the people of the several Colonies. It provided for the union of the Australasian Colonies in a Federal Commonwealth under the Crown, for a Governor-General to be appointed by the Crown, who should be aided and advised by an Executive Council, the constitution of a Senate and House of Representatives, with certain definite powers, the latter to have the initiation of money bills, which the former might pass or reject, but not amend, and for the establishment of a Federal Judicature; the revenue of the Commonwealth to be derived from the Customs and Excise duties, and other taxation, which should be collected by Federal officers, and expended as required for Federal purposes, any surplus to be returned to the respective Colonies. It also provided for absolute Free Trade internally throughout the Commonwealth, so soon as the Parliament should have imposed uniform Customs duties. The draft Bill of 1891, though it crystallised the idea of Federation, failed to command the serious attention of the Legislatures, and Federalists began a popular agitation to place the movement on a new footing.

A meeting of the Premiers of all the Australasian Colonies took place in Hobart in January, 1895, and agreed to a scheme for framing a Federal Constitution to be submitted for the approval of their respective Parliaments. The enabling Bill, adopted at this Conference providing for the election by each Colony of 10 delegates to prepare a scheme of Federation, was adopted by the Parliaments of N. S. Wales, Victoria, S. Australia, and Tasmania, and in a modified form by Western Australia.

Delegates were accordingly duly elected and assembled in Convention at Adelaide on 22nd March, 1897, for the purpose of drafting a constitution. Having prepared a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia," the Convention was on the 23rd April adjourned to reassemble at
Sydney on 2nd September. The draft Bill was in the meantime submitted to the local Legislatures, and various amendments were suggested by those bodies. The Bill, together with those amendments, was further considered by the Delegates at the Sydney Session of the Convention, and a long discussion took place on various proposals submitted for settling questions of difference between the two Houses of the new Federal Legislature. Considerable progress was made with the rest of the measure, but the work of revision was not completed, and the Convention adjourned until 20th January, 1898, partly in the hope of seeing Delegates from Queensland join in the final discussion. This hope was not realised, as the Queensland Legislature, for the second time, shelved the Enabling Bill.

The Convention met again at Melbourne on the 20th of January, 1898, and remained in session till the 17th of March, and a Bill was adopted which in accordance with the Federation Enabling Acts of the different Colonies was submitted to the popular vote for acceptance or rejection. In Victoria the polling was—For acceptance, 100,520; against, 22,099. The Bill was also accepted by the vote of the people in South Australia and Tasmania. But in New South Wales the statutory minimum number of 80,000 affirmative votes required by the Enabling Act of that Colony was not obtained, and the matter fell through for the time.

A further Conference of Premiers was held at Melbourne in January, 1899, to consider the objections of New South Wales; and this time Queensland was represented. The Premiers met in a spirit of compromise, and on the 2nd of February an agreement was come to which all the Premiers agreed to submit to their Parliaments for reference to the electors, it being understood that New South Wales should lead the way. South Australia, however, for purposes of local convenience, took a referendum vote upon the Bill on the occasion of the General Election, without waiting for New South Wales. This vote was taken on the 29th of April, when 65,990 votes were given for Federation and 17,063 against.

In New South Wales the Bill providing for the reference to the people of the amended draft constitution was passed by the Lower House on the 2nd of March, but in the Upper House amendments were made. One of these required that one-third of the electors on the register should vote for the Bill in order to secure its acceptance. The Bill as amended passed the Legislative Council on the 21st of March. On March the 22nd the Lower House rejected the amendments of the Upper House. The latter body refused to give way. A conference between the two Houses was held without result on the 28th of March. Mr. Reid, Premier of New South Wales, prorogued Parliament for a few days, and on his advice the Governor added twelve new members to the Council. The Bill was re-introduced in the Lower House, and passed on the 13th of April. It was accepted by the Legislative Council with an unimportant amendment (providing that a period of eight weeks should elapse before the referendum was taken) on the 20th of April, and on the 25th of April it was announced that the question would be submitted to the electors on the 20th of June. It was accepted by a majority of about 25,000.

On the 27th July, the amended Commonwealth Bill was accepted by overwhelming majorities in Victoria and Tasmania, and on the 2nd September by a majority of about 7,500 in Queensland. The delay in taking action in Western Australia led to some correspondence between Sir John Forrest, Premier of Western Australia, and Mr. Reid. Mr. Reid declared on behalf of the Federating Colonies that no amendments to meet the views entertained in Western Australia could now be considered; and the same assurance was repeated by Sir G. Turner, Premier of Victoria. Sir J. Forrest, in fulfilment of his undertaking at the Premiers' conference, brought the draft Constitution before the Legislature, which referred it to a Select Committee, who reported that it should not be accepted without considerable amendment. The Legislative Council finally refused to allow a referendum to be taken.

Addressed to the Queen from the five Colonies which had accepted the Constitution praying for the enactment of the Commonwealth Bill were received in the autumn of 1899.

As it appeared that some alterations in the Bill might be required by the Imperial Government, Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Governor of New South Wales, expressing the hope that Delegates were coming home to advise and assist during the passage of the Bill through Parliament.

Delegates were appointed, and reached England in March. Western Australia also sent a Delegate to represent the views of that Colony, and the Agent-General for New Zealand was appointed to watch the interests of New Zealand.

The discussion between Her Majesty's Government and the Delegates turned chiefly on the clauses of the Bill relating to the Appeals to the Privy Council. Under the Bill, in Section 74, appeals were allowed both from the Supreme Courts of the States and from the Federal High Court, but there was a limitation in cases affecting the interpretation of the Constitution of the Commonwealth or of a State "unless the public interests of some part of Her Majesty's dominions other than the Commonwealth or a State are involved." Various memoranda passed on this subject of Clause 74, the Delegates demurring to any alteration in the Bill, whilst Her Majesty's Government pointed out the difficulty of interpreting the Clause, and the danger that it might unduly restrict the right of appeal in cases where the interests of foreigners or British subjects outside Australia were affected.

The Bill was introduced into Parliament with amendments to secure Her Majesty's prerogative to grant special leave of appeal from the High Court of the Commonwealth or the Supreme Court of any State to the Privy Council. But the discussion with the Delegates continued, and two successive compromises were arrived at. First, the appeal on Constitutional questions was made dependent on the consent of the Executive Government or Governments concerned, and finally was made dependent on a certificate to be granted at the discretion of the High Court.

No other amendments of any consequence were made by Parliament in the Bill as received from Australia, except that provision was made for the inclusion of Western Australia as an original State, provided that Her Majesty was satisfied that the people of that Colony had agreed thereto prior to the issue of the Proclamation.

The Queen caused to be sent to Australia, for presentation to the Commonwealth Parliament, a duplicate of the Commission issued for the formal declaration of Her assent to the Act, together with the pen, inkstand, and table used on the occasion of its signature. She subsequently presented a duplicate of the Proclamation bringing the Act into force, duly signed and passed under the Great Seal.
Constitution of the Commonwealth.

The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia is contained in the Act of Parliament 63 & 64 Vict., cap. 12. The opening part of the Act recites that the union is to be indissoluble and provides for the admission of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the Queen. It makes provision for the proclamation and date of establishment of the Commonwealth, declares the binding force of Commonwealth laws, and makes definitions. The Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885, is repealed, and the Commonwealth is declared to be a single self-governing Colony for the purposes of the Colonial Boundaries Act.

The leading features of the Constitution proper are as follows:

- The Parliament consists of the King, a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Governor-General acts for the King.
- The Senate consists of six members from each State. The number may be increased or diminished, but so that the equal representation of the original States is maintained, and no original State has less than six Senators. Qualifications for Senators are the same as those for Members of the House of Representatives, as given below. Senators are chosen for six years. The qualifications of electors for the first Parliament were those for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State in which the elector was competent to vote. In the first Parliament of the Commonwealth the Franchise Act, 1902, unified the franchise for both Houses, on the basis of universal adult suffrage.
- The House of Representatives has approximately twice as many members as the Senate, and the number of members for each State is in proportion to the population, but not less than five for any State. The qualifications of electors are as stated in the preceding paragraph. Each elector is to vote only once. Qualification of a Member to be (a) 21 years of age; (b) to be an elector or entitled to be; (c) resident 3 years; (d) natural born or naturalised 5 years.
- House may continue to exist for 3 years from first meeting, but may be dissolved sooner; number of members may be increased or diminished by Parliament, subject to the Constitution.
- The general powers of the Parliament are grouped under 39 headings, the principal of which are to make laws for trade, taxation, bounties, borrowing, postal services, naval and military, census and statistics, currency, banking, insolvency, corporations, divorce, marriage, old age pensions, immigration and emigration, railways, &c. Exclusive powers in regard to the seat of Government, State departments transferred, and other matters declared by the Constitution to be within the exclusive power of the Parliament.
- Money Bills not to originate in, nor to be amended by, the Senate, which House may, however, return the Bill requesting any omission or amendment. Equal power in all other matters. Tacking Bills prohibited.
- Provision for Dead-locks.—Joint dissolution, and if again passed in Lower House and rejected in Senate a joint sitting to be held, and if passed by an absolute majority of total number of both Houses, disputed Bill to become law.
- A Bill having passed both Houses the Governor-General shall either assent, withhold assent, reserve the Bill or return it, and recommend amendments.
- Executive power vested in King and exercisable by Governor-General in Council, who may appoint Ministers of State.
- State departments of Customs and Excise transferred to Commonwealth on its establishment. Departments of posts, naval and military, defence, light-houses, &c., and quarantine, on a date or dates to be proclaimed.
- High Court of Australia established; appellate and original jurisdiction.
- Collection of Customs to pass to Commonwealth. Customs and Excise duties to be uniform, and intercolonial free-trade established within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, after which period the Federal Government shall have exclusive power to levy such duties and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods. Western Australia may continue duties in force on intercolonial goods at the establishment of uniform tariff for five years, subject to reduction of one-fifth each year.
- Of the net revenue from Customs and Excise not more than one-fourth to be applied by Commonwealth towards its expenditure. This holds good for the first 10 years and thereafter until the Parliament provides otherwise (Braddon clause).
- Right of States to reasonable use of river waters for conservation or irrigation reserved.
- Inter-State Commission provided for to regulate trade and commerce, and prevent discriminations being made by any State which may be deemed unreasonable or unjust to any other State.
- Constitutions, powers, and laws of States protected. State Debts may be taken over.
- Admission of new States provided for. Commonwealth to protect States against invasion or domestic violence.
- Seat of Government to be in New South Wales, not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and to be within Federal territory. Parliament to meet at Melbourne until it meets at the new capital.
- An alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of any State, or the minimum number of representatives of a State, or altering its limits, or in any way affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation to it, shall not become law without the approval of a majority of the electors of such State.
- The financial portion of the Act is too intricate to be briefly summarised. See Sections 81-106 of the Act.
- Constitution may be altered by an absolute majority of each House; then to be submitted to electors, and if in a majority of States a majority of electors voting approve, also majority of all electors approve, then the change may be made. In case of a dead-lock between the two Houses, renewed after three months' interval, the Governor-General may submit the question to the electors in each State qualified to vote for the Lower House.
- Two questions, both dealing with finance, were submitted to a referendum concurrently with the Federal elections of April 13th, 1910. The first provided that the Commonwealth should take the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise, and pay to the States a sum equal to one pound five shillings per annum per head of their population, to be determined according to the latest available Commonwealth statistics. A special payment was to be made to Western Australia, in view of the large contribution per capita made by that State to the Customs revenue. It was intended that this arrangement should take the place of the Braddon clause but it was rejected by the electorate. The second proposal related to the conversion of the State debts.
Constitution provided for the conversion of all the debts existing at the time of Federation, and it was the object of the second proposal to amend the Constitution so as to give the Commonwealth unlimited power to assume all State debts existing at any time. This was passed but the Commonwealth has not yet taken advantage of the powers thus conferred upon it.

Two more "proposed laws" for the alteration of the Constitution were submitted to a referendum on 26th April, 1911. They were:

A Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) 1910, and

B Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) 1910.

The object of A was to extend the legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament in four directions: (a) Trades and Commerce (b) Corporations (c) Industrial Matters and (d) Trusts and Monopolies. The result would have been a great change in section 51 of the Constitution. The object of B was to give the Commonwealth the power of making laws for, or assuming control of, any business or industry which was declared by resolution of both Houses to be the subject of any monopoly. Both resolutions were rejected by a large majority. At the general election of 1913 (May 31st), six questions were submitted to referendum; each question representing a proposed alteration of the Constitution, on which the electors were asked to decide. Of these, five were the old questions of 1911 re-submitted, and the sixth dealt with railway disputes. All the proposals were again rejected but by much smaller majorities than in 1911.

It will be observed from the summary given above that the Constitution follows that of the United States rather than that of Canada so far as the distribution of Federal and State powers is concerned. The matters belonging to the Commonwealth are limited to those expressly specified, and in other respects State powers are maintained. But its general political scheme rests on the doctrine of the constant responsibility to Parliament of an Administration formed with the approval of the Representative of the Crown.

The Governorships of the States are still filled by the Crown, and the Governors correspond on State business directly with the Secretary of State. The Governor-General is, however, kept informed of the correspondence passing between the Governors of the different States and the Colonial Office.

Legislation, &c.

Up to the present time the Parliament of the Commonwealth has sat in Melbourne, the State Parliamentary buildings being assigned to them, and the State Parliament occupying the Exhibition building in that city. The selection of a site for the capital of the Commonwealth (which under the Constitution Act must be in N.S.W. but not less than 100 miles from Sydney) has been under active consideration, and in 1908 it was decided in both Houses that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be at Canberra, N.S.W.

The subjects engaging the attention of the Federal Parliament have been numerous and important. In 1901 among other measures the following Acts were passed: the Customs Act, the Post and Telegraph Act, the Immigration Restriction Act, and the Pacific Island Labourers Act, the last having the effect of putting an end within a definite time to the employment of Kanaka labour in Queensland.

The Tariff was provisionally brought into effect, and inter-state free trade established in October, 1901, but the discussion extended over the greater part of the following year, when the Act was finally passed, uniform customs duties being imposed by the Customs Tariff Act, 1902. The Public Service and Electoral Acts and other measures were also passed into law in 1902; and further provision was made for the Governor-General's establishment. The Commonwealth Franchise Act, providing for a uniform federal franchise on the basis of adult suffrage, was also passed.

Sir E. Barton, then Prime Minister, visited England in 1902, and attended the King's Coronation as Representative of Australia. He took part in the Colonial Conference held in London at that time, as also did Sir John Forrest, then Commonwealth Minister of State for Defence.

In 1903 the Judiciary Act was passed organising the High Court of Australia as provided for in the Constitution. It provides for a Chief Justice and two other Justices. (The Judiciary Act of 1906 provides for two additional Justices, and a similar Act of 1912 for a further two.) It confers upon the High Court certain original jurisdiction in addition to that conferred by the Constitution, and makes the original jurisdiction of the Court exclusive in certain cases. It also regulates and defines the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, and provides that in matters of Federal jurisdiction there shall be no appeal from the State Courts to the Privy Council except through the High Court. The High Court Procedure Act, 1903, establishes a system of procedure for the Court.

The Naval Agreement Act, 1903, ratifies the agreement entered into between the Admiralty and the Governments of the Commonwealth and of New Zealand, providing for an increased Naval Force on the Australian Station. In 1909, the establishment of an Australian Fleet Unit was decided upon. Part of this Unit has now taken the place of the squadron previously maintained under the agreement. There were also passed in 1903 a Naturalisation Act, an Extradition Act, a Patents Act, a Defence Act and other measures.

In 1904 a comprehensive measure relating to Navigation and Shipping was introduced into the Federal Parliament, and was referred to a Royal Commission. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, applying to labour disputes, was the subject of much discussion. An amendment applying the Bill to State employés was carried against the Government, and Mr. Deakin, who had succeeded Sir E. Barton as Prime Minister, resigned. Mr. Watson, who then formed a Government, was in turn defeated in connection with the same Bill, and Mr. Reid became Prime Minister in August. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed in December, 1904. There was also passed an Act relating to the sea-carriage of goods—somewhat on the lines of the "Harter Act" in the United States—which prevents shipowners from contracting themselves out of liability for negligence. The Defence Act, 1904, instituted a Council of Defence and Boards of Naval and Military Administration. The offices of Inspector-General of the Military Forces and Director of Naval Forces were created. Other measures of minor importance were enacted in 1904.

In 1905 several important measures were passed. Amongst these were the Papua Act, granting a constitution to British New Guinea; the Trade Marks and Copyright Acts, making uniform laws throughout the Commonwealth in regard to trade marks and copyrights; the
Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act, to prevent the application of false trade descriptions to imports and exports; the Secret Commissions Act, to prevent the receipt of secret commissions and rebates by agents; and the Census and Statistics Act.

In 1906, amongst other measures, was passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which is directed against injurious trusts and monopolies and unfair competition with intent to injure Australian industries, and which also contains provisions to prevent "dumping"; the Designs Act, which deals with copyright in industrial designs, and, in conjunction with the Patents and Trade Marks Acts, previously passed, completes the legislation for the protection of industrial property; an Act increasing the number of the Justices of the High Court of Australia from three to five; an Act granting a reciprocal customs preference to the Colonies and Protectorates forming the South African Union; special Customs and Excise Tariff Acts relating to Agricultural Machinery; a new Excise Tariff on Spirits; a Spirits Act, providing for the proper description and maturing of spirits for human consumption, and affording facilities for the use of spirits in the arts and manufactures, in scientific investigation, and for lighting, heating, and power purposes; and a Meteorology Act.

The principal enactments of 1907 provided for the taxation by States of salaries earned under the Commonwealth; the settlement of questions regarding Parliamentary qualifications and vacancies; the increase of salaries of members of Parliament from 400l. to 600l. per annum; the payment of bounties for the production of cotton, fibres (jute, flax and hemp), oil materials, rice, rubber, coffee, tobacco leaf, preserved fish, and dried fruits, and for the export of combed wool or tops. The survey of route for a transcontinental (Kalgoorlie, W.A., to Port Augusta, S.A.) railway was also authorised.

The more important measures of 1908 were Acts providing for the isolation, detention, protection, etc., of vessels, persons, goods, animals, and plants; and the prevention of the introduction or spread of diseases or pests affecting men, animals or plants; the authorisation of the publication of Parliamentary papers by either House of Parliament, and the exemption from legal proceedings of the publisher. The Customs and Excise Tariffs amended the duties of customs and excise as from 8th August, 1907, the former providing for British preference. The Surplus Revenue Act deleted the provision of the 93rd section of the Constitution, and substituted fresh provisions for the payment of surplus revenue by the Commonwealth to the States. Special appropriations were made, whereby an Invalid and Old Age Pensions Fund and a Harbour and Coast Defence (Naval) Account was created; and the payment of Invalid and Old Age Pensions as from 1st July, 1909, (or such earlier day as is fixed by Parliament) was enacted. By the Seat of Government Act, Canberra was determined as the site of the Commonwealth capital. Authority was given by the Manufacturers Encouragement Act to pay bounties for iron, steel and wire manufactures.

A very important measure of 1909 extended the provisions of the Defence Act, decreeing compulsory training, for defence, of male inhabitants of the Commonwealth, and the necessary registration and enrolment; the establishment of a Military College was also enacted. Other important measures were those extending the operation of the Old Age Pensions Act; repressing commercial monopolies; authorising the issue of silver and bronze coinage; constituting the office of High Commissioner of the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom; regulating marine insurance; providing for payment of compensation by employers to seamen injured while at work, etc. Industrial organisations are recognised, an employer being forbidden to dismiss an employee on account of his membership of an association, that is, or is applying to be, registered as an organisation; nor is an employee to cease work on account of a corresponding application by his employer. Amending Election and Patents Acts were also passed.

In 1910 provision was made for payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for pensions and Naval Defence. The establishment and maintenance of an Australian navy was also provided for, and the period of service under the defence scheme lengthened. Authority for the administration of the Federal Capital Territory and for the Northern Territory was given. The elimination of the words "as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth," altered the provisions of the Constitution relating to the taking over of the States' debts. Provision was made for the issue of Australian notes by the Commonwealth Treasurer, and for the issue of Treasury bills for the redemption of the notes, bank notes being taxed; postal rates were amended. Payment of bounties was authorised on the manufacture of kerosine and paraffin wax from Australian shale. Severe penalties were imposed, under the Immigration Restriction Act, upon persons concerned in bringing immigrants secretly to the Commonwealth, or guilty of deception in regard to naturalisation papers. Emigration of aboriginals, and of children under theatrical contracts was prohibited. Restrictions were placed upon the exportation of arms, military and naval stores, goods necessary for the preservation of the Australian fauna and flora, and articles not conforming to the prescribed conditions as to purity and soundness. A progressive land tax was imposed upon unimproved values. Jurisdiction was given to the High Court in constitutional matters referred to it by the Governor-General. The president of the arbitration court was given power to convene a compulsory conference, to direct that preference be given to Unionists, or to prescribe a minimum wage.

In 1911 provision was made for statutory declarations in connection with any Commonwealth Act, Ordinance or Statutory regulation or in connection with the administration of any Commonwealth Department. The Commonwealth also agreed to accept the Petherick Collection of books, pamphlets, etc., dealing with the geography and history of Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. The President of the Arbitration Court is given greater powers to deal with the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. Provision is made for the building of a railway from Kalgoorlie in Western Australia to Port Augusta in South Australia. The rates of postage in favour of Australian books and magazines was altered, and power is given to the Postmaster-General to acquire private telephone lines. The public servants of the Commonwealth are given the power to resort to the Arbitration Court for the settlement of claims relating to salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms or conditions of service or employment of members of public service associations. Compensation to seamen
in respect of injuries in the course of their employment is provided for. Power is given to the Commonwealth to acquire and control lighthouses. Minor amendments were made in the Defence and Naval Defence Acts. Under the amending Electoral Act postal voting is abolished and provision is made for signature of articles issued during an electoral campaign and for the return of wages expended by organisations in an electoral campaign. Provision is made for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank and for the issue of inscribed Stock. Certain anomalies in the tariff are rectified. The gold reserve under the Australian Notes Act is altered to one-fourth of the amount of notes issued. The construction of the portion of the Pacific Cable between New Zealand and Australia is sanctioned. The Public Service Act is amended by making more liberal provisions in respect of payments in lieu of furlough on retirement or death.

The legislation of 1912 includes an amplification and extension of the powers of Royal Commissions. The number of justices of the High Court is increased by two, the Bench now consisting of the Chief Justice and six justices, all of whom must adjudicate upon questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. Under the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution (see page 4, supra), an Inter-State Commission is instituted. The Commission consists of three members, and is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and common seal, &c. A Directorship of Quarantine is instituted, and the scope of quarantine considerably extended. Medical examination of intending immigrants as to physical and mental fitness is prescribed, and immigration of undesirables is further restricted. Permanent incapacity through blindness and certain other causes entitles the sufferers to invalid pensions. Maternity allowance of £5 was instituted. Injuries to seamen and to manual and clerical employees of the Commonwealth must be compensated at rates laid down. Bounties on wood pulp and rock phosphate, and rewards for the discovery of rock phosphate are provided. Bounties payable under the various Acts may be withheld from claimants where the conditions of employment and rates of wages are below the standard declared by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The Sugar Excise and Sugar Bounty are repealed. (Note.—It was indicated that the Government of Queensland would deal with the matter.) The survey of a railway route from Pine Creek to Katherine River (Northern Territory) is authorised. The electoral machinery is extended to cover the taking of a referendum. Designs and trade marks legislation is extended to Papua. The British Copyright Act, modified to suit local circumstances, is adopted, and machinery for registration is instituted. Financial assistance is rendered to Tasmania by a grant of £500,000, payment being spread over ten years. Arrangements are made for the reduction of the British-Australian Squadron, and the consequent reduction of the naval subsidy. The method of prosecution of delinquents and the enforcement of penalties under the Defence Act are simplified, and the prescribed training of junior cadets is reduced by one-fourth.

By the legislation of 1913, the relations of service between owners and masters of vessels and their crews are regulated by provisions for the health, protection, and welfare of the seamen. Sugar excise and bounty are fixed. Norfolk Island is accepted as a Commonwealth Territory. Extension of the Northern Territory Railway is authorised. Transmission of letter-telegrams is instituted. Provision is made for payment in respect to judgments against the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom. Joint Parliamentary Committees of public accounts and of Commonwealth public works are established—the former to examine and make recommendations to Parliament in regard to public accounts, the latter to consider and report upon the larger public works proposed. Further financial assistance is rendered to Tasmania by a grant of 400,000L. The raising of 2,780,000L. on loan for certain prescribed purposes is authorised.

In 1914, many new measures were enacted. Trading with the enemy is restricted. Documents may be impounded and controllers appointed for enemy firms and companies. Exportation of goods may be prohibited. The issue of Treasury bills is authorised. Duties are imposed on estates of deceased persons, and landed estates are further taxed. A war loan from the Imperial Government is authorised. War pensions are arranged. A grant of 100,000L. is made in aid of the Belgian Government. Machinery for detection of crimes, and for apprehension, indictment, and punishment of offenders, is provided, special prominence being given to offences in connection with the defence and safety of the Empire. (In 1915 it was enacted that this statute should continue in force during the continuance of the war and for six months thereafter, and no longer.) Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is conferred on the High Court. The Commonwealth Bank is authorised to take over business of other banks. Manufacture of pig-iron from Australian ore is encouraged by the provision of a bounty.

Further war measures are the chief features of the legislation of 1915. A Ministry of State for the Navy is created, salary being provided by the addition of 1,600L. to the 12,000L. annually appropriated for salaries of Ministers. Taking of a war census is prescribed. A war loan of 20,000,000L. is authorised. An income tax is imposed. Lighthouses may be acquired by compulsory process from States not agreeing to transfer them. Acceptance of Jervis Bay Territory (Naval College) is arranged. Trial by jury is prescribed for indictable offences. The Murray Waters agreement is ratified. A further war loan of 18,000,000L. is authorised.

During 1916, further war measures are passed. Authority is given to raise 50,000,000L. for war purposes, and to borrow 25,000,000L. from the United Kingdom. The War Pensions' Act is amended, and the Trading with the Enemy Acts also amended.

The necessary appropriations have also been made by the Parliament for the services of the various years.

Commonwealth Departments.

The Customs and Excise Departments of the States were transferred to the Commonwealth Government on the 1st of January, 1901, and the Defence and Post and Telegraph Departments on the 1st of March, 1901. Other departments which have been created are those of Home and Territories, the Attorney-General's Department, the Treasury, the Prime Minister's Department, the Works and Railways Department, the Navy and the Repatriation Department.

Public Debt of Australia, 30th June, 1917.

The referendum of 13th April, 1910, gave power to the Commonwealth, at any time to assume all the State debts existing at that time. The distinction which formerly existed between the debts which could be taken over under the Constitution, and those which could not, consequently exists no longer. The following table shows the complete indebtedness of the States and Commonwealth at 30th June, 1917. In addition to the amount shown below, the Commonwealth owes £10,789,738 (included in the State debts) being the value of properties transferred from the States to the Commonwealth.

NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.

The State of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 154th meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the State of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the State follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the State is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the State follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 141st meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary, the Dumaresq; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dumaresq. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence, almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area comprised within these limits is estimated at 310,367 square miles (inclusive of Federal Capital area at Yass-Canberra—900 square miles), or 198,635,000 acres, being a little over two and a half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area would be 195,669,000 acres, or about 305,733 square miles.

The length of the State, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 683 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 756 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 850 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' 41" S. lat., and 151° 12' 23" 10" E. long.
Of the total area of the State, 59,487,478 acres have been alienated, or were in process of alienation on the 30th June, 1916.

The number of Alienated Holdings over one acre in extent for the year ended 30th June, 1916, were:

**History.**

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, and gave it the name of New South Wales, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, at Port Jackson, under Captain Phillip, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The population in 1800 was 4,908. The Merino sheep was introduced in 1797. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. Moreton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 36,598. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland.

On the 1st January, 1901, the Colony of New South Wales united with the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, in a Federal Commonwealth of Australia.

**Climate.**

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean in shade in 1916 was 44°6', to Bourke, 68°6', Brewarrina, 67°6', Moree, 67°0', and Walgett, 66°3'. On the coast it varied from 53°8' at Bradwood to 68°8' at Grafton, Sydney being 63°4'. On the mountains snow lies in a few places all the winter. At Bathurst the mean temperature was 58°2', and on the central plains about 66°0'.

Average annual rainfall 48°01 inches to end of 1916 (58 years' experience), and 44°92 inches during 1916 (on 161 days). The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The total fall during 1917 at Sydney was 52°42 inches; and the days on which rain fell 193. The average rainfall is about 48 inches annually. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day. Seventy-five years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

**Trade and Industry.**

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The direct export of wool, the produce of the State, to countries outside Australia during the past years has been as follows:

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1908 | £11,219,666 |
| 1909 | £11,654,400 |
| 1910 | £13,599,582 |
| 1911 | £11,704,409 |
| 1912 | £11,496,850 |
| 1913 | £11,284,688 |
| 1914-16 | £9,755,675 |
| 1915-16 | £13,703,232 |

The other principal exports of domestic produce to countries outside Australia are:—Silver and silver lead bullion, coal and coke, cattle, sheep, horses, skins and hides, tallow, meats, leather, tin, fruit, copper, shale (kerosene), butter, flour, wheat, bran, pollard, etc., timber, oils, boots and shoes. In addition to these products, tobacco, sugar, many kinds of fruit, and other commodities are produced largely for home consumption.

The live stock on 30th June, 1917, was estimated as follows:—Horses, 738,791; cattle, 2,765,943; sheep, 36,196,383; pigs, 359,763.

The coal mines have steadily advanced since 1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is given as 433,889 tons, valued at 236,230l., while in 1881, 1,769,597 tons, valued at 603,248l., were raised from 40 mines; and, in 1915, 9,449,008 tons,
valued at £3,424,630l., were raised from 112 mines. In 1917, 8,202,867 tons, valued at £3,336,419l., were raised from 126 mines.

Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry; 17 vessels, of a total tonnage of 8,501, were registered during the year ended 30th June, 1917, while the total number of vessels on the registers at 30th June, 1917, was 1,117, with a tonnage of 136,368.

Manufactories and Works.

In 1916-17 there were 5,356 manufactories and works, employing 117,997 persons, of whom 88,910 were males and 29,087 females. The total value of plant and machinery was £20,364,122l.; the total salaries and wages paid amounted to £14,381,309l.; and the value of the output was £6,944,320l.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at which gold was received during 1917 to the extent of £1,739,947l.

The 17 banks operating in the State in 1917 were:—Bank of New South Wales; Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, Ltd.; Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Ltd.; Australian Bank of Commerce, Ltd.; London Bank of Australia, Ltd.; English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Ltd.; Queensland National Bank, Ltd.; Bank of Queensland, Ltd.; Bank of New Zealand; Commercial Bank of Australia, Ltd.; National Bank of Australasia, Ltd.; Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris; Royal Bank of Australia, Ltd.; Colonial Bank of Australasia, Ltd.; Commonwealth Bank of Australia; and Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. Total average amount of deposits in banks for June quarter, 1918:

| Deposits bearing interest | £36,126,228 |
| Deposits not bearing interest | £46,125,775 |
| **Total** | **£82,252,003** |

The average note circulation for the same period was £73,615l., the decrease of late years being due to the issue of the Commonwealth notes.

The Savings Bank of New South Wales, established in 1832, and the Government Savings Bank, established in 1871, which were formerly conducted separately, were amalgamated on the 1st May, 1914. The number of depositors on the 30th June, 1917, was 872,351, and the value of deposits, £40,836,747l. These figures include transactions of the Savings Department of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Interest is allowed at the rate of 3½ per cent. per annum on all deposits up to £50l.

Means of Communication.

On the 30th June, 1918, there were 4,679 miles of railways, owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been £75,050,450l. The receipts during the year ended 30th June, 1918, were £8,954,880l., and the working expenses £5,910,447l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being £3,014,433l. There were also 142 miles of private railway, exclusive of other branch lines connected with coal and other mines. There were also 225 miles of Government tramways, earning £1,992,641l., against working expenses amounting to £1,603,260l. The total capital expenditure on tramways was £8,470,091l.

Telegraphs.

There are 2,231 stations, and the revenue received during the year ended 30th June, 1917, was £353,040l. from telegraph, and £618,850l. from telephone.

The following are the numbers of telegrams transmitted and received in New South Wales during 1916-17:

| Transmitted |
| --- |
| Outside New South Wales | ... | ... | 1,275,048 |
| Inland | ... | ... | 3,864,373 |

| Inland | ... | ... | 3,864,373 |
| **Total** | ... | ... | **5,216,306** |

Of inland rivers the Murray, Darling, Murrumbidgee, and Lachlan are navigable most of the year, and nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, the Macleay, the Manning, the Hunter, the Hawkesbury, and the Shoalhaven, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. In normal times steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Brindisi), the Orient Royal Mail lines (via Suez and Naples), and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles), Canadian Australian line (via Vancouver), Oceanic line (via San Francisco), White Star line (via Durban and Capetown), Aberdeen line (via Natal and Cape-town), Federal, Houlder, Shire and Bucknall lines (via Suez). Prior to the outbreak of war, Seven mails per month were sent to and dispatched from England.

Letters from England reach Sydney in about 31 days in normal times.

The number passing through the Post Office in 1916-17 was:

| Letters and Postcards | ... | ... | 259,185,729 |
| Newspapers | ... | ... | 68,546,782 |
| Packets and Book Parcels | ... | ... | 28,230,715 |
| Parcels | ... | ... | 2,906,090 |

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Public Instruction Act of 1880. Teachers in State schools belong to the Public Service and are paid fixed salaries according to their qualifications and the classifications of their schools. Fees in State primary and superior public schools were abolished from the 8th October, 1906, and State High School fees were abolished at the close of 1910. Education is compulsory between the ages of 7 and 14 years.

At the close of 1917 there were 3,221 State schools divided into 21 high schools, 6 for boys, 5 for girls and 10 mixed; public schools, 1,983; provisional
schools, 476; half-time schools, 161; house-to-house schools, 1; travelling schools, 3; evening continuation schools, 43; subsidised schools, 531; and industrial and reformatory schools, 2. The State has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district or sub-district. School buildings are erected and maintained wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction is imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective Churches to pupils belonging to the same religious persuasion. Children are conveyed to central schools, and in very thinly-populated remote districts subsidies are paid either to families who combine and engage teachers, or to single families of 4 children and upwards: in the latter case it may take the form of assisting to board the children near existing schools. Three properly equipped travelling schools convey a means of instruction to several outlying groups in rotation. All children are carried free by rail to the nearest school, while conveyances are subsidised by the Department to carry pupils residing in an outlying district to a Central School.

Three hundred and sixty Bursaries, each tenable for four or five years at a High or District School, were awarded in 1917. Hitherto 600 Scholarships were awarded each year. These Scholarships, which carried a free grant of text books have been discontinued, as free text books are now supplied to all High School pupils. Agricultural Scholarships, Technical Scholarships, and thirty University Bursaries are also awarded. A Higher Education Scheme has been established which provides for the award of (1) Qualifying Certificates which denote that pupils have undergone a primary course of instruction and are eligible to receive higher instruction either in the High or District Schools, or in the advanced classes of the superior Public Schools. (2) Intermediate Certificates issued on the satisfactory completion of a two years' High School course, and (3) Leaving Certificates (equivalent to the University Matriculation Certificates) awarded on the satisfactory completion of a four years' High School course. Twenty-one High Schools and an Agricultural High School are in operation. Probationary student Scholarships are provided for young persons desiring to enter the Public Service as teachers, and the Training College affords a one-year or two-years' course of training for State school teachers. In special cases longer courses are provided for. Classifications are awarded on attainments and practical skill. During 1915, 459 students underwent courses of training. In addition, 335 students were received during the year into a short (12 months') course of training preparatory to taking charge of small bush State Schools, or of receiving appointments as assistants in country schools. During 1912 the "Bursary Endowment Act" was passed by Parliament. This Act provides for the establishment of a fund for Bursaries tenable in secondary schools and in the Sydney University and for the constitution of a Board of Control. The first set of Bursaries (300) awarded under this Act took effect from 1st January, 1913.

Evening Continuation Schools have been brought into operation in city and country centres divided into the following classes: (1) Junior Technical Schools; (2) Commercial Schools—in both cases the object being to assist lads to push on more rapidly in the callings they have chosen; and (3) Domestic Schools, for girls only.

For the year 1917 the net cost to the State of public instruction was £1,871,391/. 10s. 4d., exclusive of £110,795/. 19s. 2d. expended on technical education.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1850. Its State endowment was originally £5,000/, and from 1890 to 1892 was £13,900/, but it has recently been increased to £20,000/. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The State endowment and special grants for 1917 amounted to £60,438/. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of £500/ per annum. In addition, there is the women's college, also affiliated, having a similar endowment. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, engineering, agriculture, veterinary science and dentistry. Recently, several faculties have been added to its curriculum. During 1912 the University Amendment Act was passed the main provisions being representation of the Government and of Parliament upon the Senate; the broadening of the franchise; voting by post; the acceptance of the Leaving Certificate of the Education Department as the equivalent of Matriculation, the institution of Evening Tutorial Classes, and the provision of 200 Exhibitions annually exempting the holders from payment of fees.

In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, with an enrolment of 684 pupils, and having a State endowment of £1,500/. There are also technical colleges, under the Department of Public Instruction, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns. The Central College—a large establishment—is extensively equipped and staffed for trades, professional, and scientific instruction. The fees are within the reach of all, and the colleges are open to males and females alike. There is an Australian Museum, a National Art Gallery, a Public Library, including the Mitchell Library, with endowments of £1,000/, £2,000/, and £2,000/, respectively, and a Music Library. Public libraries and schools of arts are established throughout the State and obtain Government subsidies. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, a Geographical, and an Art Society, a Government Observatory, Agricultural and Forestry Museum, and a Mining and Geological, and Technological Museums, Government Agricultural Colleges, Experimental Farms, with many other educational associations.

Local Government.

Local Government throughout New South Wales is governed by the Local Government Acts, 1906-1916.

The greater part of the State is incorporated, leaving only the "Western Division," which is but sparsely settled, outside the scope of these Acts, though even in that division there are a few towns which, having been incorporated as Municipalities under the Municipalities Act of 1897, repealed, are governed by the Local Government Acts.

There are two kinds of Local Government organisation—viz., Shirea and Municipalities. Speaking generally, the Municipal form of organisation is applied to towns, the Shire form to the open country outside the towns. There are 136 Shires and 184 Municipalities.
**Shires.**

The Shires were incorporated on 7th March, 1906. Each Shire is divided into three Ridings, with five exceptions, which upon reconstitution were each divided into six Ridings.

The First Council of a Shire consists of six members, each Riding, in Shires divided into three Ridings, electing two Councillors. In Shires divided into six Ridings, as in the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, each Riding elects one Councillor.

For the purpose of any later election the number of members may be increased from six to nine on resolution of the Council, or where such increase has been made may be decreased to six, provided that before any such increase or decrease is made the Council must take a poll of electors on the question, and the decision of a majority of the votes cast at such poll determines the question.

The election of Councillors is held triennially, the last election having taken place on 27th January, 1917.

Included amongst the primary functions imposed upon Shire Councils are the following:—The control of all roads, bridges, public watering places for travelling stock, and wharves and jetties, the lighting of streets, the regulation of traffic, etc. The Shire Councils may, under the Act, largely extend their powers, and take up many duties not at present part of their work, and many Councils are availing themselves of this provision in the Act.

To obtain the revenue they require, the Councils levy general rates not less than 1d., nor more than 2½d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of rateable land (i.e., the value the land would realise in the open market if it had no improvements on it, but with the rest of the surrounding district in its present state of development).

For special purposes Shire Councils may levy "special" or "local" rates, subject to the right of the ratepayers to demand a poll, at which the rate may be vetoed. Shire Councils are empowered by the Local Government (Shire Loans) Act, 1914, to borrow with the Governor's approval, up to thrice the amount of a year's income, for the purpose of carrying out any work which they are by law authorised to undertake.

On the petition of ten per centum of the ratepayers, the Council is required to submit the proposal to a poll of ratepayers, and if a majority of the votes cast at the poll is against the proposal, the borrowing cannot be proceeded with. Loans under the Shire Loans Act are a charge on the income of the General Fund.

Shire Councils may also obtain temporary accommodation to the extent of one-third of a current year's rate revenue.

In the case of portions of Shires which have been declared, by notification of the Governor to be "Urban Areas," the Shire Councils concerned may exercise all the powers of the Council of a Municipality, including the powers to borrow granted to Municipalities by the Local Government Act, 1906. This is intended to enable the financing of services and works required in unincorporated towns in Shires, where conditions akin to those of a Municipality obtain, but where the circumstances are not such as to warrant the incorporation of such centres as Municipalities. The question of whether any locality shall be declared an Urban Area is subject to a poll of the ratepayers of the locality concerned, in the event of such a poll being demanded.

To assist Shire Councils the Act provides that they shall be classified once every three years, and that not less than 150,000l. shall be distributed as endowment in accordance with the classification.

A sum of approximately 200,000l. is distributed amongst the Shire Councils annually for the upkeep of the main roads.

For the ten years previous to the passing of the Local Government Act, 1906, the Government of New South Wales levied a direct tax of 1d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of land, and this tax was taken into Consolidated Revenue. The Local Government Act provides that when a Shire Council levies a rate on the Unimproved Capital Value of land the Government land tax shall be suspended. The whole of the Shire Councils having levied such a rate, the land tax has been suspended throughout the whole of the area covered by the Shires.

**Municipalities.**

The Municipalities Act of 1867, and its Amending Acts, which were consolidated in 1897, have been swept away, and the Municipal organisation brought into line with that of the Shires. The new law came into force on 1st January, 1907, the day on which the newly elected Shire Councils took up their task.

The election of Aldermen is held once in three years, at the same time as the Shire elections. The last municipal election, however, which should in the ordinary course have been held on the 27th January, 1917, was postponed to the 30th June, 1917, to allow of the preparation of new rolls of electors. The old system of the retirement of one-third of the Aldermen each year has disappeared—all the Aldermen go out of office on the same day.

The functions of Municipal Councils under the old law were confined within certain very circumscribed limits, which they had outgrown owing to the rapid progress of the State and the growth of town life. The Local Government Act, 1906, makes provision for any Council to extend very widely its sphere of activity as necessity occurs, so that it is possible now for a Municipality to undertake the conduct of an infants' milk depot, or a public mortuary, or to regulate the erection of buildings or the sub-division of land for building sites, with many other powers.

The financial system also has been completely revolutionised. Under the old Municipalities Act all rates were levied on rental values. During the first year of the operation of the new Act this system was continued. From 1st January, 1908, all Municipal rates have been levied either on the Unimproved or Improved Capital Value. The whole of the General Purposes requirements may be provided for by a General Rate (which must not be less than 1d., and may be any higher number of pence in the £ within the limit given below) on the Unimproved Capital Value of rateable land. If the Council prefers, it may levy only part of General Purposes rates as a General Rate on Unimproved Capital Value, and the rest as an Additional General Rate on either the Unimproved Capital Value or Improved Capital Value. Similarly, any special, local or loan rates may be levied on either Unimproved Capital Value or Improved Capital Value as Council may decide. In all these cases, however, except in the case of General Rates, the ratepayers may demand a poll, and at the poll may...
decide whether the rate is to be on the Unimproved or the Improved Capital Value. With respect to special and local rates, the ratepayers at the poll may also decide whether the rate shall be levied at all.

The limit of all rates (general, additional general, special, local and loan) taken together is fixed by the Act at a sum calculated by taking 2d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value and 2s. in the £ on the assessed annual value. The products of these two calculations are added together; and the total which results is the limit beyond which a Council cannot levy rates. The limit under the old Municipalities Act was 2s. in the £ on nine-tenths of the rental value.

As to loans, the Local Government Act introduces the principle that wherever a Council proposes to borrow (except to repay an existing loan) they shall first submit the proposal to a poll of ratepayers. If the ratepayers at the poll approve of the loan, then before raising it a loan rate must be levied sufficient to pay interest and sinking fund contributions in respect thereof; and this rate must be continued until the loan is wholly repaid.

The law also provides for the introduction of uniformity into municipal accounts, the Government being empowered to make regulations prescribing the manner in which the accounts are to be kept.

Regulations made in pursuance of the Local Government Act require the accounts to be kept by double entry on a system of "Income and Expenditure." The accounts of municipalities in the past were, generally speaking, kept on a "Cash" System, by single entry.

In Municipalities, as in Shires, the State Land Tax disappeared on the Councils levying general rates on the Unimproved Capital Value of all rateable land.

A sum of approximately 50,000l. is distributed annually amongst the Municipal Councils for the upkeep of the main roads.

Constitution.

The first Legislative Council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers on H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council were appointed for five years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council at present consists of 71 members, who are not paid, with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry. All members are privileged to travel free over all Government Railways and Tramways.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880," consisted of 108 members, elected in 72 districts increased under the provisions of that Act, which provided for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population, and the "Wentworth Electorate Subdivision Act" to 141 members in 1891 for 74 districts. The qualification for election to the Assembly extended to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise was given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in district.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 100l., or of the annual value of 10l. respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district, any house of the annual value of 10l., or who shall hold, and for the said six months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

An Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1893, provided for the division of the State into 125 electorates, each represented by only one member. The new Act also abolished the property qualification and plural voting, and established the "one-man-one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalised subject, and who shall have resided in the State for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district for which he claims an elector's right, is qualified as an elector. As the qualification of electors who held Electors' Rights had been tested at Revision Courts, the residence necessary in the new district, on change of residence from one district to another, was reduced from three months to one month, during which period the elector is entitled to vote in the original electorate. Under this law the elections all take place on one and the same day. The first election under this Act took place on July 17th, 1894; the second on July 24th, 1895; the third on July 27th, 1898; and the fourth on July 3rd, 1901. Under an amending Act, passed in 1896, the franchise has been conferred on members of the police force, who are all in the employment of the State, and not controlled by local bodies.

The Electoral Acts were consolidated in 1902, and during that year the franchise was extended to women.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old Electoral Acts of 1858 and 1880, now repealed.

Early in 1904 the State was divided into 90 electorates, each of which has one member to represent it in the Legislative Assembly. The General Election, held in August, 1904, was the first election held after the new divisions had been made, and at which women exercised the franchise.

The electoral law was amended by the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1906, which abolished the system of elector's rights, and substituted therefor provisions for collection of Lists, the exhibition and revision of same before being printed as Rolls.

Under this Act a General Election was held on the 10th September, 1907. The Assembly lasts
for three years, unless previously dissolved. Members receive 500l. per annum each; and, in addition, they may also travel free over the Government railways and tramways in the State, and are provided with official stamped envelopes for the transmission of correspondence through the post.

The Parliamentary Elections (Second Ballot) Act, 1910, was assented to on the 31st August, 1910. It provides that if, as the result of the first ballot, the Returning Officer finds that no candidate has received an absolute majority of votes, a second ballot shall be taken between the candidate who has received the highest number of votes and the candidate who has received the next highest number of votes. It also provides for the revision of all supplemental rolls before every general election after the issue of the writs. The necessary residential qualification has been altered by this Act, so that a continuous residence of one year in the Commonwealth, six months at least of such period in the State and three months in the District is sufficient. The Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act, 1911, was assented to on 3rd October, 1911. It provides for an annual collection and revision of the Lists and consequent printing of the rolls, and that every person whose name so entered on the Lists is to receive a form of acknowledgment and every applicant for enrolment is to be notified by post if his name has been added to the roll or if his application has been refused. It also provides that an elector absent from the district for which he or she is enrolled may vote for that district at any polling place in any other electorate. The residential qualification has also been altered to six months in the Commonwealth, three months in the State, and one month in the district, and the hours of polling extended to seven o'clock in the evening. Also members of the Naval and Military service were given the franchise.

The electoral Acts were consolidated in 1912. The Naturalised Subjects Franchise Act, 1916, assented to on 17th April, 1916, disfranchised, during the continuance of the war and for a period of six months thereafter, all naturalised subjects of enemy origin, which was defined to mean a naturalised male or female British Subject who at the time of his or her naturalisation was a subject of a country with which the British Empire is at war.

The Legislative Assembly Continuance Act, 1916, assented to on 23rd November, 1916, extended the life of the then existing Parliament from three to four years.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.

Latitude, 31° 30' S. Longitude 159° 5' E.

This island lies 436 miles north-east from Sydney, and 300 miles from Port Macquarie, the nearest part of the Australian continent.

It was discovered on February 17th, 1788, by Lieutenant H. L. Ball, of H.M.S. "Supply," while on his way from Port Jackson to found a settlement at Norfolk Island. It is of volcanic origin and crescent shaped, about seven miles in length and from one-half to one-and-three-quarters in width, containing about 3,220 acres. It is of great beauty throughout and covered with a dense and most luxuriant vegetation, but from the peculiar bouldery character of the formation of the major part of its floor, it has scarcely more than 300 acres suitable for agriculture. The soil of these few acres is extremely rich, and will produce almost any sub-tropical vegetation.

No lands have been sold, and the people pay no rent, occupying the land upon sufferance only—the Government reserving the right of resuming whenever they may see fit.

The population in April, 1911, was 105. Very fair and comfortable accommodation can be obtained amongst the settlers. The natural beauties of the island render it most attractive to visitors. Fish are very plentiful, and good sport can consequently be had. During war conditions an eight-weekly steam service has been instituted by Burns, Philp and Co., under contract to the Federal Government.

The Island is a dependency of New South Wales and the Government of New South Wales have appointed a Board of Control consisting of the Hon. J. C. L. Fitzpatrick (Colonial Treasurer, &c.) Chairman; E. B. Harkness, Esquire (Under-Secretary, Chief Secretary's Office, &c.); and J. H. Maiden, Esquire, I.S.O., &c. (Director, Botanic Gardens, &c.)—Members. The Board take charge of the affairs of the Island, and the management and control of the Kentia palm seed industry. Lord Howe Island is the home of the Kentia palms, the hardiest and most beautiful palms in the world, and the seeds are collected and sold under the Board's direction. Thousands of bushels of these seeds are shipped annually to all parts of the world.
QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 3° south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, Point Danger passing Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, and embracing the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The western boundary line of the State, being it from the territory of South Australia, includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 670,500 square miles, or 429,120,000 acres (equal to three times the German Empire's area).

Early History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were settled in 1828, and squatters or ranchers, as they are termed in America, began to settle on rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, thrown open to colonisation until 1842, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants having responsible government from the time of proclamation declaring the Colony distinct.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 67°1', the extreme during 1917 being from 37°4' to 100°3'. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane was about 41 inches; the barometer 29°978.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater part of the Colony; it is a continuation of the Great Dividing Range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its length, and continues its course northerly to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 29th parallel of south latitude another range follows the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

The year 1902 witnessed the culmination of an unprecedented period of drought, and the reduced output of all primary products at that period resulted in general depression throughout the State.

Sugar growing is a very important industry. In 1917 there were 175,762 acres under cane, of which 108,707 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 2,704,211 tons of cane, which produced 307,714 tons of sugar at 94% net litre.

Maize was grown on 165,124 acres, and returned a yield of 4,188,586 bushels, but the local demand is so great that practically none is sent out of the State.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1917, 289 acres yielded 107,576 lbs. of cured leaf.

*In 1917 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 368 acres, which yielded 4,019 tons of tuber. A small proportion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Amongst other fruits bananas occupied 9,141 acres with a production of 1,356,837 bunches of fruit. Pineapples, 4,166 acres, with 944,282 dozen. Oranges, 4,301 acres, with 400,999 bushels, the total value of all crops for 1917 was £7,308,115.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, sparsely timbered but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, most of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. There is every prospect of the area of cultivation extending to the Burnett District and further west in the near future. In 1917, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 27,247 acres were mown for hay, and 127,815 acres yielded 1,035,268 bushels of grain, 16,509 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,969 squattting "runs."

*Outside Australia there are restrictions as to the term "Arrowroot." Although it is admitted that the product in Queensland—derived from "Canna Edulis"—meets all requirements, yet the term "Arrowroot" having been acquired by virtue of many years of trading, dealing with the product of another plant, namely "Maranta Arundinacea," the Queensland product has been practically prevented from entering the English market without such qualifications on the package as would prevent sale and exportation outside the Commonwealth.
or tracts of land, containing 311,581,200 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 103,222,092 acres are leased as grazing farms, homesteads, and under occupation licence.

Goods sent to other States of Australia are not now counted as exports.

In some items the details given are of practically no value. Notably gold, green fruit, sugar, etc., and a goodly proportion of other primary products which, being transhipped in other States, are not now counted to Queensland in official statements.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery, oils, &c. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important in the State. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mount Morgan mine—Gympie, Chillagoe, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in over twenty-six districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total production of gold during 1917 amounted to 179,305 fine ozs., value 761,639l.

Many other minerals are worked in the State. The principal of which and their value for 1916 were:

- **Tin.**—160,600l., the chief centres of production being Chillagoe, 13,882l.; Cooktown, 31,704l.; Herberton, 71,367l.; Kangaroo Hills, 9,142l.; and Stanthorpe, 30,580l.
- **Silver.**—40,774l. Burketown, 1,257l.; Charters Towers, 1,636l.; Chillagoe, 3,414l.; Cloncurry, 7,804l.; Etheridge, 2,581l.; Gympie, 918l.; Herberton, 11,242l.; Mt. Morgan, 8,522l.; Stanthorpe, 963l.; and Croydon, 707l.
- **Copper.**—2,208,232l. Chillagoe, 23,664l.; Cloncurry, 1,181,953l.; Etheridge, 8,584l.; Gladstone, 83,295l.; Herberton, 65,577l.; Mt. Morgan, 808,636l.; Mt. Perry, 20,416l.; MacKay, 7,105l.; Wolfram and Bismuth.—80,836l. Chillagoe, 40,904l.; Herberton, 35,181l.; Star River, 1,165l.; Molybdenite.—48,618l.; Chillagoe, 46,649l.; Star River, 870l.; Mt. Perry, 900l.
- **Fireclay.**—2,286l. Mt. Morgan, 2,286l.
- **Lead.**—14,407l. Burketown, 6,937l.; Etheridge, 3,015l.; Herberton, 2,790l.
- **Limestone.**—56,926l. Cloncurry, 30,992l.; Gladstone, 3,963l.; Rockhampton, 13,759l.; Chillagoe, 4,134l.; Biggenden, 2,020l.
- **Ironstone.**—23,611l. Rockhampton, 22,944l.
- **Scheelite.**—1,523l. Herberton, 1,523l.
- **Chrome Iron.**—756l. Rockhampton, 756l.

Total value of minerals other than gold, 3,261,338l. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1917 being of the value of 14,208l., whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area. At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burrun and Peak Downs, the Dawson Valley and the Darling Downs, whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1917 was 1,048,473 tons, valued at 597,360l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the State is popularly divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbutt, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, crows ash, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Bean tree, Kauri pine, Cypress pine, She pine, silky oak, satin wood, maple, &c., &c.

| TIMBER. | Super ft. |
|---------|-----------|
| Pine    | 70,465,436 |
| Cedar   | 197,753    |
| Hardwood| 32,101,330 |
| Other timber (mostly cabinet) | 8,898,048 |
| Number. | 418,956    |

N.B.—The quantity actually cut for all purposes is estimated at nearly double these quantities.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—*Dulosisa myoporoides*, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; *Austrom*

*All sent to Southern States for further treatment prior to exportation (see production).*
constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; *Euphorbia Drummondii*, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; *Euphorbia pilulifera*, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus has come largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1917, 291 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 26,722.

**Water Supply.**

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State, of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1917 an indebtedness to the Government of £1,798,155.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 670,500 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 3,061 artesian bores have been sunk with an aggregate depth of 563,722 miles; the depth ranges from a maximum of 5,610 feet, the depth of the bore at Springleigh; 1,146 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 430,341,990 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 270 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 210° to 81° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at about three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, so that not far short of a million sterling represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the State, and owing to the unfavourable season 4,462 acres were artificially watered last year. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but vegetables, fruit, and grass lands are similarly treated.

**Population.**

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51·20 per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population to be 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,939 females. The census of 3rd April, 1911, showed that there were 329,506 males and 276,307 females, making a total of 605,813, exclusive of 8,687 aborigines. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. The figures for 1911 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions. Population of State 30th June, 1918, 705,588 persons.

Practically the whole of the State is divided into local authority areas a few islands only being excluded, occupied by a population of about 1,500 persons. The receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1917 were £1,748,845.; their expenditure £1,754,777.; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control £2,048,507., excluding cost of construction of waterworks (£3,354,293.), and liabilities £3,691,531. Liabilities for water works, amounting to £1,906,259., which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given; assets, £5,380,813.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, on 31st December, 1917, an estimated population of 173,504 (ten mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy, and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (19,500), Ipswich (23,000), Maryborough (12,500), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (22,500), Gympie (8,500), Toowoomba (24,500), Charters Towers (14,050), Bundaberg (5,500), and M'Morgan (8,630). All these include an area of ten-mile radius, except Charters' Towers which is for a five-mile radius. (December, 1917.)

**Currency and Banking.**

There were, on 31st December, 1917, 10 banks, exclusive of the Commonwealth Bank, with 336 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £2,271,948.; deposits, £26,796,326. The State Government Savings Bank, on 30th June, 1917, with 475 branches return the number of depositors as 242,483; the amount of deposits as £13,498,437. Average value of each account 55l. 13s. 4d.

The Commonwealth Savings Bank, Queensland Branch, had on 31st March, 1918:

- No of Depositors: 65,638
- Value of Deposits: £2,741,729.
- Average Value of each A/c: 41l. 15s. 5d.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling. The Commonwealth has also silver coin in circulation and British coin is being gradually withdrawn, but some years will elapse before local coin is exclusively in use.

**Means of Communication.**

Queensland is divided for the purpose of Railway administration into three divisional railway systems, Southern, Central and Northern, in which on 30th June, 1918, there were altogether 5,438 miles of Government Railways open for traffic, being the longest mileage of open Railway in any Australian State, and 234 miles of Railways and Tramways of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge owned by private companies or Local Authorities.
which are either worked by or under the Commissioner's inspection. On 30th June, 1918, there were 496 miles of Railway under construction, and 1,335 authorised by Parliament but not yet commenced.

The Central and Northern Divisions are each in charge of Deputy Commissioners, subject to the control of the Commissioner at Brisbane.

From Brisbane main trunk lines run west and north. The former crosses the Main Range (2,000 ft. high) and shortly after passing Toowoomba at the entrance to the Darling Downs, 101 miles from Brisbane, bifurcates, one arm proceeding due west through pastoral and wheat growing country until it reaches Cunnamulla (604 miles from Brisbane), the other crosses the Darling Downs and passing through the granite district in which are many flourishing fruit orchards, terminates at Wallan-Garra on the New South Wales border (223 miles from Brisbane). Here connection is given with the mail train services to the southern capitals. Off the western and southern Lines there are 14 Branches, with a total length of 688 miles, serving rich agricultural and pastoral districts, and when the construction of the additional lines authorised into these areas is accomplished fact a vast increase in staple products due to closer settlement will result.

Within a radius of 100 miles from Brisbane there are 13 branch lines of 394 miles in length serving the suburban areas, seaside resorts, and rich agricultural and heavily timbered districts. One of these lines running due south meets the New South Wales border at Tweed Heads, 69 miles from Brisbane.

The Northern Trunk Line after leaving Brisbane follows the coast line for 397 miles to Rockhampton, passing through the towns of Gympie, Maryborough and Bundaberg and giving connection at the ports of Gladstone and Port Alma with the steamer services to the northern ports of the State. Off the Trunk Line there are ten branches, totalling 480 miles in length, serving agricultural, mineral and sugar lands, and heavily timbered districts.

The Central Line extends from the town of Rockhampton due west to Longreach, 428 miles, passing through pastoral country, with 8 branches of 390 miles of line into agricultural, pastoral and mineral areas, and to the port of Broadmount on the Fitzroy River, some 36 miles below the city wharves. North from Rockhampton the railway has been extended to Marlborough, a distance of 63 miles, and a further portion of this section of the North Coast Railway, which will, in time, link Cairns and Brisbane, is under construction towards St. Lawrence.

From the port of Mackay, 540 miles north of Brisbane, a short Line runs through the sugar growing country east of the Eungella Range, with three small Branches running north and south, a distance of 28 miles, into sugar country. In this district there are over 200 miles of light tramways into the sugar plantations and mills. From Mackay southward the coastal line has been constructed for a distance of 36 miles to Koumala, and a further section of 25 miles is being built to Carnil Creek, whilst north from Mackay, a section of 31 miles to St. Helens is in hand.

From the port of Bowen 645 miles north of Brisbane, a Line runs northward for 120 miles through pastoral and sugar growing country to the port of Townsville, and a branch line three miles from Bowen, 39 miles in length, runs southward into the rich sugar land of Proserpine. Both Lines will eventually form a link in the North Coast Trunk Line.

The Great Northern Railway which commences at the port of Townsville, 748 miles north of Brisbane, runs west for 481 miles through the well known mining town of Charters Towers, 82 miles from the Port, and from Hughenden (236 miles) the Line runs due west for over 200 miles through Northern Downs, pastured with millions of sheep, to the rich copper mining district of Cloncurry, thence with a southerly sweep to Malbon, where it bifurcates to the mining districts of Hampden, Mt. Elliott and the Duchess. North from Cloncurry another line, 60 miles in length, has been built to serve the Mt. Cuthbert Mineral District. At Hughenden a Line runs south-west to Winton, a distance of 132 miles, through fine pastoral country. At 54 miles from the Port another Branch runs south to the town of Ravenswood, until recently a flourishing mineral township; a portion of the Coastal Railway north of Townsville has been constructed.

In the far north over 900 miles from Brisbane from the port of Cairns, a line of Railway runs west over the Barron Ranges, past the famous Barron Falls, through some of the most picturesque tropical scenery in the world, through the wonderful timber scrub of Atherton, the mineral township of Herberton, to the rich table land at the heads of the Herbert and Johnstone Rivers. A Branch Line joining the Main Line 64 miles from Cairns runs along the Johnstone River through rich scrub lands. At Mareeba, 46 miles from the Port, the private line of the Chillagoe Company junctions with the Cairns Railway. This private line runs to Mungana, a distance of 103 miles, and 75 miles from this junction another line 143 miles in length serves the rich mineral fields of the Etheridge, whilst from Dimbulah another line of 30 miles taps the coal fields of Mt. Mulligan.

From Cairns another railway runs southward along the coast for a distance of 42 miles, serving some of the richest sugar producing lands in Queensland. The extension of this Line will form another section of the Main North Coast Trunk Line.

From Cooktown, the furthest Northern port on the Eastern Coast, a railway runs to Laura, a distance of 67 miles.

From Normanton in the Gulf country a railway runs to the mineral town of Croydon, a distance of 94 miles.

The Lines under construction in Queensland embrace a comprehensive scheme of linking up the ports on the Pacific coast by railway, and the building of a transcontinental railway connecting the termini of the railway systems in the far west.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict., No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1917 there were in operation 1,545 State (including 7 high) Schools, with an enrolment of 130,427 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 136 private schools, with 20,331 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 1,600 pupils on the roll. A University is now established with 4 professors, 25 lecturers,
etc., enrolment 213. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

Immigration.

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 123,276, and the departures to all countries 118,443, showing an excess of arrivals of 4,833 (including Expeditionary Forces).

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The Elections Act Amendment Act of 1906 provides for male and female adult franchise on residential qualification only, a twelve months' continuous residence in the State being the only proviso, subject to disqualifications for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 49 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act, of 1910, the State is divided into 72 districts, each returning one member, or a total of 72 members as previously.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.
That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. In 1869 the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Acts 24 and 25 Vict., c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, was also annexed to South Australia, but was on January 1st, 1911, taken over by the Commonwealth. It is known as the Northern Territory.

Kangaroo Island (90 m. by 25 m.; area 1,500 sq. m., 1,000 ft. highest point), Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast are included in the State.

Adelaide, the capital of the State, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

Early History.
The south coast of the State was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Stuart in 1829 discovered the Murray River and its upper tributaries. The South Australian Company, upon Wakefield's principles, was formed in England in 1834, under the Act mentioned above, and the first settlements were formed at Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in 1836. Copper was discovered 1842, by Menge. Responsible government was established in 1856. Sturt reached Port Darwin 1861, and the "Northern Territory" was added to the State in 1861 and 1863. (Since transferred to the Commonwealth Government.)
Commonwealth Government.)
Climate.

The rainfall at Adelaide averages 21 inches annually, mostly from May to October. It varies from 16 to 42 inches on the plains and hills respectively. The mean temperature 63°, the extreme range being from 33° to 111°.

The South Australian climate is very mild and healthy. There is a high birth rate and a low death rate, the former being 27 per 1,000 of population, and the latter only 10. The Infantile Mortality is about the lowest in the world, being just over 50 per 1,000 births.

General Government.

The Parliament of South Australia consists of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, created by the Local Act No. 2 of 1855-56, which was proclaimed on October 25th, 1856. This Act, commonly called the Constitution Act, was passed by virtue of the Imperial Act 13 & 14 Vict., cap. 59.

The Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as originally constituted, consisted of 18 and 36 members respectively. By the Local Act No. 27 of 1875, the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881, six members were added to the Legislative Council, and the Colony was divided into four electoral districts for the purpose of Council elections. In 1882 the House of Assembly was further increased to 52 members, representing 26 electoral districts; and by Act No. 450 of 1888, the Northern Territory was created an electoral district, returning two members, thus raising the number to 54. By Act 779 of 1901, the number of members was reduced from 31st March, 1902, to 18 in the Legislative Council and 42 (representing 13 districts) in the House of Assembly. The Northern Territory having been transferred to the Commonwealth Government, the Electoral Districts then numbered 12, returning 40 members. By Act 1148 of 1913 the assembly Districts were altered, and now number 19, returning 46 members.

The five electoral districts of the Legislative Council are—Central No. 1, Central No. 2, Southern, Midland and Northern, each returning four members. (Vide Section 10, Act 959 of 1908, and Section 15 of 1148 of 1913). Elections are conducted by ballot. (Vide Section 21, Act 959 of 1908.)

The quorum of the Council consists of ten members, including the President.

The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the King, and that he has resided in the State for three years. The qualification of a voter is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have resided in South Australia six months. As to other qualifications, see Act 1148, 1913. Members of both houses are paid 200/- per annum.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; 8 Districts returning 3 members each, and 11 Districts returning 2 members each. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be qualified and entitled to be registered as an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, a natural born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have lived in South Australia for six months. The total number of electors in 1918 for the Legislative Council was 94,971, of whom 23,461 were females, and 71,510 males, and for the House of Assembly 258,712, of which 132,043 were females, and 126,669 males. The session is usually from June to December.

The franchise for both Houses was extended to adult women by Act 613 of 1894.

Responsible government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature, who form the Cabinet, and are ex-officio members of the Executive Council.

Local Government.

There are 34 municipalities in the State, whose powers are regulated by the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1890." The governing body consists of Mayor, Aldermen (Aldermen are at present elected for City of Adelaide and some of the Suburban Corporations only), and Councillors, elected by the ratepayers, who also elect the Auditors. The Council has power to levy rates for municipal purposes only on all house and land property within the municipal area, but the question of raising a loan must be submitted to a general meeting of the ratepayers, and a poll must be taken if demanded by six ratepayers. There are also 149 district councils having somewhat similar powers. The aggregate annual assessment of the property within the municipal areas and District Councils amounts to 5,059,023/-, and the revenue in 1917 amounted to 513,689/-, and the expenditure to 494,314/-. In addition, the receipts for main roads amounted to 127,354/-, and the expenditure to 108,344/-.

Population.

The population of the State at the census of 1901, was 359,346 persons, and of 1911, 408,558. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are about 3,000. In 1911 there were 235 Chinese in the State. The immigration of Chinese is controlled by the Commonwealth Government under the Immigration Restriction Act, No. 17 of 1901. The population of the State on 30th Sept., 1918, was estimated to be 441,274. This excludes about 30,000 men on active service with the Australian Expeditionary Forces.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide, including the suburbs, on 3rd April, 1911 (census), were 192,294. On 31st December, 1916, they numbered 225,317.

About 85 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 28 per cent.

Education.

The University of Adelaide was founded by Royal Letters Patent in 1881, and an Act of the local Parliament in 1874. It was endowed by private munificence, aided by an annual grant of 5 per cent. on all sums contributed from private sources, and an endowment of land, the total amount of income for 1917 being 28,131/. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and music; the staff consists of 11 professors, 83 lecturers and assistants and teachers in the Conservatorium of Music. All classes are open to women. It had in 1917 309 undergraduates and 217 non-graduating students (exclusive of 292 students at the Conservatorium of Music), besides those attending extension lectures. Total expenditure, 26,390/-

In connection with the Art Gallery 2 Schools of Design have been formed, in which 800 student...
are instructed in painting and designing for technical purposes.

The School of Mines and Industries was established in 1889. It is supported by an annual parliamentary vote of about £9,000, and by school fees. Diplomas are awarded in mining, metallurgy, and mechanical engineering. The staff consists of about 70 officers and teachers. The students number 2,863, including about 350 children from public schools receiving instruction in domestic economy. There are in addition five Schools of Mines in the country at Gawler, Moonta, Kapunda, Port Pirie and Mount Gambier, with 1,400 scholars.

Primary, secondary and technical education is provided for by the Education Acts of 1875, 1878, 1879, 1891, 1905, and 1915, by which the management of public education is committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free from January 1, 1892, up to the compulsory standard, and it has been compulsory since 1876. In 1917 there were 885 schools, with 2,216 teachers, and 70,939 scholars. Included in these are 36 High (secondary) schools, with 143 teachers, and 3,198 scholars, and technical education is to be imparted in future.

The expenses of the Education Department for payment of teachers, etc., buildings, were during 1917, £396,902. The total expenditure from loan money on school buildings up to December 31, 1917, was £740,539.

Towards the maintenance of the South Australian Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, also country institutes (209 in number) the sum of about £20,000 is annually granted by the Government.

There are also 169 Private Schools with 703 teachers and 12,011 scholars.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the State consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, and Gladstone, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court; Local Courts of Insolvency at Port Augusta, Gladstone, Mount Gambier, and Moonta, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction in all the principal towns throughout the State with full Jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates, and Limited Jurisdiction, by Justices of the Peace; and Police Magistrates' Courts.

The number of persons convicted in the Supreme Court in 1917 was 59, approximately one in every 7,500 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

Eight banking institutions in addition to the Commonwealth Government Bank carry on business within the State, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland towns—numbering altogether 265 branches and agencies. Their names are: The Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Limited; National Bank of Australasia, Limited; English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Limited; Bank of Adelaide; Bank of New South Wales; Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited; and London Bank of Australia, Limited. The total average liabilities of the nine banks amount to (June, 1918) £19,297,914, and the total average assets to £17,217,418.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 28 branches and 278 agencies. The number of depositors on 30th June, 1918, was 280,295 and the total deposits amounted to £11,562,539. Rate interest paid to depositors, 4½ per cent.

The Commonwealth Savings Bank had 30,364 depositors and 1,310,038 deposits at the same date. Nearly 75 in every 100 persons of the population are depositors in savings banks, the deposits averaging about 30s. per head of population. The total deposits in Savings Banks and Banks of Issue amounted to £31,491,871, being 72½ per inhabitant.

Penny Banks.

Agencies at schools, 521; depositors, 27,049; deposits, 24,904.

Industry.

It may be roughly estimated that not more than 150,000 square miles of the area of the State, are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 300 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached 1,200 miles. Forty-eight counties have been proclaimed to 30th June, 1918, embracing 84,103 square miles, or 53,825,929 acres. The area outside the declared counties covers 295,967 square miles, or 189,418,880 acres. Of the area of the State only 14,107,188 acres have been or are being alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to about 90 acres for each male adult in the State about 115,000,000 acres being held under lease from the Crown. 3,179,169 acres are in process of alienation under systems of deferred payments. About two in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to leasing, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 20,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, etc.

About two-thirds the total area of land cultivated is cropped with wheat (for grain, hay and fodder), of which 3,112,479 acres were cultivated in 1916-17. The total area under cultivation was 5,118,607 acres. The following were the main crops grown in 1916-17:—Wheat, 45,745,064 bushels; oats, 1,839,541 bushels; barley, 1,734,420 bushels; hay, 615,050 tons; and the estimated value of the crops in 1916-17 was £3,838,432.
AUSTRALIA—SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

32l. 2s. 2d. per head of population. The value of breadstuffs exported to overseas countries averages over £3,000,000 annually.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry; 29,762 acres of land were devoted to this purpose in 1918. Wine made, 5,331,166 gals. There is a considerable export trade to overseas countries, chiefly Great Britain. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants; of the former 42,192 cwts., and of the latter, 51,924 cwts. were made in 1917-18. In 1916-17, 1,365,780 lbs. raisins and 1,653,114 lbs. currants were sent to overseas countries.

Almond trees (250,133) are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment. Apple trees, 1,033,080; apricot trees, 280,341; orange trees, 357,454; lemon trees, 41,910; pears, 219,933; plums, 196,947; peaches and nectarines, 312,112; cherries, 81,245; and also figs, quinces, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, walnuts, peanuts, etc. The principal kinds of fruits produced last season were as follows:—Apples, 43,462 cases; apricots, 169,950 cases; peaches, 104,124 cases; oranges, 203,915 cases; pears, 104,679 cases; and plums, 74,891 cases. The dried fruit production was as follows:—Apricots, 7,369 cwts.; apples, 1,243 cwts.; peaches, 4,065 cwts.; pears, 1,556 cwts.; and plums, 2,510 cwts.

The State possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive, 18,459 gallons of oil being expressed during 1916-17. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and superiority general over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a high position in the local market. 6,635 gallons of eucalyptus oil were distilled last year, and an export trade is being worked up.

Potatoes, onions, turnips, carrots, mangolds, pumpkins and melons, tomatoes, and practically all kinds of vegetables grow well in the State, their production in 1916-17 being valued at £18,074l.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. In 1917-18 there were 151,000 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 262,840; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 313,245; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to 6,229,519, whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 100,744 bales. Last year there were made 10,482,895 lbs. of butter, and 2,449,716 lbs. of cheese; and 6,591,064 lbs. of bacon and hams were cured. In normal seasons, large quantities of butter, frozen meat, etc., are exported to Europe, in addition to tallow and skins and hides.

The keeping of bees is generally carried on in conjunction with other pursuits, and the average annual production of honey is about 1,000,000 lbs.

South Australian wattle bark holds a high place in the market for tanning purposes, about 6,000 tons being stripped every year.

The number of manufactories is 1,286, employing 26,010 hands and 45,372 horse-power actually used. Wages paid 3,094,094l. Total value production 17,392,352l. Value of land, buildings, plant and machinery, 6,775,409l.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, and there are now many steam flour mills, saw mills, foundries, agricultural implement works, breweries, and factories for clothing, boots and shoes, saddlery, jams, aerated waters, soap and candles, fertilizers, joinery, cycles and motors, brushware, glassware, etc., etc. Several marble and slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened.

The gasworks of the State are nine in number, of which one is for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, one is at Glenelg, and the remaining six are in the principal country towns. There are also six electric supply companies.

The output of the electric and gas light and power establishments has increased from 293,215l. to 449,656l. or by 50 per cent. during the last five years.

278 vessels, of 74,073 tons, belonged to Port Adelaide.

Out of 8,533,912l. worth of produce exported overseas the value of breadstuffs amounted to 3,592,060l.; while wool represented 1,976,438l.; fruits and wine, 142,729l.; butter, 155,303l.; meats, tallow, etc., 104,454l.; concentrates and ores, 1,048,799l.; lead, pig, 454,438l.; bullion and specie, 439,250l.; copper, 173,700l.; zinc, 82,547l.; skins and hides, 204,378l.; animals, 17,663l.; leather, 42,837l.; manures, 29,111l.

The chief imports are textiles, sugar, alcohol, tea, hardware, and machinery, manures, paper, oils, timber and vehicles. The total external trade is 14,652,964l., far the larger part of which is with the United Kingdom, the bulk of the remainder being with other British Countries, the United States, France, Italy, Russia and Japan.

The chief copper mines are those at Moonta and Wallaroo; the chief gold fields, Arltunga, Angipena, Barossa, Blumberg, Echunga, Luxemburg, Mount Granger, Mount Pleasant, Mount Torrens, Nillinghoo, Tarcoola, Tectulpa, Ulooloo, Wadnaminga, Woolside, and Waukaringa, and Burrunide MacDonnell Ranges in the N.T. The minerals produced during the year 1917 were valued at 1,460,674l., the chief being copper 902,495l., gold 30,334l., salt 93,716l., and ironstone flux 359,723l.

The output of the smelting works has increased by 200 per cent. during the last five years, reaching 5,793,280l. in 1916-17, and our lime, cement and cement pipes establishments had an output of 38,988l.

Value of Production, 1916-17.

The crops produced in South Australia in 1916-17 were valued at 13,838,432l., and in addition the net factories output was 6,060,538l., wool (1917-18) 2,753,329l., minerals 1,460,674l., dairying and poultry 1,773,296l., fisheries 249,500l.
Means of Communication.

There are 44,000 miles of roads defined in the settled districts, the greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed from the General Revenue—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 10,590. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

The railways are all constructed and worked by the Government. The mileage opened for traffic in the State is 2,242, exclusive of the Port Augusta Oodnadatta railway, 478 miles, and the East West railway, 598 miles, which are controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Up to June 30th, 1918, the cost of construction and equipment reached £18,974,348. The receipts in 1917-18 were £2,331,549, and the expenditure £1,747,055. Working expenses average 60 percent of the gross revenue. Net revenue on cost, averages 5 percent. There is daily railway communication between Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, and bi-weekly between Perth.

The geographical position of South Australia necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. To accomplish this South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of telegraph, some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over £50,000, across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party. An additional wire has been erected at a cost of over £50,000. At present the railway reaches Oodnadatta, 888 miles north of Adelaide, and Pine Creek, 146 miles south of Palmerston, the intervening gap being 1,200 miles.

On the 30th June, 1917, there were 516 telegraph stations in the State, and the number of telegraph messages sent and received in 1916-17 was 3,570,906. There were 189 telephone exchanges, with 10,742 connections.

Internal water communication is afforded by the Murray River, on which steamers run for 2,000 miles. There is regular and frequent communication by mail steamers with all parts of Australasia as well as with Europe and San Francisco. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, Newspapers per ½ oz. each | Australasia | United Kingdom | All other Places |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| not exceeding 10 ozs., ½d.; every additional 10 ozs., ¼d. | 1d. | 1d. | 2½d. |

Public Debt, June 30th, 1918—£40,621,480.

TASMANIA.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide, the important colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 33' and 43° 39' S. lat., and 144° 39' and 148° 23' E. long.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Diemen's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1853. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British possessions, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian States.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1915 the highest shade temperature recorded was 61.7° and the lowest 46.7°. The mean range for the year was 54.2°. In 1915 rain fell on 198 days in the year, and the rainfall was a little more than 20.91 inches, the year being a very dry one throughout the island.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 2,806 miles of telegraph (with 4,374 miles of wire, including 408 of railway wires) open in the State. This excludes 432 miles of cable belonging to the Commonwealth Government. The total cost of telegraph and telephone construction up to 30th June, 1915, was 444,608l., the receipts for telegraphs in 1914-15 being 23,814l. Construction including railway telegraphs and telephones, 1915, 462,115l. There are also 11,201 (wire) miles of telephone. Revenue in 1915-6, 28,600l.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The number of messages received and despatched in 1915 was 746,017.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Launceston three times a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney twice a week. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and Melbourne, and Hobart and New Zealand every week. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamers from Sydney calling for fruit, also carry passengers. The steamer with mails from Melbourne to Colombo and London every week; time 32 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 40 days. The mail steamer via Vancouver, once a month. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Batavia, Aden, and Brindisi; every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 50 days.

Direct communication is also afforded by the steamers of the Shaw, Savile Co. and New Zealand Shipping Co., one vessel of each Company calling at Hobart every two weeks.

In addition to the above, mails are deposited by Messageries Maritimes de France.

There are 400 (in addition to 65 receiving offices) places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers |
|-----------------------------|
| Within Tasmania ... ... 1d. ... ½d. |
| Within Australasia ... ... 1d. ... ½d. |
| Also to the United Kingdom, overseas dominions, British colonies and protectorates (except the New Hebrides) 1d. ... |
| Europe, United States, etc... 2d. 1d. per ¼ oz. and ½d. every additional 2 oz. |

The number of letters and postcards and registered articles received and despatched in 1914 was 25,787,820; packets and newspapers, 12,419,223.

Area.

The State contains 26,215 square miles, the main island containing about 15½ million acres of land, and the smaller islands connected with it 1½ million acres; 6,351,121 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown, leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 8,581,974 (incl. lakes) acres (exclusive of 1,830,590 acres) which are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes, and 14,315 acres occupied by or reserved for State and Commonwealth Governments.

The adjacent islands are 50 in number, most of them being in Bass' Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group, including Flinders Island, Robins Island, King Island, and Bruni and Maria Island on the east coast.

Roads.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the State, and is maintained in fair order by the various municipalities. All the other main roads are under the control of municipalities, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local councillors, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the Treasury.

Railways.

There are now 747 miles of railway in the State, constructed mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. Of these 747 miles, 587½ belong to Government, and cost 4,979,399l., and 160½ miles to private companies. The gross earnings of the government lines were 366,735l. and working expenses 277,952l. in 1916-17.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; the upset price of second-class lands a sum not less than 10s. an acre; and of third-class land a minimum of 5s. per acre.

Under the Crown Lands Act, 1903 (3 Ed. VII., No. 39), any person of the full age of 18 years may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of first-class land not exceeding 200 acres, at 1l. an acre; 250 acres of
second-class land, at not less than 10s. per acre; and 400 acres of third-class land, at not less than 5s. per acre, with one-third added for credit, payable by annual instalments for 14 years. First-class lands must be resided upon for 5 years and improved to the value of 1l. per acre before grant can issue, or any person of the age of 18, who has not already selected or purchased under that Act, may take up land, not less than 15 acres, or more than 50 acres, and beyond a deposit of 2d. per acre, no further payment is to be made until the fourth year. But a grant cannot be issued for the land unless improved to the extent of 1l. for every acre and resided upon for 5 years, inclusive of the 3 years' free occupation. Second-class lands must be improved to a value of 5s. per acre, and third-class lands to a value of 2s. 6d. per acre, before grant can issue therefor.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, copper, tin, wolfram, lead, hides, skins, and leather, hops, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark.

The land in crop on 1st March, 1918, was 238,199 acres and 679,512 acres permanently artificially sown grasses. There were in the State 157,938 horned cattle, and 1,711,116 sheep.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, which are now being turned to good account. Gold, silver, copper, tin, coal, wolfram, and also other minerals are found throughout the island. The principal goldfields are at Beaconsfield, Lefroy, and Mathinna. At Beaconsfield the Tasmania Mine is the main producer. Since the reef was discovered in 1877 up to 31st December, 1915, Tasmania mine has produced 841,244 ozs. of gold, and the total amount paid in dividends is 772,672l. At Lefroy several mines are sinking, driving, etc. Silver is found on the west and east coasts. Total quantity of silver lead ore produced during the year ending 31st December, 1917, amounted to 9,575 tons, value 152,122l. Copper is also found, chiefly on the west coast, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company's mine being a large producer. This company has its own smelting and reduction plants, and for the year ending 31st December, 1917, produced 6,599 tons of blister copper, etc., value 847,754l. Tin is obtained in various parts of the island, the principal workings being at Mount Bischoff in the north-west and Braxholm and Mount Cameron in the north-east. The Mount Bischoff Company produced during the year ending 31st December, 1915, 479 tons, and paid in dividends 21,000l., making a total of 2,455,500l. distributed amongst the shareholders. 1917, total tin 2,637 tons, value 427,917l. Coal deposits exist more or less throughout the State, the principal mines being the Cornwall and Mount Nicholas in the north-eastern part. Output for the year ending 31st December, 1917, 63,412 tons, value 38,673l., at pit mouth. Osmiridium is found in the Wilson and Savage Rivers and their tributaries. During the year ending 31st December, 1917, 332,079 ozs. were obtained, value 4,898l.

Population.

The population in 1881 was 115,786, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females.

On 5th April, 1891, the population of Tasmania was 146,667, of whom 77,560 were males, and 69,107 females, being 5·60 persons to the square mile. On 31st March, 1901, the population was 172,475, of whom 89,624 were males, and 82,851 females. The death-rate of 1904 was 11·04 to the 1,000 of the population. The number of inhabited houses not including tents (1,013) was 31,046. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds (157). On 3rd April, 1911, population, 97,591 male and 93,620 female = 191,211 persons.

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing within the Registration boundary an estimated population (31st December, 1917) of 40,352.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the State, contains within the Registration boundary an estimated population (31st December, 1917) of 24,981.

Local Government.

The original of this form of Government was superseded in 1907 by the "Local Government Act" which divided the State into 49 municipalities, exclusive of Hobart and Launceston (founded in 1855). The former 48 municipalities are made up of wards, each receiving its own representatives. The Presidents of the Councils are called wardens, and are elected annually. The functions of the old town boards, road trusts, etc., are now merged into the new municipalities. Every elector of the municipality who is a resident or has a place of business therein is eligible to be elected as a councillor for so long as he continues to reside or to have a place of business in the municipality. Every male or female of the age of 21 years whose name is on the assessment roll as the owner or occupier of any property within the municipality, is entitled to vote in the election of councillors. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, Table Cape, Leven, and Strahan, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards.

The total revenue from these local Government bodies was (Municipalities 418,572l., Marine Boards 62,551l.) 481,123l. including Government grants to Municipalities 12,753l. The total expenditure including expenditure from Loans (Municipalities 570,977l., Marine Boards 101,363l.) 612,340l.

The outstanding local debt at end of 1916 was about 2,389,194l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are seven banks established in the State—viz., The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, Bank of New South Wales, and Commonwealth Bank, with, together, 54 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1916, amounted to 5,010,708l..
deposits £4,381,887. The note circulation on same date amounted to £11,710 (not including a Commonwealth note issue (£422,844) held by Banks).

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the State, established by Commonwealth Government in connection with the Post Office Department, total deposits at time of last balancing being £2,301,336.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1887 the board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a Director of Education, working under the Minister of Lands as Ministerial head. The system is free, national and compulsory, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 488 State schools in operation on 31st December, 1916, the number of scholars on the rolls 36,535, and the average attendance 23,296. In 1914, 25 State school scholarships (open to children under 13 years of age, from all schools) were in force.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and higher course of education amongst the youth of the State, the University of Tasmania was established in the year 1890, with power to grant scholarships and award degrees. In all eight scholarships are now awarded annually.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17), constituting "the Parliament of Tasmania," and various amending Acts. The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as nine members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council nor any person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers) nor contractor to Government. The qualification for a member is to be 30 years of age, and to be a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of £10, or leasehold of £30 annual value, or being a graduate of any University in the British Dominions, or Associate of Arts of Tasmania, or qualified legal or medical practitioner, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy, or retired officer of the Tasmanian Volunteer Force.

The House of Assembly consists of 30 members, elected for 5 electoral divisions. Any natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court, a person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers), nor a contractor to Government.

The duration of the Assembly is three years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to be a British subject, 21 years old, and resident for 12 months. The Franchise is extended to women. Voting by ballot is regulated by 1st Ed. VII., No. 57. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for about four months. Members, excepting Ministers and certain officers of Parliament, are paid £200. Members of the Commonwealth Parliament are disqualified for a seat in either House, and a Minister of the Crown under the Commonwealth cannot hold a post as Minister in Tasmania.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.
Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the River Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Fostert Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and on the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the State meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 31' S., longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,974,581 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.
Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places.
That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other States of the group, that it now contains 29 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The population on the 31st December, 1917, was 1,411,004, viz., 671,332 males and 739,622 females. These numbers give a proportion of 110·16 females to 100 males.

Immigration.

For several years prior to the war the Government pursued a policy of assisted immigration from the United Kingdom and other countries, and met with a considerable amount of success. Agriculturists, rural workers, and domestic servants were the classes of immigrants principally encouraged. Farm labourers from the United Kingdom were charged £10 and domestic servants £3 for third-class passages from London to Melbourne. Inexperienced farm labourers obtained passages at a fare of £12. Persons in Victoria nominated friends and relations in Great Britain by lodging a deposit of £8, the balance being payable in monthly instalments extending over six months. Wives and children were nominated under easier conditions.

The nomination system on a reduced scale has continued, but assisted immigration in other forms has been suspended during the war.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 577 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number 1,780. The postal, telegraph and telephone revenue was 1,491,153£., in 1916-17, and the expenditure 1,201,575£.

There are 8,999 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 29,446 miles of wire; also about 218,706 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1916-17 was 3,428,871. There are 50,636 telephones in use in the State, with 38,025 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1916-17 was 632,751£.

The railways in Victoria are all owned by the Government. The number of miles open for traffic on 30th June, 1918, was 4,157, and 115 miles were in course of construction. The receipts in 1917-18 totalled 6,593,873£., and the working expenses 4,603,905£. (including 129,160£. pensions and gratuities). The total cost of construction of lines opened to 30th June, 1918, was 56,694,141£. The interest and expenses on the debt incurred for construction amounted to 2,126,906£. during the year, and the revenue deficiency for the twelve months was 136,938£. The percentage of net receipts to capital cost was 3·0.

Climate.

From its geographical position Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other State of Australia. In regard to heat the weather is never severely oppressive, except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57·4°; the mean atmospheric pressure at 913 feet above the sea level was 29·93 inches; rain falls on the average upon 137 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25·56 inches.

Early History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonisation, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by Acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year an attempt was made to colonise the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be
considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the (as yet) unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements, but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when, on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is grazing and agriculture, 5,782,954 acres being under cultivation in 1917-18. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 2,690,216 acres, producing 37,737,552 bushels; oats, 293,214 acres, producing 6,141,287 bushels; barley, 84,931 acres, producing 1,970,650 bushels; potatoes, 66,966 acres, producing 182,195 tons; and hay, 748,808 acres, producing 949,545 tons. About 25,236 acres were devoted to the culture of the vine, producing 800,068 gallons of wine, 104,911 cwts. of raisins, and 53,799 cwts. of currants. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. The dairying industry has made rapid strides; in 1917 there were produced 64,405,711 lbs. of butter (of which 24,323,648 lbs. were exported overseas) and 5,285,003 lbs. of cheese. In March, 1918, there were in the State 514,061 horses, 1,371,049 cattle (including 534,388 milch cows), 14,760,913 sheep, and 323,159 pigs. The wool exported overseas in 1917-18 amounted to 87,681,189 lbs., valued at £6,820,006L. The amount of gold raised in 1917 was 217,092 ozs., making a total since 1851 of 74,804,167 ozs., valued at £298,651,651L. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the State will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of coal raised in 1917 was 505,364 tons, valued at £345,830L. The chief exports other than wool and gold (which comprise nearly half of the total), are grain and flour, butter, hides and skins, meats, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, coal, tea, and iron. Melbourne does 87 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Wodonga, Wahgunyah, Yarrawonga, Gooramadda, Koondrook, Tocumwal, Cobram, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1917 numbered 378, with a total tonnage of 166,605.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments employing four hands or upwards, except when machinery worked by steam or other power is employed, and except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on thereat; were this done, the manufactories of the State might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. The following is a statement of the number and nature of manufactories and hands employed therein during 1917-18:

| Nature of Industry | Number of Manufacturers | Hands Employed |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Tanning, fellmongering, &c. | 310 | 3,632 |
| Oil, soap, candle, &c. | 26 | 883 |
| Brick, stone, glass, &c. | 172 | 3,921 |
| Working in wood | 453 | 6,948 |
| Metal, machinery, &c. | 717 | 16,183 |
| Food, drink, tobacco, &c. | 649 | 17,100 |
| Woollen mills, clothing, boots, &c. | 1,488 | 40,312 |
| Printing, binding, paper, &c. | 462 | 9,169 |
| Organ, piano, &c. | ... | ... |
| Arms and explosives | 12 | 1,030 |
| Coachbuilding, bicycle, saddle, &c. | 561 | 4,654 |
| Shipbuilding, docks, &c. | 13 | 553 |
| Furniture, bedding, &c. | 274 | 2,867 |
| Drugs, chemicals, &c. | 103 | 2,207 |
| Surgical, &c., Instruments | 30 | 149 |
| Timepieces, jewellery, &c. | 92 | 1,028 |
| Heat, light and energy | 162 | 4,146 |
| Leatherware, &c. | 41 | 750 |
| Rubber goods, &c. | 62 | 2,609 |

Total | 5,627 | 118,241 |
The total number of all establishments is 5,627, of which 1,680 use steam or gas engines, the total horse power of which is 149,005. They employ 118,241 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is £25,460,282. The value of materials used was £42,133,636, and of articles produced or work done £67,066,715. The wages paid amounted to £12,502,601.

The estimated value of Victorian production in 1916-17 was as follows:

| Production Type                  | Value (£) |
|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Agricultural Production          | 15,956,524|
| Pastoral and Dairying Production | 22,617,384|
| Mining Production                | 1,536,387 |
| Forest                           | 936,660   |
| Miscellaneous Products           | 1,977,678 |

Total Primary Products: £43,024,633

Manufacturing—value added during process: £21,678,039

Total: £64,702,672

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other States. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. By the Water Act of 1905 all existing irrigation trusts, with the exception of the First Mildura Irrigation Trust, were abolished, and their works and duties transferred to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. In 1909 an Act was passed extending the authority of this latter body by giving it the general construction of works formerly intrusted to the Department of Water Supply and by imposing on the Commission all the duties formerly performed by the Water Supply Department. The capital expenditure on the irrigation works controlled by the Commissioners on the 30th June, 1917, amounted to £3,784,527. The Commission is empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation under their jurisdiction, the total area irrigated being 257,700 acres. The Mildura Irrigation Colony, lands, works, and approaches are controlled by the First Mildura Irrigation Trust. From time to time the Government has assisted the Mildura Trust until on the 30th June, 1917, the total amount advanced was £100,932, which, together with interest accumulated to that date represents its total indebtedness to the Government. The extent of watering done by this Trust represented 29,966 water acres in 1916-17.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, on the 31st December, 1917, had a population of 708,240. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (40,404), Bendigo (35,640), Geelong (34,037), Warrnambool (7,400), Castlemaine (7,372), Maryborough (4,900), Hamilton (4,700), Mildura (5,300), and Stawell (4,410).

Coloured Immigrants.

With a view of restricting the immigration of Asiatics and other coloured persons, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, which provides that any person, who, when asked to do so by a public officer, fails to write out from dictation and sign in the presence of the officer, a passage of fifty words in any prescribed language, is prohibited from landing in Australia. Certificates of exemption are granted in certain cases, and members of the military and naval forces, as well as the master and crew of any public vessel of any government, are excepted. There are not more than 7,184 coloured persons in the State.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering about 700 in all, throughout the State during the December quarter of 1917:—The Bank of Australasia; of New South Wales; of New Zealand; of Victoria; Colonial of Australasia; Commercial of Australia; English, Scottish and Australian; London of Australia; National of Australasia; Royal of Australia; the Union of Australia; Queensland National; North Queensland; Ballarat Banking Co.; Comptoir National D'Escompte de Paris; and The Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to £64,042,657, and the paid up capital to £27,006,166.

There are also 133 banks and branches, with 331 agencies at Post Offices of the Savings Bank. The number of depositors on the 30th June, 1918, was 813,031, and the amount on deposit was £30,765,927. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of about £2,000,000 is coined annually.

Education.

Education establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary and secondary education; registered schools for primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognised in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are four Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, Queen's, and Newman—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, the Methodist, and Roman Catholic Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1917 was 1,332. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1917, the total number of students who matriculated was 8,606, and 6,129 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, number 22; there are also 2 Agricultural Colleges and 1 School of Horticulture. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes and open to
women as well as men. The gross enrolment of pupils, excluding those at agricultural and horticultural colleges, was 8,336.

The system of primary public instruction, which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14, and State instruction is granted free of cost. In 1916-17 there were 2,202 State schools, with a total enrolment of 254,033 scholars, instructed by 6,781 teachers (including 506 temporary teachers). The average attendance was 161,034. In 1916-17 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was 1,054,568l. There is no local control over the schools.

The secondary schools are for the most part under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1916-17, there were 495 registered schools in Victoria, with 1,970 teachers, and an attendance of 56,193 scholars. Of these the Roman Catholic denomination had about one-fourth, about one-third of the teachers, and over half the scholars.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is the official head of the Legislature, and assents in the name of the Crown to Acts passed by the Parliament. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 34 members elected for 17 Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 65 members returned by 65 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 53).

The constitution of the two Houses and the qualification of Members and Electors have been amended on several occasions; and a Reform Act received the Royal Assent on 26th November, 1903. By this Act the number of Members of both Houses was reduced, the franchise for the Upper House broadened, and the property qualification for membership reduced, and several other reforms made. In 1907 an Act was assented to abolishing the separate representation of railways and public officers in the Parliament of the State—one of the provisions of the Reform Act of 1903. Officers in the service of the Government are, however, forbidden to take any part in the political affairs of the State otherwise than by recording a vote, and are prohibited from using any influence in respect to any matter affecting their remuneration or position in the public service.

The Adult Suffrage Act of 1908, assented to on 31st March, 1909, places women on an equality with men as electors for the State Legislature.

One of the two Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every three years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council, except in case of a deadlock between the two Houses. The property qualification of members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 50l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 15l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, matriculated students of the University of Melbourne, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated school-masters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered. By the Reform Act of 1903 the Council is now empowered to suggest alterations in these Bills.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of members of the Legislative Assembly, and universal suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. Plural voting was abolished by an Act passed in August, 1899, so far as the election of members of the Assembly is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is, under ordinary circumstances, three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856, and by an Act passed in October, 1900, provision is made for voting by post in certain cases.

All members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

An Act was passed in December, 1903, limiting the amount which may be expended by candidates for election expenses to 400l. and 150l., for the Council and the Assembly respectively. The purposes for which such expenditure may be incurred are also defined.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,234 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the State. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality, except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1917-18 there were 52 cities, towns, and boroughs and 139 shires. The number of ratepayers was 405,627; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 17,648,007l., representing a value in fee simple of 331,336,715l.; the total income in 1917 was 2,363,366l., and the expenditure was 2,339,011l.; whilst their loan indebtedness amounted to 6,030,343l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1917 was 318,917l., and its expenditure 403,490l., including capital expenditure 157,057l. The outstanding debt of the Trust at the end of 1917 amounted to 1,850,000l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works which body is also
empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1916-17 the Board's ordinary revenue was £620,541., and its expenditure £639,585., exclusive of £581,025. from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1917, amounting to £12,334,896., of which, however, £1,569,786. was raised in the first instance by the general Government, and is included in the Public Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works completed and in course of construction amounted to £7,424,163. up to the 30th June, 1917.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities and the Insurance Companies. In 1917 their revenue amounted to £104,069., their expenditure to £112,954., including £5,209. loan expenditure, and their debt to £200,000.

The Melbourne tramways were constructed by a Trust at a cost of £1,705,794., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. The debt was gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a public company, to which the lines were let for a period of 30 years. The lease expired on 1st July, 1916, when the balance of the outstanding debentures (£450,000.) was paid off. A Board consisting of five members, was nominated by the Government to take over and operate the undertaking from 1st July, 1916, to 31st October, 1918, or such earlier date as may be proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council. The Board is authorized to borrow up to £500,000. in order to finance the amount required to purchase such property of the Melbourne Tramway Company as may be necessary to carry on the undertaking. The amount of the compensation was fixed at £335,000. by His Honor Mr. Justice Cussen, an arbitrator appointed by the Governor-in-Council, but this award has been appealed against to the Privy Council.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 51' E.

Coast Line.

The Southern and Western coast line is, to a great extent, of a flat and sandy character, with comparatively few natural harbours or other indentations, until the Kimberley Division is reached, where its character changes, and it becomes bold and broken, and fringed with numerous islands. The total length of the coast line, not including minor features, is estimated to be approximately 4,350 miles.

Bays, Gulfs, &c.

The principal inlets, beginning from the north, are: Cambridge Gulf, Napier Broome Bay, Vansittart Bay, Admiralty Gulf, Montague Sound, York Sound, Brunswick Bay, Camden Sound, Collier Bay, King Sound, Beagle Bay, Roebuck Bay, Lagrange Bay, Port Walcott, Nickol Bay, Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, Champion Bay, Cockburn Sound, Koombana Bay, Geographe Bay, Flinders Bay, King George Sound, Bremer Bay, and Esperance Bay. With the exception of Princess Royal Harbour (the inner harbour of King George Sound), the principal anchorages used to the south of the 19th parallel of latitude are open roadsteads, which, as a rule, are only partially protected; but the holding grounds of these are fairly good, and accidents seldom happen to vessels properly found. Fine harbours have, however, been artificially provided at Fremantle, at the mouth of the Swan River, and at Bunbury, in Koombana Bay.

Capes.

The principal capes are: Capes Domett and Dussejour at the entrance of Cambridge Gulf; Cape Londonderry, which is the most northerly point of the State, with Cape Talbot, on the same peninsula; Cape Bougainville, lying between Admiralty Gulf and Vansittart Bay; Cape Voltaire, which is the western boundary of Admiralty Gulf; Cape Torrens, at the entrance to York Sound; Cape Leveque, the western boundary of King Sound; Cape Bruguiere, to the west of Nickol Bay; North-West Cape, which forms the western boundary of Exmouth Gulf; Cape Cuvier, at the northern extremity of Shark Bay; Cape Inscription, at the north end of Dirk Hartogs Island, so named because of an inscription plate placed there by Dirk Hartogs in 1616; Steep Point, situated on the southern entrance to Shark Bay, which is the most westerly point of the Continent; Cape Vlaming, being the Western extremity of Rottnest Island; Capes Naturaliste and Leeuwin at the south-western extremity of the Continent, and Point D'Entrecasteaux, West Cape Howe, Bald Head, Cape Riche, Hood Point, Cape le Grande, and Cape Arid on the Southern coast.

Tides.

As would naturally be expected with so extensive a coast line, the tides are very varied, little or no rise and fall being experienced on the South and South-Western coasts, whilst from Shark Bay northwards they increase rapidly, though not uniformly in range, attaining at King Sound a height of 46 feet.

Islands.

The islands which occur on the coast are, as a rule, small and unimportant, those best known being Garden and Rottnest Islands off Fremantle; the Houtman Abrolhos, near Champion Bay, on which guano is found; Dirk Hartogs and other islands in Shark Bay, used for pastoral purposes; Dampier Archipelago and the Montebello Group on the North-West coast; and off the Kimberley or extreme Northern coast, the Lapedes, on which are guano deposits, and the Buccaneer and Bonaparte Archipelagos, for the most part unexplored.

Rivers.

The principal rivers are: in the North, the Ord, with its tributaries, the Denham, Bow, Negri, and Panton; the Pentecost, with its tributary the Chamberlain; the Durack, Drysdale, Kim, Edward, Prince Regent, Charnley, Isdell, and the Fitzroy, with its tributaries the Margaret and Han Rivers and Christmas Creek. In the North-West, the De Grey, with its tributaries, the Oakover, Shaw, and Strelley; the Yule, the Fortescue, and the Ashburton, with its tributaries, the Henry and Hardy. Then, falling to the Western Coast, the Milinya, the Gascoyne, with its tributary, the Lyons; the Wooramel, the Murchison, with its tributary, the Sanford; the Greenough; the Swan, on which is situated the capital of the State, and which, inland, is called the Avon; the Murray, the Collie, and the Preston. And lastly, on the Southern Coast, the Blackwood, Donnelly, Warren, Frankland, Kalgan, Pallinup, Gairdner, Fitz Gerald and Phillips Rivers.

Mountains.

In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the King Leopold and the Princess May ranges, the highest point in the latter, Mount Hann, attaining 2,800 feet. In the North-West, between the Fortescue and Ashburton Rivers, the highest range is the Hamersley, with Mount Bruce (4,024 feet). The Darling range, which extends from Yatherod in the North to Point D'Entrecasteaux in the South, a distance of about 300 miles, attains its highest elevation, 1,910 feet above the level of the sea, at Mount Cooke in the Cockburn Sound District. In the South, the loftiest range is the Stirling range, the highest point of which is Bluff Knoll (3,640 feet). Between it and the coast, and parallel with both, extends the less elevated Porongorup range.

Lakes.

There are no lakes of any considerable importance in the State. Between the Darling range and the coast there are a few salt water lagoons, and many fresh water lakes, the majority of which are nothing more than swamps during the dry season, and none of them are of any economic importance. The so-called lakes in the interior of the State, which are frequently of very considerable area, are, except after the occasional heavy rains, merely immense salt marshes or clay-pans.

Contour of the Country.

That part of the State lying to the north of the 19th parallel of latitude may be described as
Further figures are very varied, little that part of the State lying to the north of the 19th parallel of latitude may be described as...
mountainous, consisting of alternating high and lower lying plateaux; the highest country here is principally of sandstone formation. The North-West Division and much of the Gascoyne Division also are distinctly mountainous, the ranges here being principally granite. The north and northeastern parts of the State contain a large area of good pastoral country. A large proportion of the South-Western and Southern sea-boards is of flat, sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation, and may be described as a vast forest, principally timbered with jarrah, white and red gums, and karri, most of which timbers are of great commercial value. From some points on the Western sea-board settlement has extended for about 500 miles inland; but, from very complete information furnished by explorers and prospectors, it is apparent that no considerable portion of the interior lying between the 19th and 31st parallels of latitude, and between the 121st and 129th meridians of longitude is suitable for any class of settlement except in connection with the development of the mineral resources. This area may be described as a great tableland, with an altitude of from one to two thousand feet above sea level, the surface of which consists largely of sand dunes, though in many parts of it there are large areas of clayey soils. Between the 30th parallel of latitude and the Great Australian Bight, much of the country is of limestone formation, and here there are immense areas of grass land, which only await the discovery of subterranean water to make them amongst the most productive areas of the State.

Early History.

The first authentic record of European explorers visiting any portion of Western Australia is contained in the words cut into the tin plate, now in the State Museum at Amsterdam, which was nailed on the 25th October, 1616, by Dirk Hartogs, the commander of the Dutch vessel Eendracht, to a post erected on Point Inscription on what is now called Dirk Hartogs Island. Other vessels successively visited, or were driven by stress of weather on the West coast of the Continent, notably the Leeuwin in 1622, the Batavia (Capt. Pelsart) in 1628, the Limmen (Capt. Tasman) in 1644, and the Geelvink (Capt. de Vlaming) in 1696. The first Englishman, however, to land on these coasts was William Dampier, who, in 1688, in the Cygnet, landed at King Sound. French navigators followed during the next century and after, viz., de St. Alouarn, in Le Gros Ventre, in 1772, d'Entrecasteaux, in La Recherche, in 1792, Baudin, in the Geographie, in 1801, de Freycinet, in the Uranie, in 1818, and De Bougainville, with the vessels Thétis and Esperance, in 1825. In 1791, Vancouver, in the Discovery, took formal possession of the country about King George Sound. In 1801, Matthew Flinders, in the Investigator, explored the Southern coast of the Continent, which, at his suggestion, subsequently received the name of Australia; whilst from 1818 to 1822 Philip Parker King, first in the Mermaid and afterwards in the Bathurst, explored and carefully charted its Northern Coasts.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent 20 convicts and a detachment of soldiers to King George Sound and formed a settlement then called Fredericks Town. In 1827 Captain James (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, in H.M.S. Success, surveyed the coast from King George Sound to the Swan River, and in May, 1829, Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. Challenger, took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain Stirling founded the Swan River Settlement, now the Commonwealth State of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success, until, in 1850, the State was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants' petition that it might be made a penal settlement was acceded to. Between 1850 and 1868, when transportation ceased, 9,718 convicts were sent out. The Imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

In 1870 the constitution, which was what is called "Representative," was established by Act 33 Vict. No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council, consisting then of three official members of the Executive Council, three unofficial nominees of the Governor, and 12 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The Legislature consists of two Houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 30 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 50 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.

Provinces.—The State is divided into 10 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Any man who is (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the State for at least 2 years; (3) a natural-born subject of His Majesty or naturalised for 5 years, and a resident in the State during that period.

Qualification of Elector.—"The Constitution Act Amendment Act, 1899," has extended the right to vote equally to both sexes. The qualifications of a voter are laid down in the Act, which extends the franchise to every person, not under 21 years of age, and not otherwise disqualified, who (1) is a subject of the King, either natural-born or having been naturalised for at least 12 months; (2) has resided in the State for 6 months; and (3) in the province for which enrolment is claimed has freehold property of the clear value of £50, or is a householder or a ratepayer in respect of property of the clear annual value of £17, or a leaseholder to the clear annual value of £17, or a Crown leaseholder paying a rental of £10 per annum.

Legislative Assembly.

Districts.—There are 50 electoral districts for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by one member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 3 years.
Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the State for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the King, or shall have been naturalised for 5 years, and shall have resided in the State for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Subject to certain qualifications every person not under twenty-one years of age, who—

(a) is a natural born or naturalised subject of His Majesty; and

(b) has resided in Western Australia or six months continuously; and

(c) has resided in the district for which he claims to be enrolled for a continuous period of one month immediately preceding the date of his claim,

is entitled to be enrolled as an elector, and when enrolled, and so long as he continues to reside in the district for which he is enrolled, to vote at the election of a member of the Legislative Assembly for that district. No person can be a registered voter in more than one electorate.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible Ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Premier and Minister for Lands and Agriculture; the Colonial Secretary and Minister for Education; the Minister for Works and Trading Concerns, and Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage; the Attorney-General and Minister for Industries, and Woods and Forests; the Colonial Treasurer; the Minister for Mines and Railways; and three Ministers without portfolio.

Western Australia is represented in the Federal Senate of Australia by six members, and in the House of Representatives by five members.

Local Government.

Under the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1906," municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding 1s. 6d. in the £ per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property. All license fees, tolls, dues, &c., under the Municipal Corporations Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. Under the "Roads Act, 1911," Boards are allowed to levy a general rate as follows:—Upon the unimproved rateable value of land not less than 1d. or exceeding 3d. in the £, and upon the annual value not less than 9d. or exceeding 2s. in the £. Municipalities and Road Boards have power to borrow money for the construction of roads and other purposes. Both may levy "loan rates" for interest and Sinking Fund in connection with loans; for the former the rate must not exceed 1s. 6d. in the £, but for the latter no maximum has been fixed. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Boulder, Broome, Bunbury, Busselton, Carnarvon, Claremont, Collie, Coolgardie, Cottesloe, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Guildford, Kalgoorlie, Midland Junction, Mt. Magnet, Narrogin, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, Greater Perth, South Perth, Subiaco, Southern Cross, Wagin, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000 consist of a mayor and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and 12 councillors—the mayor being elected annually by the ratepayers, by whom also the councillors are elected for a term of three years. Local road boards and municipal councils have power under Acts of Parliament to issue licenses to carts, carriages, etc., within their respective districts and municipalities.

30,228£ was granted for the financial year 1916-17 to District Road Boards (of which there were, on the 30th June, 1918, 116) and Municipal Councils (27) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the State, in addition to the moneys expended by the Public Works Department for the same purpose. Under the "Water Boards Act, 1904," Boards may levy a rate not exceeding 2s. 6d. in the £ on the annual rateable value of land, and have power to borrow money for the construction of works, etc. Under the Health Act, 1911, the Local Boards of Health of municipalities and other localities to which the provisions of the Act apply are required to make and levy such annual health rate as may be required for the purposes of that Act.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the State at the 30th June, 1918, was estimated to be 311,121, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese at the 1911 census was 1,812, of whom 1,775 were males and only 37 females. In addition to these there were 33 male and 27 female half-caste Chinese.

The chief town is Perth, (estimated population 130,000 including Fremantle, and the various suburbs within the Metropolitan Area). The capital is picturesquely situated on the right bank of the Swan River estuary. The King's Park (approximately 1,000 acres), on a hill overlooking the city and the wide estuarine reaches of the river, is one of unique natural beauty. The chief ports are:—Fremantle (25,000), Albany (4,200), Bunbury (3,440), Geraldton (3,800), and Broome, with a considerable floating population of pearlers, mostly Asiatics. The chief centre of the agricultural districts is Northam (3,500), and of the goldfields areas Kalgoorlie (15,700, including Boulder).

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the State, 21,567,713 acres only were, on the 30th June, 1918, alienated or in process of alienation, while 208,049,010 acres were leased, viz., 204,820,869 for pastoral, and the balance for other purposes. No less than 394,972,077 acres were still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 4,350 miles, not including minor features, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. The south-west corner of the State, however, where the older settlements are situated, has now proved itself destined to become one of the world's greatest wheat producing areas, and agriculture here is progressing at an almost phenomenal rate, the wheat harvest having increased from 2,460,823 bushels in 1909, to 18,236,355 bushels in 1916. This amount, owing to a poor harvest, combined with the
effects of the war, fell to 9,303,787 bushels in 1918. As a rule, a sufficient rainfall can be relied upon. In the neighbourhood of and Eastward from, Toodyay, Northam, York, Beverley, Pingelly, Wagin, Katanning, and the other centres of the southern part of the State, the areas under farms and cultivation are constantly and rapidly extending. The total area of land under cultivation on 28th February, 1918, was 7,587,820 acres, viz., under crop 1,679,772 acres, under permanent artificially sown grasses 11,769 acres, new ground cleared during the season and prepared for next season's crops 115,862 acres, land in fallow 662,543 acres, area of other cleared land previously cropped, now used for grazing or lying idle 1,706,230 acres, ring-barked or partially cleared land 3,411,653 acres; beyond this, the travellers way still lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialised in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian States, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 6,384,191) are depastured in all parts of the State. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in the year ended 30th June, 1918, was 10,632,022 lbs., valued at £33,819. A considerable quantity of wine is made. Since 1907, wheat growing has become a specially important industry. In that year, the export of wheat was valued at £96,675., that of flour at £34,565. In 1910 the figures were respectively £406,326., and £25,427., in 1911, £386,922., and £54,565., in 1912, £100,148., and £121,730., in 1913, £763,798., and £239,840., whilst for the first six months of 1914 the values amounted to £1,343,856., and £168,011.; for the year ended 30th June, 1915, to £107, and £26,630.; and for the year ended 30th June, 1916, to £1,023,362., and £214,166. The season 1914-15 was an exceptionally dry one, and, in addition, war conditions had an influence on the export. Nevertheless, in 1917 wheat was exported to the value of £1,619,630., and flour to the value of £424,361. The figures for 1918 being respectively £437,709., and £693,577. Another progressive industry is fruit-growing, especially apples, which latter are already exported in considerable quantities. The export of fruit rose in value from £925. in 1907 to £32,274., in 1913, to £68,280., during the first six months of 1914, to £46,417., during the year ended 30th June, 1915, and to £22,215., during the year ended 30th June, 1916, whilst the figures for the next two years were £82,014., and £35,689.

The principal forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, harbour works, etc. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government and also by the Government. The export of timber for the six months ended 30th June, 1914 was valued at £502,153. The figures for the four subsequent years, 1914-15 and 1915-16, were respectively £808,392., £442,014., £310,983., and £274,280. Sandal-wood is still abundant, and was exported to Asiatic countries to the value of £61,381. during 1915-16, and during the next two years £72,669., and £81,834.

At Broome and on the north-west coast generally, a fleet of some 300 schooners, cutters, and luggers are employed on the pearling banks, giving occupation to 131 white, 18 aboriginal, and 2,200 Asiatic pearlers. The export of pearls and shell amounted to £174,050., in 1917-18.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but of late years little work has been done in them. Copper, however, has since been found also in several other districts, notably those of Mt. Morgans, Phillips River, and West Pilbara.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until three decades since. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners to Western Australia, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

After the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining became for the time being the principal industry of the State, and so rapidly did the annual output of gold increase for a number of years, that it placed Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing States of Australasia.

There are now 18 goldfields in existence—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Gascoyne, Murchison, East Murchison, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, and Phillipe River, and a large population is continually employed in searching for and extracting precious metals.

Much machinery is in operation, and the fields have for several years been well established, with a steady annual output and a settled population. The value of gold produced up to the end of September, 1918, was £136,729,481. During 1917 the value of the gold production was £4,121,645.

There is also good coal in the south-west corner of the State, and evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district. On the Collie Coalfield, situated in the Wellington district, six companies are successfully working coal-leases. The output in 1917-18 was 331,378 tons.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered at Greenbushes, on the Blackwood river, resulting in the opening up of a rich tinfield. Considerable quantities of tin have also been raised at Marble Bar.

Silver is found, mostly together with other minerals, and extracted in conjunction with gold. Other minerals found are antimony, gadolinite, bismuth, tantalite, lead, asbestos, mica, wolfram and scheelite, zinc, ironstone, magnesite, limestone, molybdenite and pyritic ore.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the State: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia,
Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and the Royal Bank of Australia, Limited, which commenced business in 1915.

The deposits in the banks during the year ended 31st December, 1917, averaged 8,589,134l.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia commenced business in Western Australia on 20th January, 1913. The average deposits for the year 1917 included above amounted to 2,559,934l., including Commonwealth Savings Bank Deposits.

The Government savings bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1918, amounted to 3,606,153l., exclusive of amounts deposited in the School Savings Bank, viz., 22,511l.

Branches of the Commonwealth Savings Bank were opened in this State at the beginning of 1913, and the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1918, amounted to 1,160,924l.

A branch of the Royal Mint exists in Perth. The number of sovereigns minted during the year ended 30th June, 1918, was 3,977,106l. The total value of sovereigns and half-sovereigns minted since the foundation in June, 1899, was, on 30th June, 1918, 80,591,531l.

Education.

Government Primary Schools exist in all parts of the State, and are under the control of the Minister for Education. The whole cost of the schools is borne by the Government, and the staffs are appointed by the Education Department.

Attendance at school of all children between the ages of six and fourteen is compulsory, and only in cases of poverty or sickness on the part of the parents is exemption granted to children between the ages of twelve and fourteen. General religious teaching, exclusive of dogmatic or polemic theology, is included in the course of instruction given, whilst representatives of various denominations are admitted to give instruction during school hours to their followers.

Boys over twelve and under fourteen years of age are trained as Junior Cadets in all schools.

The number of Government Primary Schools open in 1917 was 646. The average enrolment for the year was 47,717, and the average attendance 41,034.

Where an average attendance of ten children cannot be maintained, the Department pays an annual grant (from 7l. to 8l. 10s.) for each child if the parents secure a suitable teacher.

Children who complete satisfactorily the primary course may obtain the Department's "Qualifying Certificate." They may then pass to a High School for a four years' Secondary Course, or to the upper classes of a Central School for a two years' course.

Three courses—Commercial, Industrial, and Domestic—are provided in the upper classes of the Central Schools.

The four years' course in the Government High Schools is divided into two sections of two years each. The work of the lower section is, with very small exceptions, common to all students. In the upper section there is a considerable amount of specialisation.

Manual training in woodwork is included in the course of all the larger Primary Schools. In the Central Schools and High Schools metalwork is also taken.

Domestic work—Cookery, Laundry and Housewifery—is included in the course of all the larger Primary Schools, and also in the course of the Central Schools and High Schools.

Continuation Classes are provided for those who leave school without passing through the upper classes of the Central Schools or the High Schools. The courses of these classes are designed to lead to higher work in the Technical Schools.

Technical Schools are established in the principal centres. They include advanced work in Science, Trades Classes, Commercial Classes, Art Classes, Domestic Classes, etc. There is also a large School of Mines at Kalgoorlie.

The University in Perth provides courses for Degrees in Arts, Science (including Agriculture), and Engineering.

Scholarships are provided by the Government to enable pupils from the Primary Schools to pass to the Secondary Schools. Further scholarships are provided to be held at the Technical Schools, and ten scholarships are offered each year for the University.

Education is free throughout from the Kindergarten to the University. Fees at the Government High School were abolished at the beginning of 1913, when the University opened without fees. Fees in the Technical Schools were abolished at the beginning of 1914.

Private Schools are open to Government inspection, and must be declared efficient. The Government Secondary School Scholarships may be held at non-Government Secondary Schools.

The total Government expenditure upon education during 1916-17 (apart from the University and the cost of buildings) was 334,132l. The amount expended on buildings for the Education Department was 21,706l. There were also grants of 15,011l. to the University. Other Educational expenditure amounted to 5,671l. The aggregate expenditure upon Education was therefore 376,520l. The mean population of the State for the financial year was 310,684l.

Means of Communication.

The State possesses at present eight lines of Government railways as shown below. The first four form the Southern System, which is connected with the Northern System by No. 5. The Midland Railway Company's (Private) line of 277 miles, constructed on the land grant system, and running from Midland Junction to Walkaway, also affords a connection between the Southern and Northern Systems.

The Hopetoun to Ravensthorpe and Port Hedland to Marble Bar Railways are not geographically connected with the remainder of the system.

Total... ... ... 3,491

These lines have numerous sidings, totalling in all 357 miles.

The Government have taken over from the 1st July, 1913, the Perth Electric Tramways.

There are also several other private lines, mostly constructed by timber companies in the south of the State, in extent about 695 miles.

As long contemplated by the Commonwealth Government, a Transcontinental Railway (4ft. 8½in. gauge) from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, has now been constructed, thus uniting the railway systems of Western and South Australia, a distance of 1,052 miles.

The receipts of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1918, were £1,816,388, and the working expenses £1,451,334. The total cost of construction has been £17,760,566.

Of electric telegraph on the 30th June, 1918, there were 15,754 miles of wire. During 1917 the revenue received by the telegraph branch was £6,985; telephone receipts amounted to £6,033, and postal and other revenue of the post and telegraph department to £97,253; cost of post and telegraph, £486,698. (incl. new works).

There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay, also with South Africa by Coos Island. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the State, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 32,234 miles of telephone wire in the State; further 7,402 miles of Government, and 638 miles of private railway telephone wire, and 1,114 miles of Government railway telegraph wire.

A high-power wireless station has been erected at Applecross, between Perth and Fremantle, by the Commonwealth Government. Stations of lower power have been erected at Esperance, Geraldton, Roebourne, Broome and Wyndham.

The steamers of the P. and O. and Orient Companies carry mails to and from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the other Australian States, which are further supplemented by those of the Messageries Maritimes, whilst the White Star line conveys those from and to South Africa. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australian States, New Zealand, and Polynesia, by the various inter-State steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 28 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

| Places | Newspapers | Letters |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Within the British Empire | ½d. per 10 ozs. | ¼d. per ½-oz. |
| New Hebrides, Banks and Torres Islands | 1d. | 1d. |
| Other Countries of Postal Union | 2½d. | 2½d. |

The federal postal statistics for the year ended 30th June, 1917, give the following as the number (each counted once) of letters, postcards, etc., received and despatched in this State:

| English, Inter-State, and Foreign. |
|-----------------------------------|
| Letters, Post Cards and Letter Cards | 24,148,298 |
| Newspapers | 4,340,579 |
| Packets | 1,413,847 |
| Parcels | 197,705 |
| Registered Articles | 353,507 |

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 419 vessels and a tonnage of 39,434 on 31st December, 1917. Harbour works have been constructed, and the Royal Mail steamers, as also those of the Messageries Maritimes, make Fremantle their port of call.

Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. The natives were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-rivers, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are occasionally employed as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule, they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when

* If printed within the Commonwealth.
† If printed outside the Commonwealth.
‡ Between 8 ozs. and 10 ozs., 2½d., and for every additional 2 ozs., ¼d.
§ The following regulation has recently been proclaimed: "On and after 28th October, 1914, a half-penny additional postage has to be affixed on all articles excepting Parcel Post articles and Soldiers' letters."

The number of full-blooded aborigines and half-castes, so far as enumerated, at the date of the 1911 census was 6,369, and 1,475 respectively. These include only those who were in the employ of whites at date of the census, or were living in a civilised or semi-civilised condition in the vicinity of settlements of whites at that date.
they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned the successful mission conducted at New Norcia (founded by the late Right Reverend Bishop Salvado), which was commenced in the year 1846. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia was passed by the Houses of Legislature in 1897, but has since been repealed by the "Aborigines Act" of 1905 (amended, 1911). In accordance with the clauses of the latter the welfare of the natives is now entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a Minister of the Crown, and provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of £10,000, to be used by this sub-department. In addition to this sum, a further amount of £9,422, was spent on behalf of the aborigines during the year ending 30th June, 1918.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate during 1917 was 8·97 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33·53 inches (for 42 years), and the mean temperature is 64°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY.

Area and Population.

Upon the extension of New South Wales westward to the 129th meridian in 1827, the Northern Territory was comprised within that colony (see Commonwealth Official Year Book No. 4, page 16), and in 1863 was annexed by Royal Letters Patent to the province of South Australia. With the adjacent islands, it was transferred to the Commonwealth on 1st January, 1911.

Area and Boundaries.

The total area of this Territory is 523,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres. Its length from north to south is about 900 miles, while its breadth from east to west is 560 miles. Its eastern boundary, dividing it from Queensland, is the 138th meridian of east longitude; and its western boundary, separating it from Western Australia, the 129th meridian. Its southern boundary is the 26th parallel of south latitude, dividing it from South Australia. The northern boundary is the coast line of those parts of the Indian Ocean known as the Timor and Arafura Seas. Near the mouth of the Wentworth River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Coast line is met by the eastern boundary; at Cape Domett, near Cambridge Gulf, the western boundary cuts the northern coast line. The length of coast line is about 1040 miles, or 503 square miles of area to one mile of coast line; an exact survey has, however, not yet been made.

Population.

(i.) Character. In 1881 there were 670 Europeans in the Territory, and at the end of 1914 the number was estimated at 2,452. The Chinese population, at its maximum during the years of railway construction, 1887 and 1888, has gradually dwindled, the estimate for 1914 being 1,033. Japanese, first recorded in 1884, increased up to the year 1898, falling again after five years. The highest recorded population, excluding aborigines, was 7,533 in 1888; the estimate for 1914 was 3,720. The year 1911 was the first in which the population was dominated by the European race. A thirty years table of population, distinguishing races, will be found on page 1156 of the Commonwealth Official Year Book, No. 5. Subsequent to the census of 1911, a revision of the estimates, back to 1901, was made. The results are shown in the following table:

| Year ended 31st December | Male | Female | Total |
|--------------------------|------|--------|-------|
| 1908                     | 2,963| 609    | 3,572 |
| 1909                     | 2,927| 576    | 3,503 |
| 1910                     | 2,738| 563    | 3,301 |
| 1911                     | 2,662| 586    | 3,248 |

Aborigines.

The interior of the Territory is the most thickly populated by the natives, but it is believed that they are quickly dying out. In these
regions, remote from contact with other races, the native has maintained his primitive simplicity, and furnished an interesting subject of study to the anthropologist and the ethnologist. At the census of 1911, full-blooded aboriginals in the employ of whites, and those who were living in a civilised or a semi-civilised condition in the vicinity of European settlements, were enumerated—the males being 743, females 480; total 1223. Estimates of the total black population of the Territory vary from 20,000 to 50,000.

Historical.

Exploration and Colonisation.

(i.) Coastal Surveys. The coast was surveyed by King in 1817, and by Wickham and Stokes in 1838 and 1839. Port Darwin, the site of Darwin, the present capital, was discovered in the latter year.

(ii.) Exploration of Interior. Leichhardt traversed a great deal of the country in 1844-5, journeying from Queensland to Port Essington. Gregory started from Point Pearce in 1855, and reached Brisbane. Minor explorations were also successfully undertaken.

(iii.) Crossing the Continent. In 1861, Stuart began his transcontinental journey from Adelaide, and reached the north coast in July, 1862. His track has become the main route, and along it the telegraph line is constructed.

(iv.) Demarcation of Boundaries. Upon the extension westwards of New South Wales, in 1827, the Territory was included in that colony, and remained so until 1863, when it was added to South Australia, which in 1836 had been created a separate province.

(v.) The Military Settlement. A military post was formed on Melville Island in 1825. This was transferred in 1827 to Raffles Bay, and a few years later to Port Essington. Little public attention was given to the station, and no attempt at colonisation was made. It was abandoned in 1849.

Control by South Australia.

(i.) Transfer. As a result of representations to the Imperial Government by South Australia, the Territory was incorporated with that State in 1863, and administered through a Government Resident located at Port Darwin up to 31st December, 1910. Early attempts at settlement failed. Ultimately, Port Darwin was chosen for the site of the capital, and Palmerston (now officially named Darwin) founded.

(ii.) Land Legislation. The South Australian Government's land legislation was framed to attract settlers, viz., low rents with easy entry and unencumbered holding over long periods; or grant of fee simple at low price. Special arrangements were made to foster tropical agriculture, including the establishment of botanic gardens at Port Darwin, for observation and experiment. Large "runs" were established on the northern well grassed and watered pastures.

(iii.) Mining. The survey and construction of the overland telegraph revealed the auriferous nature of the country, and gold and other minerals were discovered in various localities. The Government regulated the area of claims and the conditions upon which they were held.

(iv.) Cessation of Supervision by South Australia. Progress was not as marked as was desired, the Territory being thought capable of more rapid development. Accordingly the Federal and State Governments agreed upon a surrender by the latter as from 1st January, 1911, since which date the Territory has been a dependency of the Commonwealth.

Transfer to Commonwealth.

(i.) The Agreement. An agreement of transfer, afterwards ratified by the representative Parliaments, was made between the two Governments. In accordance with a proclamation issued in the terms of the Commonwealth Acceptance Act (No. 20 of 1910), the transfer was effected on 1st January, 1911.

(ii.) The Northern Territory Acceptance Act. By the Commonwealth Act, the agreement is ratified and approved, the Territory is accepted together with the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway; laws and courts of justice remain in operation, powers and functions of magistrates and officials remain vested; estates and interests continue upon the same terms; trade with Australian States is declared free. The Commonwealth assumes responsibility for the State loans in respect of the Territory; paying the interest yearly to the State, providing a sinking fund to pay off the loans at maturity, and paying off the deficit in respect of the Territory. It also purchases the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, and agrees to complete the construction of the trans-continental railway from Port Darwin to Port Augusta.

(iii.) The South Australian Surrender Act.—The State Act approves and ratifies the agreement surrendering the Territory.

(iv.) The Northern Territory (Administration) Act, 1910.—The Act provides for Government authorising the appointment of an administrator and officials. South Australian laws are declared to continue in force as laws of the Territory and certain Commonwealth Acts to apply. Power is given to the Governor-General to make Ordinances having the force of law.

(v.) Administration.—A Resident Administrator, vested with supreme authority in internal affairs, was appointed in the Department of the Minister for External Affairs in February, 1912. Many other important administrative offices have also been filled.

(vi.) Legislation.—The main provisions of the Ordinances passed are as follows:—The powers and duties of the Administrator vested in the appointee, include custody of the public seal, appointment and suspension of officials, and execution of leases of Crown lands. He is assisted by a council of advice, not exceeding six, and meeting monthly. A Supreme Court with original and appellate jurisdiction is instituted, the method of appointment of the Judge is prescribed, and provision is made for trial by jury, and for the registration and summoning of jurors. A Sheriff, a Registrar-General, and a Health Officer are provided for, also the registration of births, marriages and deaths, and of deeds and documents. District Councils are authorised to assess land values and levy rates on unimproved value. Custody and control of aborigines with extensive powers of supervision are vested in the Chief Protector. Birds protected—some during the year, and some during part of the year, are scheduled. Crown lands are classified, and their mode of acquisition, entry and holding defined. Shop assistants are to have a weekly half holiday, and the establishments must be closed at a certain time. Mining is encouraged by the provision of rewards for the invention of new processes, and
the discovery of valuable deposits and of new mineral fields; subsidization of the industry and the issue of prospecting licences are also provided for. Licences to search for mineral oil, and leases of land for the working of the industry are available. A Board is constituted for the purpose of making advances to settlers, who intend to improve and stock their holdings, to purchase farm implements, plant, etc., or to pay off mortgages, the rate of interest and terms of repayment being set out.

Physiography.

Tropical Nature of the Country.—The territory is within the torrid zone, with the exception of a strip 2½ degrees wide, which lies south of the Tropic of Capricorn.

Contour and Physical Characteristics.—The low flat coast line seldom reaches a height of 100 feet. Sandy beaches and mud flats, thickly fringed with mangroves, prevail. Sandstone, marl, and ironstone form the occasional cliffy headlands. The sea frontage of more than 1000 miles is indented by bays and inlets and intersected by numerous rivers, many of which are navigable for considerable distances from their estuaries.

Inland, the country is generally destitute of conspicuous landmarks. From the coast there is a general rise southwards to the vicinity of the 17th or 18th parallel of south latitude, where the higher lands form the watershed between the rivers that flow northwards to the sea, and those that form the scanty supply of the interior systems. Towards the centre of the continent the land over a wide area is of considerable elevation, and there are several mountain ranges, generally with an east and west trend.

Climate.

On the northern coast, as in the tropics generally, there are two main climatic divisions—the wet season, November to April, and the dry season, May to October. The changes of season are uniform and regular. Immediately after the vernal equinox, the wet season is heralded by the cessation of the east-south-easterly monsoon, which gives place to calm and light variable winds. Intensely hot weather prevails for a few days, thunder-clouds gathering and increasing daily until they burst in heavy thunderstorms accompanied by hurricanes, and increasing in strength and frequency until the end of November, when they become of almost daily occurrence, about an inch of rain falling during each storm. During December the north-west monsoon sets in gradually, with rain nearly every day, and increasing in force until about the end of January. At this period of the year the wet season penetrates into the heart of the continent. This monsoon dies away at the autumnal equinox, and is succeeded by light and variable winds till the end of April, when the dry season commences with the setting in of the south-east monsoon. Nearly the whole of the rainfall occurs in the summer months.

Fauna and Flora.

Native Animals.—The ordinary types of Australian fauna inhabit the territory. As elsewhere on the continent, the higher Theria are rare. There are many genera of marsupials, and individuals are numerous. The birds also are typically Australian, with brilliant plumage, and not generally gifted with song. Crocodiles and fresh-water tortoises frequent the northern rivers. There are some species of snakes, mostly non-venomous, the most numerous being the harmless python. Frogs abound, the water-holding frog being common in Central Australia. The rivers contain many varieties of freshwater fish. The molluscan fauna of the coast are mostly carnivorous, the vegetable feeders being very poorly represented, probably on account of the dearth of seaweed. Land and freshwater shellfish are not abundant. Among insects, many beautiful butterflies thrive in the warm damp atmosphere. Beetles also are strongly represented. The white ant is a pest, very few timbers being immune from its ravages. Anthills in the Territory sometimes attain a height of twenty-five feet and a diameter of ten feet. Another destructive insect, particularly active and mischievous inland, is the borer. Mosquitoes and sandflies are very troublesome, particularly from January to April. There are not many crustaceans.

Imported Stock.—Buffalo thrive in the Territory. At Port Essington they are numerous, and there are large herds on Melville Island. Timor ponies have also been introduced. Imported sheep and horned cattle thrive on the stations.

Protection of Fauna.—Ruthless destruction of native birds is prohibited. An Ordinance (No. 1 of 1912) gives the Administrator power to declare that any bird is protected; and provides that permits to export protected birds, or the skins or eggs of such birds, will only be issued subject to such conditions as the Administrator directs.

Flora.—The vegetation is tropical, many of the forms belonging to the Malayan and Oceanic regions. The timber trees are not of great commercial value, but in the coastal regions tropical vegetation grows luxuriantly to the water's edge. The indented arms of the coast are thickly fringed with the mangrove. On the ranges pines, fig trees, and orange trees flourish. The Roper River drains extensive forest lands. Leichhardt pines and palms form the vegetation of the tableland, which stretches across the Territory about the 14th degree of south latitude. On the higher steppes there are a few varieties of eucalyptus, and many fibre plants are also indigenous. On the wide expanses of plain country of the interior, there is little vegetation, tree growth being very scanty, consisting chiefly of stunted eucalypts, such as the gimlet gum, black box, and desert sheoak. In the north-western districts there is an almost entire absence of lichens and mosses, though ferns are plentiful in the vicinity of the Victoria River. The following orders are well represented:—Euphorbiaceae, Compositae, Convolvulaceae, Rubiaceae, Goodeniaceae, Leguminosae, Urticaceae.

Production.

There is no great home consumption of the articles produced in the Territory, the greater part being exported overseas and to the States of the Commonwealth.

Stock.—The spacious, well-grassed "runs" of the Territory are suitable for horse and cattle breeding. It is anticipated that the cattle trade with the East will develop. Large numbers are overlanded to neighbouring States, which also take considerable quantities of horse hides. The estimated number of stock on 31st December, 1916, was:—

Live Stock, Northern Territory, 31st December, 1916.—Horses, 21,674; cattle, 420,362; sheep, 47,520; pigs, 500; goats, 7,514.
Dairying as an industry is non-existent. The abundant indigenous herbage is, however, well suited for stock, and the making of hay and ensilage would ensure the development of the industry.

Mining.—Considerable quantities of the precious and commercial metals are mined. The discovery of gold and tin in various localities, and the measure of success that has attended their working, indicate scope for development. Both alluvial and reef gold are found, and there are several batteries and cyanide plants. The following table shews the total mineral production for 11 years.

(ii.) Mining Accidents, 1900 to 1916.—In 1911 five mining accidents were recorded, four resulting in death. There were no serious accidents in 1910, 1912 and 1913. In each of the years 1914, 1915 and 1916 there was one death from accident. During the nine years preceding (1901–1909), nine fatal accidents and seven cases of serious injury were recorded, the majority of the victims being Chinese.

Pearl Shell.

In 1884 mother-of-pearl shell was discovered in the harbour of Port Darwin. Difficulty in working, principally through heavy tides and muddy water, retarded the development of the industry for many years. Latterly, however, the opening up of new patches has led to a revival. In 1915, twenty-five boats were engaged, valued, with their equipment, at about £6,250; 150 men were employed. Forty-two tons of pearl shell were obtained, valued at £6,135; Béche-de-mer valued at £160 was also raised and 100 lbs. of tortoiseshell, valued at £50.

Commerce and Shipping.

Trade.—The following table shews the total trade of the Territory for ten years from 1901 to 1910:

No record is now kept of the direction of trade between the Commonwealth States and Territories. It is, therefore, impossible to give the total imports and exports of the Northern Territory for years later than 1910.

**Shipping.**—The Territory's overseas commerce is carried in British and Japanese bottoms. One of the British lines maintains a monthly service, other lines are irregular. Coastal shipping is chiefly in Australian vessels. There is a small local trade, a steamship running between Port Darwin, Port McArthur, Daly River, Victoria River, and Wyndham (Western Australia).

Internal Communication.

Railways.—Under the agreement ratified by the Act the Commonwealth is to construct the Northern Territory portion of the transcontinental railway line (connecting Adelaide and Darwin, via Port Augusta).

The Northern line from Adelaide terminates at Oodnadatta, about 100 miles south of the southern boundary of the Territory. The only line at present in the Territory is one from Darwin to Katherine, a length of 200 miles, of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge; and Katherine is distant about 1,045 miles from Oodnadatta. The line from Katherine River to connect with the Oodnadatta is in course of survey, the work having been completed as far south as Daly Waters Telegraph Station. It is stated that this transcontinental railway would bring London within seventeen days of Adelaide. The Commonwealth also acquired on 1st January, 1911, the property in the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta.

Posts.—The principal mail services are as follows:

(i.) Marine. Postal communication is maintained between Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, via North Queensland ports. The service extends to China and Japan. There is also a quarterly contract service between Darwin and Boroloola, calling half-yearly at Roper River; and a service every two months between Darwin and Wyndham, on the estuary of Ord River, in the northeast of Western Australia. These are subsided according to agreement for three years, the amount for the first service being £350; and for the second, £125 per voyage.

(ii.) Inland. Posts are also despatched into the interior of the Continent. One route is from the Katherine Telegraph Station southwards as far as Alice Springs. Others are from Katherine to Boroloola, from Camooweal to Boroloola, from Katherine to Victoria River and Wane Hill and from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. These services are maintained with difficulty, on account of the many hardships caused by the alternations of extreme drought and flood.

Other inland routes are served, and there is a frequent service in Darwin.

Telegraphs.—The transcontinental telegraph line, covering a length of 2,230 miles, was completed on 2nd August, 1872, at a cost of nearly half-a-million sterling. The line runs in a northerly direction from Adelaide to Darwin, whence telegraphic communication is provided with Asia and Europe, via Banjoewangie (Java), Singapore and Madras.

Between Darwin and Banjoewangie the submarine cable is duplicated.

Land Tenure.

The system of land settlement in the Northern Territory has been reorganised by the Commonwealth Government. The Lands Ordinances of 1912, 1913 and 1914, regulate the future disposal of land in the Territory. A leasehold system only is provided for, and no further alienation of Crown lands will be permitted, unless such alienation is in pursuance of existing agreements. The classification and control of Crown lands is in the hands of a Board, consisting of the Director of Lands, the Director of Agriculture, and the Chief Surveyor. The classified land is leased in blocks, the maximum area ranging from 300 square miles of first-class pastoral to 1280 acres of first-class agricultural land. Before offering any land for leasing, the Board fixes the annual rental, but every lease is subject to reappraisement of rent at specified periods, viz., every 14 years in the case of town lands, and every 21 years in the case of agricultural and pastoral lands.

Leases under these Ordinances are in perpetuity, except as regards pastoral and miscellaneous leases, the term of which is 21 or 42 years, according to the quality of the land leased.

The lessee must reside on the land leased for a certain period every year, must fence, stock, and cultivate it to the extent prescribed, and must, within two years of the commencement of the lease, establish a home on it. In order to promote settlement in the Territory, the first five thousand blocks of agricultural land taken up on perpetual lease under this Ordinance will be rent free during the life of the applicant, or for 21 years from the commencement of the lease, whichever period is longer.

Many farms have already been surveyed on the Daly river, varying in size from 290 to 620 acres, and are now being allotted. The Government provides fencing, building materials, implements, and stock at cost price, and on long terms, or advances the money required for their purchase.

The various types of leases, licenses, and permits current are as follows:—(i.) Agricultural leases; (ii.) pastoral leases; (iii.) special leases; (iv.) leases with right of purchase; (v.) tropical products leases; (vi.) leases for horsebreeding stations; (vii.) licenses; and (viii.) pastoral and other permits.
(i.) Area held under Lease, License and Permit.

The following table shows the total area held under lease, license, and permit at the end of the year 1901, and from 1907 to 1916.

PAPUA.

Situation and Area.

Papua (formerly called British New Guinea) is composed of a portion of the island of New Guinea, and of a number of islands, most of which lie to the south-east of New Guinea. The boundaries of the Territory are as follows:—"The S. and S.E. shores of New Guinea, from 141° E. long., eastward as far as East Cape, thence N.W. to 8° S. lat., in the neighbourhood of Mitre Rock, together with the territory lying south of a line from Mitre Rock, proceeding along the said 8° S. parallel to 147° E. long., then in a straight line N.W. to the..."
intersection of 6° S. lat. and 144° E. long., and continuing W.N.W. to the intersection of 5° S. lat. and 141° E. long. together with the Trobriand, Woodlark, D'Entrecasteaux, and Louisiade groups of islands, and all other islands lying between 8° and 12° S. lat. and between 141° and 155° E. long., and not forming part of Queensland; and including all islands and reefs lying in the Gulf of Papua to the north of 8° S. lat."

New Guinea, the largest island in the world if Australia is excluded, lies some 80 miles to the north of Queensland, between 0° 0' and 12° 0' S. lat., and between 130° 50' and 154° 30' E. long. Its greatest length is 1,490 miles, and its maximum breadth 430 miles; its area being about 234,768 square miles. The islands which lie near Papua, and which form part of the Territory, number, great and small, about two hundred. Of these the principal ones are: Kiriwina (in the Trobriand group of D'Entrecasteaux), Woodlark, Normanby, Goodenough, Fergusson, St. Aignan, Rossel and Sudest.

History.

The island of New Guinea was discovered in 1511 by Antonio de Abrea, and it was touched at by several of the early navigators. The Archipelagos lying to the south-east of New Guinea were discovered by French navigators towards the close of the eighteenth century. The waters that are adjacent to the Archipelagos, and to the south-eastern coasts of New Guinea, have at different periods been partly surveyed and mapped by British ships of war.

The whole island to the west of 141° E. long. is claimed by the Dutch as suzerains of the Sultan of Tidore. The Dutch have established a post on the south coast of New Guinea, known as Merauké, which is in charge of a Resident. It is a little to the West of the S.W. extreme of the Anglo-Dutch boundary. That portion of the island which lies to the eastward of 141° E. long. and to the north of British New Guinea belonged to the German Empire. The acquisition by the British Crown of the portion of the island not claimed by Holland was long advocated by Australian statesmen, and the growing influence of France and Germany in the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the establishment of a penal settlement in the French island of New Caledonia, created some alarm in Australia lest a country lying so near to Australia as New Guinea should pass into the hands of a foreign Power. To prevent this from taking place as regards the eastern part of New Guinea, the Government of Queensland annexed it to the Empire on the 4th of April, 1883, but this proceeding was not ratified by the Imperial Government. The Intercolonial Convention held at Sydney in Nov. and Dec., 1883, passed resolutions urging the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, and undertook to recommend their respective Legislatures to provide for defraying a part of the cost of a Protectorate if one were established by the Imperial Government. On the Australasian colonies agreeing to guarantee 15,000£ a year to meet the cost, a Protectorate was proclaimed by Commodore Erskine on the 6th November, 1884, over the south-east coast of New Guinea and the adjacent islands.

General Sir Peter Scratchley was appointed Special Commissioner for the Protectorate, and arrived in 1885, but he succumbed, in the Protectorate, to malarial fever in November of the same year. He was succeeded by the Hon. John Douglas, C.M.G., formerly Premier of Queensland.

At the Colonial Conference held in 1887, the Colonies of Queensland, N.S. Wales and Victoria undertook to guarantee 15,000£ a year for ten years, for defraying the cost of administering the territory now forming the Possession, on the understanding that Her Majesty's Sovereignty would be proclaimed over it. By the Queensland British New Guinea Act, 1887, that colony undertook to be responsible for the payment of the 15,000£ a year. The territory was annexed to the Crown by the newly appointed Administrator, Dr. (now Sir W.) Macgregor, on 4th September, 1888.

The Imperial Government has contributed some 52,000£ towards the founding of the Possession. The local revenue raised in the Possession was formerly paid over to Queensland, for distribution amongst the guaranteeing colonies, in reduction of their contribution of 15,000£ a year, but is now kept and expended by the Government of the Possession.

At the end of 1901 the Government of the Commonwealth agreed to take over the Possession as a territory of the Commonwealth, and brought proposals before the Federal Parliament (which were adopted) for providing towards the expenses of administration a sum not exceeding 20,000£ a year. The provision ran from 1st July, 1901, and was subject to revision at the end of five years. On the 1st Sept., 1906, a Proclamation was issued by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, under the provisions of the Papua Act, 1905, declaring British New Guinea a Territory of the Commonwealth, under the name of "Papua." The above Act provides that a sum of £20,000 shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth towards the revenue of the Territory in each financial year, up to and including 30th June, 1906, and thereafter such sums, if any, as the Parliament appropriates for that purpose. In 1914-15, 30,000£ was paid by the Commonwealth towards Administration.

Description and Formation.

It extends from east to west upwards of 800 miles, and about 200 from north to south towards either end, but is only about 50 miles deep behind Freshwater Bay, near the middle of the portion of the colony that is situated on the island of New Guinea. The total coast line of the Possession has been computed at 3,664 statute miles, 1,728 on the mainland and 1,936 on the islands. The total superficial area is about 90,540 square miles, of which about 87,786 are on the mainland of New Guinea, and 2,754 made up of many islands.

With the exception of the low coral islands of Kiriwina, Nada, part of Murua, and a few others of small dimensions, the islands are mountainous and principally of schistose formation, the highest, Goodenough, 8,000 feet. The eastern end of the Territory is also mountainous, and as the mountains extend westward they rise and coalesce to form a great central chain, which attains its greatest altitudes in the Owen Stanley range, the highest point of which is Mount Victoria, 13,200 feet, and in Mount Scratchley, the Wharton Range, and Mount Albert Edward, the latter about the same height as Mount Victoria. Further west the main range becomes more broken and lower, while pursuing nearly the same general trend towards the north-west as it had in the more eastern part of the colony. The western end of the Territory is for nearly 300 miles generally low and swampy until a long...
distance from the coast is reached. The mountains near the east end, on the mainland, are of igneous origin; the great masses of the central part of the main range are all schistose, while in the west sandstone predominates, but there are outcrops of igneous formation, such as Mount Yule, upwards of 10,000 feet high. On the Fly River, near the point of junction of British, Dutch, and German territory, there are limestones with fossil corals, and these are also met with at many other places in the low and swampy regions of the western end of the colony and elsewhere. The whole Territory is remarkably well watered. The great mountains, and by far the larger portion of the lower country, are all covered by forest.

Rivers.

The majority of the principal rivers open into the Gulf of Papua. They have a general direction towards a point near the middle of the Gulf. The two largest are the Fly and the Purari. The Fly spreads out its head branches over a large area in the centre of the island, comprising considerable portions of the three different territories. Its course is about 620 miles from the sea to the British-German boundary. The influence of the tide is felt for six or seven score of miles up the Fly. It is navigable by a steam launch for over 500 miles.

The Purari River is the second in point of size, and seems to start from the southern side of the Bismarck range of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. It is navigable by steam launch for 120 miles. The Bailala and Lakekamu rise in undetermined mountains in the central main range. The Angabunga River has its origin from the western spurs of Mount Albert Edward; the Vanapa from the Owen Stanley Range, the Wharton Chain and the southern slopes of Mount Albert Edward; the Brown from the Owen Stanley Range east of Mount Victoria. On the northeast coast the rivers are all small, except four that open into the sea between Cape Nelson and the British-German boundary. These are, proceeding northwards, the Musa, Kumusi, Mambare, and Gira. Each of them pursues a course from the central main range towards the north-east until it enters the sea. The Gira rises from the eastern spurs of Mount Albert Edward, and is smaller than the other three, all of which are nearly of the same size.

Climate and Natural Resources.

As Papua lies between five and eleven and a half degrees of south latitude, the climate of the lower part of the country is warm. It is outside the range of the hurricanes that pervade the southern part of the Western Pacific. At Port Moresby, the seat of Government, and situated near the middle of the colony, the average temperature for the year 1914-15 at 9 a.m. was 80°1. The average maximum readings for the same period, 85°2; the average minimum readings, 75°0. The hot season is from November to May; the hottest months are January and February; the cold season is from June to October, the coldest month is August. During the hot season winds on the south coast are from the north and west, and are unsteady; during the cold season they are from the south-east, and are much more regular.

At Port Moresby the rainfall for the year 1914-15 was 26'315 inches. It is much greater, but undetermined, on the central mountain ranges. On the south coast the climate is rather comfortable than oppressive during the cold season. It is generally agreeable at an altitude of 2,000 feet, a height that can be reached on foot in one day from Port Moresby. At 5,000 to 6,000 feet it becomes distinctly cold at night, the thermometer sometimes reading 56° F.; at 10,000 feet ice is met with in the early morning. Above that the grass is often covered with hoar frost, and the cold is severe.

Malarial fever, of a type that is as a rule comparatively mild, is not rare in the low parts of the country. About the time of the change of seasons inflammatory diseases of the chest frequently occur among natives.

There exists there the obstinate scaly ringworm, common in many parts of the Pacific. A mild form of Yaws, not nearly so severe as it is in the Pacific Islands, is indigenous. Sporadic cases of elephantiasis and leprosy are met with, but these have not affected any European. Lupus and simple ulcers are common, and rheumatism is not unknown. Beriberi is also met with in some districts. There is no scarlet fever, croup or diphtheria. Typhoid fever, smallpox, and Asiatic cholera have not appeared, but unfortunately dysentery has been introduced. Cases of cancer have been seen in the country. Such diseases as tape-worm and guinea-worm are unknown. Ankylostomiasis has recently been discovered in the coastal villages of Port Moresby.

The climate is favourable to the cultivation of all tropical products. The cocoanut palm bears well everywhere, and is common anywhere along the coast line, but in the far interior it is not met with. Cotton would be specially suited to the dry climate of the central district. Tobacco, in certain localities, of superior quality, and sugar cane seem to be indigenous or to be long domesticated; there are several native trees and plants that yield good classes of rubber. There are some good varieties of timber, including sandalwood, ebony, and cedar. Tea, coco, and coffee thrive well, but are not indigenous; the latter has been introduced and propagated. The climate is very congenial to rice and maize and all kinds of tropical fruit. The mineral deposits comprise gold, which exist over a large area; osmiridium, which has been found from the Gira River to the Owen Stanley Range; and in the Purari sandstone district there is coal. Indications of petroleum have been located between the Purari and Vailala Rivers along a coastal belt of twelve miles. Boring operations are being proceeded with on the latter river and samples of good quality have been obtained and used in an oil engine with very satisfactory results.

The marine resources comprise pearl-shell and pearls, trepang, sponges, and turtle shell.

Fauna and Flora.

There are no dangerous wild beasts in the Territory; wild swine are common. There are several varieties of wallaby, phalanger, and echidna. There are no deer, hares, or rabbits; the most dangerous creature is the crocodile. Many lives are lost each year through these amphibians and by snake-bite. The snakes are nearly related to those of Australia. The birds include the cassowary, many birds of paradise, a great variety of pigeons, the hornbill, the black and the white cockatoo, geese, many species of ducks, quails, and on the mountain tops snipe and woodcock.

The flora is as varied as the climate. On the tops of the highest mountain chains there are many species of grasses; several kinds of buttercup, forget-me-nots, daisies, rhododendrons, heaths, and other flowers of temperate climates.
The forest there is principally cypress. From seven to ten thousand feet it is chiefly myrtaceous, often covered by trailing bamboo or mixed with pandanus. From two to five thousand feet the evergreen oaks are common. On the low lands there are several varieties of hardwood trees, azfic bijuga, calophyllum, etc. Native cloth is made by beating out the bark of the paper mulberry, of the bread fruit tree, or of certain trees of the nettle family. Fibre is obtained from the banana, the cocoanut, from the bark of many saplings, and the best of all from the aerial roots of certain species of pandanus. Most of the trees and flowers that are met with in the tropical islands of the Pacific, or in North Queensland, occur also in Papua.

The People.

All the native tribes of the Territory that have up to now been met with seem to belong to the same race; they present, however, well-marked differences in physical appearance, disposition, language and customs, but not greater than the circumstances would lead one to expect. No clear trace of an older or earlier race than the existing one has been discovered. The present inhabitants doubtless arrived in the country when it was already covered by dense forest; this must have had its effect in separating the people into secluded, shy, and suspicious communities. To this is due the notable diversities so common between the communities of even adjacent districts, each being confined strictly to its own small territory, subject to circumscribed local influences. Thus, for example, the tribes on the Fly and other estuaries have, for generations, had only brackish water; others water running over calcareous formation, or over slate, lava, granite, etc., a circumstance that would perhaps differentiate quite as much as the great variety of food. Some tribes live almost exclusively on sago, others on yams and taro, some on bananas, others principally on sweet potatoes. Many tribes live continuously in a heavy, moist, warm atmosphere near the coast line; others in the light and bracing climate of the mountains at an altitude of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The average size of a Papuan is less than that of an average European. The race affinities with the Pacific are strong; on the coast line there is a small percentage of a smooth-haired Malay-like element that is absent in the interior. The isolation of the different communities has led to such diversities of dialect that people living only a few miles apart cannot understand each other's speech. There is a well-marked relationship to the languages of Polynesia, and this extends, especially in place names, right across the colony, but it becomes weaker in ordinary language as one proceeds towards the west. The dialects are easy to acquire, containing as they do few or no sounds that cannot be represented by the English alphabet, or easily pronounced by an English-speaking person. English is now making considerable progress. The European population is 1,036 and other aliens number 671 persons; the native population is estimated at about 271,000. The country and people have no history, and but few current well-defined traditions. These refer to only local movements and actions of tribes within the last four or five generations.

Mode of Government.

Papua had formerly the constitution of a Crown colony, regulated by Royal letters patent of 8th June, 1888, under which the Government was carried on by an Administrator, with the advice and assistance of an executive and a legislative council. The correspondence of the Administrator of British New Guinea with the Secretary of State passed first through the Governor of Queensland, and afterwards through the Governor-General of Australia. By Letters Patent, of 18th March, 1902, provision was made for placing the Possession under the authority of the Commonwealth, and for the revocation of the Letters Patent governing the Constitution as soon as the Commonwealth Parliament had provided by law for the future government. Provision was made by the Papua Act, 1906, proclaimed on the 1st September, 1906, as above stated. There was no form of Government among the native population, the Polynesian system of chiefs being practically unknown; patriarchal authority did not extend beyond near family relatives, and even then was only loose. A certain measure of chiefly influence is being created now by a few men under Government authority, but control over the natives is being best acquired by the gradual creation of a force of village policemen. The Administration has at its disposal an armed constabulary, consisting of about 301 natives, enrolled from many different districts. Special laws have been passed for the protection of the native population, and for dealing with lands. A code consisting of a series of simple regulations, which are from time to time being added to, has also been passed for the benefit of the native population. The general law of the Territory is the same as that of Queensland. The courts of the Possession consist of the Central, Petty Sessions, and Native Magistrates' Courts.

Manufactures and Industries.

There are no European manufactories in the Possession.

The chief industry worked by Europeans is gold mining. The number of miners has varied at different times from 100 to 800 men. Gold to the value of over 39,710l. in 1906-7, 52,837l. in 1907-8, 54,969l. in 1908-9, 54,927l. in 1909-10, 68,705l. for 1910-11, 49,316l. for 1911-12, 62,332l. for 1912-13, 47,233l. for 1913-14, 50,889l. for 1914-15, for 1915-16, 37,904l., for 1916-17, 32,839l., was declared at the custom house for export. It was nearly all obtained by alluvial mining. The gold-bearing country is extensive, but it is for various reasons very difficult to prospect. There are also indications of auriferous reefs, and several crushing plants have been established on Woodlark Island. Pearls, 1906-7, 1,700l.; 1907-8, 3,310l.; 1908-9, 1,529l.; 1909-10, 4,290l.; 7,635l. for 1910-11, 9,605l. for 1911-12, 9,284l. for 1912-13; 4,602l. for 1913-14; 6,113l. for 1914-15; 1,000l. for 1915-16; 2,400l. for 1916-17. The pearl-shell fishery is of some importance; pearl-shell was exported in 1905-6, 502l.; 1906-7, 728l.; 1907-8, 157l.; 1908-9, 685l.; 1909-10, 1,445l.; 1,114l. for 1910-11; 2,442l. for 1911-12; 8,512l. for 1912-13; 11,212l. for 1913-14; 4,292l. for 1914-15.; 7,002l. for 1915-16. The shell is widely distributed over the eastern seas of the colony, but large areas of water are difficult to work on account of their depth. Beche-de-mer is found on most of the reefs, and will always figure as a small industry, 1905-6, 3,027l.; 1906-7, 1,960l.; 1907-8, 1,069l.; 1908-9, 286l.; 1909-10, 1,71l.; 180l. for 1910-11; 1,355l. for 1911-12; 1,871l. for 1912-13; 2,857l. for 1913-14; 3,858l. for 1914-15.; 3,229l. for 1915-16; 2,521l. for 1916-17. Sandal-wood to the value of 2,522l. was exported in 1905-6; 1906-7, 3,932l.; 1907-8, 6,346l.; 1908-9, 2,701l.; 1909-10, 4,628l.; 190l. for 1910-11; 269l. for
1911-12; 74l. for 1912-13; 85l. for 1913-14; 1,363l. for 1914-15; 1,416l. for 1915-16; 633l. for 1916-17. It is sometimes found in the form of large trees, so far only in the central district on the mainland. It commands a fair price in the market. The rubber industry (1906-7; 1,385l.; 1907-8; 483l.; 1908-9; 113l.; 1909-10; 904l.; 2,064l. for 1910-11; 935l. for 1911-12; 517l. for 1912-13; 1,538l. for 1913-14; 1,501l. for 1914-15; 14,846l. for 1915-16; 26,682l. for 1916-17) is important. The indigenous rubber commands a comparatively high price in the London market. Up to the last few years no systematic efforts had been made to plant cocoanuts. The old trees are only in small clumps, except in a few instances, and in those exceptional cases the groves are the property of large communities, who make extensive use of the cocoanut as an article of food. Many nuts are now being planted, but the amount available for copra-making (1906-6, 829 tons, 9,315l.; 1906-7, 7,467l.; 1907-8, 7,515l.; 1908-9, 13,376l.; 1909-10, 29,498l.; 17,837l. for 1910-11; 19,363l. for 1911-12; 16,912l. for 1912-13; 20,063l. for 1913-14; 12,693l. for 1914-15; 19,051l. for 1915-16; 40,882l. for 1916-17) is likely to reach a high figure. There are large sago fields in the colony, but this article has not yet been worked for export. There can be no reasonable doubt that the sugar cane, which is indigenous and present in a great many varieties, and cotton, tea, vanilla, and tobacco, which is domesticated, and of exceptionally fine quality, will eventually be made into great industries.

External Trade.

The custom's tariff is comparatively a light one; ad valorem duties do not exceed 10 per cent. The external trade is chiefly with Queensland and New South Wales. The external trade, imports and exports, as entered at the customs, amounted in 1905-6, 160,051l.; 1906-7, 151,532l.; 1907-8, 174,677l.; 1908-9, 174,372l.; 1909-10; 220,776l.; 1910-11, 320,320l.; 335,359l. for 1911-12; 346,339l. for 1912-13.; 335,274l. for 1913-14; 296,409l. for 1914-15; 348,468l. for 1915-16; 428,175l. for 1916-17.

Two steamers belonging to Messrs. Burns, Philp and Co. are under contract for the conveyance every six weeks of mails and passengers to and from the Territory, and a small steamer of the same Company plies to and from Thursday Island, calling at all ports on the Papuan coast including the Islands of Samarai, Misima, Woodlark, Kiriwina and Thursday Island. The coasting and general inter-island trade is carried on by means of several small steamers and some small cutters or luggers, many of which are manned exclusively by Papuans. There are suitable substantial wharves for working cargo at Port Moresby and Samarai, at which places all manner of supplies are obtainable at reasonable prices. Macadamised roads are in course of construction. Much of the internal communication will be made by the rivers. Tracks have been cut in many directions, and the natives are becoming accustomed to travel alone or with Europeans over great areas. During the south-east trades travelling by small boat is uncomfortable and difficult west of Yule Island, where there is no barrier reef; but east of that the coast is largely protected. East of Yule Island harbours and good anchorages are numerous. In the interior travelling is done always on foot, but in the central district horses can be used on many tracks.

Magisterial Divisions.

The Territory is divided into ten magisterial divisions, in each of which there is a resident magistrate, who is also invested with the executive authority of dealing in the first instance with any administrative matter that may arise. Besides these there are assistant resident magistrates with limited judicial powers in certain more populous districts. The Central Court, which possesses the jurisdiction of an ordinary Supreme Court, sits wherever there is occasion. The principal seat of Government is at Port Moresby. This place is centrally situated. It is easy to approach the harbour, and the latter is large, commodious, and sheltered from all winds. The population of Port Moresby consists of about 1,600 natives and some 425 Europeans. It is not well watered, but is very picturesque, and comparatively healthy. The immediate neighbourhood is not well suited for ordinary cultivation on account of the rather scanty rainfall. Port Moresby is a port of entry.

Samarai, the next place in importance, is an island of some sixty acres two miles from the south-east end of the mainland. There is no native village on that island. It is a port of entry, and the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate of the district. There is good anchorage there, but no convenient water supply. It is the port from which miners, pearl fishers, etc., generally obtain their supplies. Like Port Moresby, the neighbourhood of Samarai is very picturesque. Its rainfall is nearly three times as great as at the former place.

The third port of entry is the island of Daru, the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate for the Western Division. It has a good and safe harbour, with an approach that presents no difficulty. It is the only harbour Papua possesses in the west, and the island supplies the best building sites obtainable in that part of the country. It is visited by many boats engaged in the pearl-shell fishery of Torres Straits.

The fourth port of entry is Bonagai, in Woodlark Island.

Summary.

Papua differs from all other countries in its newness. A large part of the interior is still in the stone age, much of it is in a stage of transition in which the stone axe and the steel tomahawk are used side by side. The aboriginal methods of house-building, of canoe-making, of pottery manufacture, of cultivation, are still generally maintained. About half of the coast line has been brought under missionary influence, and there are several stations on the larger rivers.

Four missionary societies are established in the Territory. They are the London Missionary Society, which has for its field the south coast of New Guinea; the Society of the Sacred Heart, which is established at Yule Island, and along the banks of the St. Joseph River; the Methodist Missionary Society of Australasia, which extends its influence over all the archipelagos; and the Church of England Mission, which has as its field the north-east coast of New Guinea, the last-named constituting the Diocese of New Guinea, organised under a Bishop of the Church of England. The two first-named societies were in New Guinea before annexation was proclaimed: the last two have come there since the proclamation of sovereignty. The native population take readily to civilisation in most great matters, while they often cling tenaciously to their own habits and customs in smaller and less important things.

NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of three small islands lying 930 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 4' S. lat. and 167° 59' E. long., the other islets being Philip and Nepean Islands. They comprise altogether about 15 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there. This was removed in 1856, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 194 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The Pitcairn Islanders were the descendants of the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," who occupied Pitcairn in 1790, and were removed at their own request to Norfolk Island. Of these 40 returned to Pitcairn. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population at the census of 1911 was males 407, females 385, Melanesians, males 161, females 32, total 986. The chief occupation is agriculture, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The island was on the 24th June, 1856, placed under the control of the Governor of New South Wales, who was given power to appoint officers, make laws and grant lands. On 1st July, 1914, the island was made a territory of the Commonwealth. The office of the administration is the Department of Home and Territories, Melbourne (Minister for Home and Territories, Hon. P. McM. Glynn, M.P., Secretary, Atlee Arthur Hunt, C.M.G.). It is a station of the Pacific Cable Board. Communication is maintained once every 5 weeks by steamer from Sydney. There is a resident doctor. Education is free, and there is an efficient school which is conducted by a head master (Mr. Middenway) placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government by the Department of Public Instruction, New South Wales. The village is Kingston.
