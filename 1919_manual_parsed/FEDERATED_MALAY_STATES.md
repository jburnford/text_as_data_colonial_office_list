# FEDERATED MALAY STATES

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Pérak in 1818.

For some years previous to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Pérak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Pérak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Pérak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889 by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1886 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. Clementi Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Pérak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Chief Secretary and to the High Commissioner for the Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States,* to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Pérak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Pérak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

No further meetings of this nature have been held since 1903, as the necessity for them has been removed by an important development of the principle of Federation, which was introduced in 1909. In that year a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to

* The title of this post has now been altered to Chief Secretary.
the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." The Council consists of the High Commissioner, as President, the Chief Secretary, the Sultans of Perak, Selangor and Pahang, the Yam Tuan of Negri Sembilan, the four British Residents, the Legal Adviser and four unofficial members, nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. Provision is made in the agreement for the addition, if desired, of the heads of one or more public departments and of a corresponding number of unofficials. The Council meets at least once a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the four States. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

Railways.

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (120 miles), extending from Johore Bahru to the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore Island, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas, the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Selangor, and Perak, then enters Province Wellesley, passing Prai—the port opposite Penang Harbour—about 472 miles from Johore Bahru, and thence proceeds through the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis.

The Federated Malay States Railways section of the Penang-Bangkok Railway was completed and opened for traffic to Padang Besar station on the boundary on 1st July, 1918, the distance from Johore Bahru to the boundary station being 562 miles.

The Southern section of the Siamese State Railways from Bangkok to Ootapao and from Ootapao to Padang Besar, the Junction station, with the Federated Malay States Railways, was opened for through traffic on 1st July, 1918.

The East Coast Line proceeds Northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan and Pahang, and is completed as far as Kuala Lipis—the capital of Pahang—261½ miles from Johore Bahru. Between Kuala Lipis and Tanah Merah in Kelantan a distance of 183 miles, the permanent location of the line has been definitely decided and construction is now proceeding northward of Kuala Lipis. A section of 32 miles in Kelantan, between Tanah Merah and Tumpat, on the East coast, is open for traffic. Between this section and Ootapao Junction (mentioned above) construction is proceeding on the length of 12 miles on the Kelantan side of the frontier, and also on the Siamese section of 145 miles between the Siamese boundary and Ootapao Junction.

From Ootapao Junction to Bangkok is 576 miles. The distance between Johore Bahru and Bangkok by rail will thus be 1,169 miles by the West Coast route, and nearly the same by the East Coast.

In addition to the two main lines in the Federated Malay States system, there are many branch lines. For the most part, they connect the ports with the main line: such for instance as the lines to Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Port Weld, and Prai, on the West Coast, and to Tumpat on the East Coast.

The total mileage now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States railway administration is 929½ miles.

The line is on the metre gauge. On the mail trains on the West Coast main line there are sleeping saloons and restaurant cars. The expenditure on capital account (including lines not open for traffic), was $105,388,013 up to 31st December, 1917, and this has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States.

Pérak.

H.H. Tsandai Shah ibni Almerhum Rathiallah, Sultan.

Pérak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State, which has an area of 7,800 square miles, is well watered, the Pérak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus), the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills, on Gunong Kledang, and on Gunong Arang Para, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 70,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Pérak is 826 of metalled and 45 of unmetalled cart roads, 1,013 miles of bridle and other paths.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Pérak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally
ceeded to PéraK, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory, which was taken over on the 16th July, 1909*, and incorporated in the Upper PéraK District, exceeds 1,000 square miles in area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legeh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasek on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

Sélángor.

H.H. Sir Ala'idin Suleiman ibni Almerhum Raja Musa, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Sélángor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by PéraK, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

The total area is estimated at 3,156 square miles, with a coast line extending for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between PéraK and Sélángor, the Sélángor, the Klang and the Langat. The inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in PéraK, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines.

The climate is uniform, and may be described as hot and moist. The nights are cool. The average maximum temperature in the low country is 91 and the average minimum temperature is 71. The rainfall varies considerably, as much as 124 inches having been registered. The wettest seasons are during March and April, and from October to December.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Sélángor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Sélángor.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 46,718 (1911 Census). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 59 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence. The telegraph system extends all over the State, and the telephone, with the exchanges at Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Port Swettenham, Kuala Sélángor, Banting, Kajang, Raisang and Kuala Kubu, is worked over about 4,489 miles of wire. In addition, there are 15 miles of underground cable containing 1,467 miles of wire.

There are 75 schools in the State; 65 are maintained by Government for education in native languages, the remainder are grants-in-aid schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels, exclusive of native craft, registered in 1917 was 2,030,936.

The total revenue of the State in 1917, was $23,948,757, and the expenditure $14,920,428.

There is no public debt.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land. The only import duties are those charged on opium and spirituous liquors, beer, petroleum, and tobacco. In 1917 the gross total value of imports was $37,277,425, and the exports $101,830,247.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1917 was 184,135 pikulas, valued at $19,916,064. The area alienated for mining is 63,887 acres, and a labour force of 41,565 is employed in this industry. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress some years ago, but has now been almost entirely abandoned owing to the fall in price. There are 46,928 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides. Most of the large estates have been converted into or sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1917 the area under rubber cultivation was approximately 344,230 acres. The value of cultivated rubber exported during 1917 was $77,784,865.

The road mileage is: metalled roads, 648; gravelled roads, 86; unmetalled roads, 29; and bridle paths, 160 miles.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Sir Muhammad, K.C.M.G., Yang di Pertuan of Sri Menanti, and Chiefs.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan dates, as at present constituted, from 1895, but a similar Federation was already in existence before that year. The present Federation consists of the following States: Sungei Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungei Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at the Coast, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Kuala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and at Tampin.

The total area of the State is about 2,550 square miles. The population, which stood at 130,199 at the census taken in 1911 and is now estimated at 137,887 is mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Tamils.

The value of imports amounted to $6,412,001 in 1917, and that of exports to $38,408,918. The revenue of the State, which in 1917 amounted to $7,182,461, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1917, 18,022 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 419,085 acres for

building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemencieh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative. The Malay population, numbering some 72,628, is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coco-nuts.

During 1917 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:—Rubber 220,000 acres, rice 26,400 acres, and coco-nuts 3,933 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses 67 Malay vernacular schools, two English schools and one Tamil school.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 417 miles of metalled and 9 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 263 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Sultan Abdullah bin Almerhum Sultan Ahmad Maitham Shah, Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, having an estimated area of some 14,000 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johora.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for house-boats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penium, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast line of the Federated Malay States Railways was opened for traffic as far as Kuala Lipis on the 15th October, 1917.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital, which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

There is a motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 83 miles, and from Raub to Bentong, via Tras and Tranum, a distance of 30 miles.

A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Raub, Kuala Lipis, and Bentong, and has been extended to Kuantan on the east coast.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan (104 miles), from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, and from Benta to Kuantan (147 miles), have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungai Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles.

The total revenue of the State during 1917 amounted to $2,498,141, and the expenditure to $1,921,682.

In the absence of complete records, it is only possible to estimate the population approximately at 140,000. The census of 1911 gave a total of 118,708.
