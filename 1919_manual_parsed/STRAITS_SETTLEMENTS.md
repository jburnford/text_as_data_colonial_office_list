# STRAITS SETTLEMENTS

Straits Settlements.

The Straits Settlements, comprising Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 217 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement, which now comprises also Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 108 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 280 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 720 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 183 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed, by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ½ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers about 795.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and placed under the administration of the Governor
of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 62 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 12 miles, and its greatest breadth about 9 miles. The inhabitants, who number about 1,100, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employees of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1906 to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17th March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. At first unimportant, that trade has now assumed enormous proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 280 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1806 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the occasion at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end in 1377, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca, under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 10 official members and 8 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

Climate.

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1917 was 81°8' F.; in Penang, 82°2' F.; in Province Wellesley, 82°0' F.; and in Malacca, 81°5' F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 86°8' and 74°3' F. There are no well-marked rainy
and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1908 to 1917, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 177 wet days; the average rainfall for the same period being 103.76 inches. In 1917 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 111.88 inches; in Penang 103.27 inches; in Province Wellesley 84.88 inches; in Malacca 109.83 inches; and in the Dindings 102.28 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have southeast, south or southwest winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.

The estimated population for the year 1918 is as follows:

|                | SINGAPORE.* | PENANG.† | MALACCA. | Total |
|----------------|-------------|----------|----------|-------|
|                | Male. Female | Male. Female | Male. Female | Male. Female |
| Europeans and Americans | 4,936 1,941 | 863 411 | 265 97 | 6,064 2,449 |
| Eurasians       | 2,694 2,890 | 828 1,028 | 888 1,018 | 4,410 4,936 |
| Asiatics        | 254,176 103,140 | 184,747 114,165 | 88,800 57,984 | 527,723 275,289 |

* Inclusive of Christmas, Cocos-Keeling and Labuan Islands.
† Inclusive of Province Wellesley and Dindings.

Trade.

The ports are, except in the case of petroleum, opium, liquors and tobacco, free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmeg, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, para rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, preserved pineapples, dyestuffs, tobacco, etc. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are tapioca, rice and rubber (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and pineapples and rubber (in Singapore). The approximate quantities of some of the exports and imports in 1916 were:

EXPORTS:

The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the Continent of Europe, the United States, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and the Malay States. Singapore and George Town (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had, on the 31st December, 1916, 579 vessels registered, of a total net tonnage of 88,096 tons.

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe twice a week by the fortnightly services of the P. and O., or Messageries Maritimes, or British India Company's steamers; the first two via Ceylon, the last via Negapatam and Bombay; in addition there is a fortnightly service by the Steamship Company "Nederland"; and at frequent intervals by the Holt's, Chargeurs-Réunis, Glen, Shire, Japanese and other lines; with China and Japan thrice a fortnight by the P. and O. and M.M. lines, and by other lines frequently; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla via Hong Kong, and by Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok by Straits steamship and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Netherlands India Company's steamers; with Australian ports weekly and otherwise by P. and O. and Messageries Maritimes, via Ceylon; by British India, Burns Philp, Ocean Steamship Company, Western Australia Steam Navigation Company, and other lines; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, fortnightly by the British India Company's steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, British India, Apcar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, etc., by local lines. Most of the larger steamers
call at Penang. Letters from England reach Singapore in from 20 to 24 days, but all services are disarranged during the war.

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1917 to $14,760,563, the principal business done being with the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon, the Federated Malay States, and Netherlands East India.

Nine sub-marine cables radiate from Singapore: 4 to Penang, thence to Madras (2), Colombo (1), Delhi, Sumatra (1); 1 to Batavia, thence to Coos (1); 1 to Banjowangie, thence to Darwin (2); 1 to Hong Kong; 1 to Cochinchina, thence to Hong Kong; and 1 to Labuan, thence to Hong Kong. There are also Government telegraph lines from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Kedah, Negri Sembilan, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur was opened for traffic in June, 1909. There are 456 miles of telegraph line, 324 miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley and 10,472 miles of telephone line. There is a telephone exchange worked by the Oriental Telephone Company in Singapore, and exchanges are worked by the Post Office in Penang, Province Wellesley and Malacca. A railway, 23 miles long, connects Prai in Province Wellesley with the Perak railway system. A railway, 15 miles long, constructed by the Colonial Government, runs from the docks of Singapore† to Kranji, on the Straits of Johore. A railway connecting the town of Malacca with Pulau-Sebang, on the borders of Negri-Sembilan, forms part of the Federated Malay States Railway system.

Education.

The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children in Malacca.

Province Wellesley and Penang Island outside municipal limits. It is not compulsory in Singapore or Penang Town. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are sectarian. There is a reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1916 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 8 | 2,823 | 2,677 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 35 | 12,647 | 11,820 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 188 | 12,538 | 10,961 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 11 | 501 | 417 |
| Total. | 242 | 28,509 | 25,875 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively. The half-dollar is now unlimited legal tender.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the International Banking Corporation, the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; and Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, Chinese Commercial Bank, Communication Bank, The Yokohama Specie Bank.

† The extensive docks owned by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company were acquired by the Government in 1906, and are now controlled by a Board, composed of members appointed by the Governor under "the Straits Settlements Ports Ordinance." Graving and wet docks and other works are in progress.
The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation in 1916 was $176,032 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the undermentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec., 1899—$3,920,000
" " " " 1900—$6,106,000
" " " " 1901—$9,178,000
" " " " 30th June, 1902—$12,395,900
" " " " 1906—$17,209,105
" " " " 31st July, 1908—$22,331,705
" " " " 31st August, 1909—$27,569,475
" " " " 1910—$33,446,860
" " " " 1911—$35,448,760
" " " " 31st July, 1912—$40,467,407
" " " " 1913—$44,110,518
" " " " 1914—$43,834,548
" " " " 1915—$48,688,648
" " " " 1916—$64,018,317
" " " " 31st August, 1917—$85,012,496

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1916, the deposits amounted to $821,956.

A scheme was in 1902 drawn up for placing the salaries of the higher officers in the service of the S.S. and Federated Malay States Governments on a sterling basis from 1st January, 1903. Existing higher officers had the option of accepting a salary in sterling (to be paid in dollars locally according to a monthly rate of exchange), or, in the alternative, continuing to draw their dollar salary together with exchange compensation, i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar = 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave pay and pension at home. In 1907 a local allowance of 10 per cent. was sanctioned temporarily to the same officers.

In 1911 a revised scheme of salaries was prepared, and duty allowances of varying amounts are now granted in lieu of the 10 per cent.

The native Weights are:
1 kati = 16 tahil = 1½ lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 533¾ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipalities at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, administered by Boards of Commissioners, nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1916 was $5,491,352; and the expenditure $5,172,781.
