MALTA.

Malta is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. Valletta, its port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is about 95 square miles; that of Gozo 20 square miles.

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino mention is made at very early date. The Phoenicians settled in them in B.C. 1519, according to some authors, whilst others give the date B.C. 1400. Diodorus Siculus describes Malta and Gozo as most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. They were afterwards under the dominion of the Carthaginians. During the Punic wars the Maltese islands fell alternately to the lot of the Carthaginians and Romans, and were ultimately occupied by the latter. During the Roman occupation the shipwreck of Paul took place (Acts xxviii). On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell to the Goths, and then to the Saracens, who were expelled by Count Roger the Norman. It was under the dominion of the House of Aragon from 1190 until early in the sixteenth century, when it was granted by the Roman Emperor Charles V. to the Order of the Knights of St. John, by whom it was held for more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, Malta capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte. The Maltese, however, rose against their conquerors, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they were closely blockaded for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered, and Malta was taken possession of by Great Britain 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris 1814.

The climate of Malta is somewhat peculiar. In summer, during the daytime, the heat almost equals that experienced in the tropics. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind. The maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 61.5° Fahr., and the minimum 53.5°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is 82.5° Fahr., and the minimum 73.5°.

The island is highly cultivated; its principal products are cotton, potatoes, and corn; the vine is grown; oranges and figs are abundant; honey of a superior kind is also produced; and early crops of potatoes are exported to England.

During the year 1874, the great work begun by the late Sir Gaspar Le Marchant, namely, the extension of Malta Great Harbour, was finally completed, and the French Creek handed over to the Admiralty authorities, whilst the merchant shipping was moved into the newly-extended waters of the Marsa. The re-modelling of the drainage of the fortified towns has lately been completed. Another important work, the re-organization of the water supply, is now in progress, and it is hoped that on its completion, and by the carrying out of other hygienic measures, the reputation of Malta as a healthy sojourn and pleasant winter resort will be greatly enhanced.

Malta is connected with the undermentioned ports as follows:—

1. Gibraltar and England, by the P. & O. steamers, once a week.
2. Sicily and Italy, by Florio and Rubattino steamers, twice a week.
3. Sicily and Italy, by the Transatlantique Co.'s steamer once a week.
4. Marseilles and Naples by the Fraissinet Co.'s steamers, twice a month.
5. Port Said and India, by the P. & O. steamers, once a week.
6. Australia by the P. & O. steamers, twice a month.
7. Alexandria, by the Fraissinet Co.'s steamers, twice a month.
8. Cyprus, by the P. & O. steamers, via Port Said, once a week.
9. Tunis and Marseilles, by Messrs. Florio and Rubattino's steamers, once a week.
10. Tunis, by Mr. Golcher's steamers, "La Valette," or "Lancetfield," once a week.
11. Tunis, by the Transatlantique Co.'s steamers, once a week.
12. Tripoli, by Messrs. Florio and Rubattino's steamers, once a week.
13. Tripoli, by the Transatlantique Co.'s steamers, once a week.

The Government is administered by a governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, established in 1881, consisting of six members. Legislation is carried on by means of a partly elective council of government originally constituted by letters patent of 11th May, 1849. The Council of Government consists of a president and 17 members, 9 official and 8 elected. The constituency, under the letters patent of 2nd March, 1883, amounts to 10,627. The qualification for a member of Council is the possession of immovable property of the clear value of 100l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of rent for immovable property to the annual value of 10l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of 40l. a year for board and lodging, for the same period previous to election. The qualification for an elector is an income of 8l. per annum from immovable property, or payment of 4l. rent per annum, besides a competent knowledge of the English and Italian languages, or, independently of the above, an income from immovable property
of 6l. per annum, or the payment of rent to the amount of 6l. per annum for six calendar months before registration. The Council of Government, unless sooner dissolved, lasts five years. The governor is ex officio President, and the Lieut.-Governor and Chief Secretary Vice-President of the Council of Government.

Malta and Gozo are divided into two separate dioceses. The titular Archbishopric of Rhodes is attached to the See of Malta. The present Archbishop is Monsignor Carmelo Xicluna. In April, 1885 Monsignor A. M. Buhiar, Bishop of Ruspe, arrived in Malta as Administrator Apostolic and assumed the administration of the diocese. The present Bishop of Gozo is Monsignor Pietro Pace.

The most important sources of revenue in Malta are the Customs duties, levied under the following tariff:

MAURITIUS.

An island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 17' and 57° 46' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat., situated at a distance of 115 miles from Réunion, 940 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 708 square miles, having an extreme length of 36 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 28 miles from east to west. The only systematic triangulation of Mauritius ever made was that by the celebrated practical astronomer, Abbé de la Caille, who had been sent by the Government of France, in 1753, to determine the latitude and longitude of Mauritius and Bourbon.

The formation of the island is supposed to be volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude, with peaks rising to nearly 2,700 feet. Some of these, such as Pieter Both and the Pouce, have fantastic shapes, and have been described as "fingers pointing to Heaven." The highest peak is the Piton de la Rivière-Noire, which is 2,711 English feet, but Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable beyond a few hundred yards from the sea.

This famous and beautiful island, the fairer "Malta of the Indian Ocean" (as it is called by Thiers), was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507, but the first people that occupied it in any great numbers were the Dutch, in 1598, whose commander, Admiral J. C. Van Neck, named it Mauritius, in honour of the then Stadtholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. The Dutch, however, though they built a fort at Grand Port, do not appear to have made any permanent settlement, and they finally abandoned the island in 1712. A party of Frenchmen, sent from the neighbouring island of Réunion, landed there in 1715, and in 1721 it was formally taken possession of by the French, at first, on behalf of the French East India Company and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the Crown of France. The name of the island was then changed by M. Du Fresne, captain in the naval service of France, into that of Isle of France, which it retained till the landing of the English in 1810, when its former name of Mauritius was again restored to it. The most celebrated of the French Governors was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735—1746), "a man of eminent talents and virtues" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane, and of may other valuable plants, and was the real founder of the prosperity of the island. The first thing that strikes the foreigner on his landing in the island is a bronze statue which has been erected to that governor in 1859, on one of the public squares, facing the harbour of Port Louis. Mauritius was during the earlier part of the long
war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels and Indiamen, from the facility with which entries were made from it upon our traders by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810; the laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French nobles. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture. The natives are proud of their country, and of the designation of Creoles.

Six daily newspapers and other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language is spoken all over the island.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of nearly 70,000 souls. The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive more than a hundred vessels. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The annual trade of the island (including imports and exports), which passes almost entirely through Port Louis, is valued at about seven millions sterling, while the annual public revenue exceeds £200,000.

The principal public edifices of Port Louis are the Government House, the Institute, the Roman Catholic and Protestant cathedrals, the Royal College, the Town Hall, the theatre, &c.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg, so called in honour of M. Mahé de Labourdonnais.

The constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1844-85. It now consists of a Governor, with an Executive Council of five officials, and a Legislative Council of twenty-seven members, eight being ex-officio, nine nominated by the Governor, and ten elected on a moderate franchise—two for the town of Port Louis, and for each of the eight rural districts. Where ten non-official members vote together on any question of finance or purely local concern, the official vote is not to be counted.

Climate, &c.—From December to April is the hottest season of the year in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The temperature in the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The governor, the officer commanding the troops, and most of the official and other principal inhabitants, now reside in the charming climate of the uplands. The mean temperature at Curepipe, 1,800 feet above the sea, a place much resorted to of late years, and rapidly becoming a large town, resembles that of the South of France. The hurricane season extends from December to the middle of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 30° S. latitude. One of the severest hurricanes in this century was that of 1868 (11th and 12th March), when a considerable loss of property and life occurred, and some 50,000 persons were left houseless. The longest days are at the December solstice, and the shortest at the June solstice. The difference of time between Greenwich and Port Louis is three hours, forty-nine minutes, fifty-eight seconds, the latter in advance of the former.

Scenery, Field Sports, &c.—The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an Engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the last century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

Railways.—There are two lines of railway, the North Line and the Midland. The former runs between Port Louis and Grand River, S.E., a distance of 38 miles; the second line runs between Port Louis and Mahebourg, a distance of 34½ miles with branches to Savanne and Moka. The total number of miles of railway now open is 92. At Curepipe the elevation of the railway is 1,822 feet above the sea.

Telegraphic communication is established throughout the island.

Religion.—The Christian Churches are supported by State grants. According to the last census the Roman Catholics numbered 108,000, and the Protestants 8,000. The Roman Catholics receive Government aid amounting to 79,576 rupees, the Protestants receive 46,272 rupees.

Education.—The department of public instruction comprises two branches, the Royal College for higher education, and the Schools Department for primary education. The College is under the control of a Rector, who is assisted by a staff of professors. The Schools Department is under the direction of a Superintendent, aided by two Inspectors.

The Government schools are supported wholly by the State; the grant schools only partially so. The following table shows the numerical strength of each in 1883:

| Number | Pupils |
|--------|--------|
| Government schools | 57 | 7,152 |
| Grant schools | 57 | 5,323 |

Total | 114 | 12,475 |

The annual vote amounts to about Rs. 412,000.

There are about 170 masters and mistresses employed.

Of the pupils 73 per cent. are professedly Roman Catholics, 8 per cent. belong to the Church of England, the Hindus number 14 per cent., and the Mahomedans 5 per cent.

Currency.—All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is also the currency of the island.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Military Contribution.—Mauritius pays 40l. per head per annum for each infantry soldier stationed in the colony, and 70l. for engineers, artillerymen, staff, &c. The annual military contribution amounts to about 21,000l. a year.

Police.—The total police force on 31st December, 1884, was 679.

Sea Communications.—A four-weekly service is carried on by the mail steamers of the Messageries
Maritimes between New Caledonia and Marseilles, via Suez, touching at Mauritius, Réunion, and Seychelles. The same Company's steamers leave Marseilles every four weeks for New Caledonia, touching at Mauritius. The passage to and from Marseilles averages 21 days. This line receives a subsidy from the Mauritius Government. The Messageries Maritimes Company have also recently (1883) inaugurated a new monthly service of steamers between Mauritius, Réunion, Madagascar, the Comores Islands, Mozambique, and Zanzibar. A subsidy is also paid to the Donald Currie line of steamers, which keep up a monthly communication with England, via Natal, and the Cape of Good Hope. There is frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, Réunion, &c.

Commerce.

The foreign commerce of Mauritius extends to every quarter of the globe.

The chief exports are unrefined sugar, rum, &c.

The number of vessels that entered the harbour of Port Louis in 1884 was 593, with a total tonnage of 378,763 tons.

Dependencies.

The numerous dependencies of Mauritius comprise about a hundred islands scattered over the Indian Ocean, and contain a total population of 17,000 inhabitants. They may be roughly divided into four groups, the Seychelles Group, the Amirantes Group, the Oil islands and St. Brandon Group, and detached islands. The Amirantes Group lie between 4° 54' and 6° 13' S. lat., and 53° 27' and 53° 7' E. long. They are coral islands, producing cocoanut oil and a little maize, and some of them are used as fishing stations. The St. Brandon, or Cargados Islands, lie between 16° 20' and 16° 50' S. lat., and 59° 16' and 59° 41' E. long. Most of them are mere sandbanks, and their only produce is a little salt fish. The Chagos Islands, the Trois Frères or Eagle Islands, and the Cosmoledo Islands, which are known generally as the Oil Islands, lie between 6° 40' and 9° 40' S. lat. and 72° 22' and 47° 48' E. long. Amongst the detached islands may be named Assumption, the Aldebaran, and the Glorioso Islands, St. Paul Island, and Amsterdam Island, but none of these have any permanent population.

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the total number of acres comprised in this group is 50,120; the distance from Mauritius 940 miles. These islands are under the superintendence of a Chief Civil Commissioner (assisted by a Board of Commissioners) who is appointed by the Secretary of State, but is subordinate to the Governor of Mauritius, from whom he receives his instructions.

Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 4 miles broad. It rises abruptly from the sea, and its mountains, in some cases, reach the elevation of 2,000 feet. The capital of the island, now called Victoria, is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a commodious and safe harbour.

41 vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 64,989 tons, entered Port Victoria in 1884. The chief exports consist in coconut oil, vanilla, cloves, &c.

In the Seychelles group of islands are to be found the celebrated cocos-de-mer. With the leaves of the tree beautiful straw hats are made by the natives.

Rodrigues, the most important dependency of Mauritius after the Seychelles, is situated in latitude S. 19° 41' and longitude E. 63° 23', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a civil commissioner (who is also a police magistrate), who takes his instructions from the governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the governor of Mauritius in executive council. The population on 3rd April, 1881, was 1,436.

The island, which is mountainous and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good, sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla have all been tried.

During the time of slavery fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years this industry has been neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guinea fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard-apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmiste and vacoa trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and fruit.

Rodrigues was very serviceable to the British troops when Bourbon and Mauritius were taken from the French. The English troops were for a long time at the island; and again, later on, after the attack on Bourbon, the wounded were sent back there for recovery.

Diego Garcia, the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steam from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horse-shoe, and embracing between its extremities the three other minor islets. It is provided with a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end and from two to five miles in breadth.

Situated as Diego Garcia is, at 7° latitude S. and between 72° and 73° longitude east, on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin, it affords great convenience for coaling purposes to the steamers that cruise in those seas.

Large coal depôts have been established on the island by two commercial companies, and Diego Garcia is now frequently visited by steamers.

In 1885 the island was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius.

Further south, in the track of vessels from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia, lie the two rocky islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam, which are also dependencies of Mauritius.

Natal.

Discovery and Early History.

The Colony of Natal derives its name from the fact of its discovery by Vasco de Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas-day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about eight hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between 29th and 31st parallels of S. lat.; it is bounded by the Tugela and Umzimkulu Rivers, and by the Drakensberg Mountains. It comprises an area of about thirteen millions and a half of acres, and has a seaboard of one hundred and seventy miles. The country is broken and rugged, and transit is consequently difficult and costly. The scenery in Natal in parts is picturesque in the extreme; waterfalls abound. Natal is a well-watered country, no less than 23 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the one hundred and fifty miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco de Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The crew spent some twelve months there engaged in building a small vessel from the fragments of the wreck. Having accomplished their task, they sailed for the Cape, leaving behind them four Englishmen, three of whom were subsequently taken off by a Dutch ship which visited the coast. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Marines, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage endeavoured to colonize it. Though the British Government declined to recognize or aid him in his plans, he induced some twenty enterprising individuals to join him in this undertaking. On their arrival they placed themselves in relation with the king of the country Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country. He sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up at his death, about four years later.

Towards the close of the year 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to his brother Chaka. During the next two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with various success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a detachment of troops for the purpose. This detachment was shortly withdrawn, but after the lapse of a brief interval a second force, under Captain Smith, was sent (1840). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete, with whom a junction was effected. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

Constitution.

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In August, 1845, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. And in November of the same year other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, as well as an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1848, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, and from that time has not been under the control of the Governor of the Cape. Its affairs are administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, composed originally of four official members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and 12 members elected by the counties and boroughs.

By instructions received from the Secretary of State in 1858 the Chief Justice was added to the Executive Council, and, under the Supplementary Charter of December, 1869, two members of the Legislative Council are elected members of the Executive Council, whilst the number of official members of the Legislative and Executive Councils was increased to five by the admission of the Protector of Immigrants, for whom the Colonial Engineer has now been substituted by additional letters patent dated the 21st of December, 1876.

The elected members of Council hold their seats for four years from date of election, unless the Council is dissolved by the Governor. Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or is in receipt of rents from property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to £8 per month, or £96 per annum is entitled to a vote; the usual provisions respecting the disqualification of aliens, and others hold good. No person can be elected a member of Council, unless he is a duly qualified and registered elector, nor unless he shall have been invited to become a candidate for election by at
small band broken up at h.
Towards the of Dutch Room offence at r.
least 10 electors of the county or borough which it is proposed he shall represent; nor unless such requisition shall have been transmitted to the Resident Magistrate, at least fourteen days before the election. The Reserved Civil List is fixed at 40,100l. under the Supplementary Charter of 1872.

By Law No. 1 of 1873 the number of official members of the Legislative Council was increased to 5, and the number of elected members to 15. By Law No. 3 of 1875 the number of nominated members was increased to 13, including the 5 official members. By Law No. 1 of 1883 the number of official members is raised to 7 in all, and the number of elected members to 23.

Native Affairs.

In autumn 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amalubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, entered on a somewhat contumacious course of conduct towards the local government, ending in an attempt to escape from the Colony into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force, consisting of regulars, volunteers, and natives, was dispatched against the Tribe, and at one point, in the Bushman's River Pass, a portion of the force came into collision with the rear-guard of the tribe, when three European volunteers were shot down, and two natives. Langalibalele and many of the tribe were met and secured in Basutoland by Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Orpen, Agents of the Cape Government, and given up to the Natal force which was in pursuit. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under what is called "native law," the principal offenders being tried by a Court over which the Lieutenant-Governor himself presided. About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. The neighbouring tribe of Putini, which had harboured the women and cattle of the Amalubi Tribe, were subjected to similar confiscation, but the property of the Tribe has been restored to them. Langalibalele and his son were transported to Robben Island, in the Cape of Good Hope, by the Legislature of which Colony an Act was passed sanctioning their detention.

Her Majesty's Government having formed the opinion that the punishment inflicted on the Chief was excessive, this Act was repealed by the Cape Parliament, by a second Act which provided for the removal of Langalibalele and his son to the mainland to be at large under regulations framed by the Governor of the Cape in Council. The members of the tribe were practically amnestied and accorded liberty to settle peaceably in the Colony, though not to occupy their former location as a tribe.

The Langalibalele affair brought into prominence the system under which the native population had been managed by the Natal Government, and Sir Garnet Wolseley was specially commissioned to proceed to the Colony as administrator, and to consider and report upon the Native question, and the question of defence.

The Native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crimes mala in se.

The native population was debarred from the franchise, but by an Act No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law, in which case he would be entitled to all the rights of an ordinary Colonist. The tribes live apart, upon locations provided for them by the Government. They have enjoyed their tribal organisation, and lived in polygamy. But besides these location natives there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms.

It was decided, as a result of the recommendations of Sir Garnet Wolseley, and the deliberations of Her Majesty's Government, to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the Chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) has been passed establishing a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and by this law they are placed under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. A white magistrate is placed with every tribe, who is the administrator of justice in civil matters, and supersedes to a considerable extent the authority of the Chiefs; and it is hoped gradually to accustom the Kafirs to regular industry, and the individual ownership of property in the civilised way. By a law, No. 13 of 1875, a tax of 5l. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s.

The Zulu War.

In 1879 Natal, without being actually to any great extent the theatre of war, became the base of hostile operations against the Zulu kingdom, which were at the time of momentous interest to the Colonists, and are likely in their result to have a great influence on the future of the colony. It is not proposed here to do more than merely sketch in the slightest manner the causes which led to the Zulu war, and give the outline of its events. In the latter years of King Panda, Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons. This state of things appeared to be of such evil consequence to the general peace, that the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Panda's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen as heir, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetywayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. When this happened, Cetywayo sent messengers to the Natal Government, suggesting that Mr. Shepstone should come back into Zululand and crown him, or, by his presence, sanction his coronation as king, in fulfilment of the understanding arrived at in 1861. This the Natal Government consented that Mr. Shepstone should do, and Cetywayo was crowned by him in the presence of the Zulu people. As part of this solemn transaction, Cetywayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetywayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a ma-
terial change in the relations of the two powers took place. Cetywayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new government. The Zulu war party, with the prime minister at their head, wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone and Cetywayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being however by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported in June, 1878, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the lower Tugela Drift, and at the same time these representatives were put in possession of the demands on other subjects, which Sir Bartle Frere, after consultation with the local authorities, decided that the lieutenant-governor of Natal should make upon the Zulu king and people. The document containing these demands is called in the history of the war "the ultimatum."

In his award Sir B. Frere so far agreed with the report of the Natal Commissioners, as to give to the Zulus the political sovereignty of the disputed territory, which he held, upon the authorities before him, had never been validly ceded to the Transvaal Republic; but he made it part of the award that the farmers who had acquired farms in the disputed territory after 1861 should retain their farms.

The ultimatum demanded from Cetywayo the surrender of Umbelini, a Swazi refugee resident in Zululand, who had recently raided upon certain of his own tribe living near a place called Derby, under British protection; also the surrender of the sons and a brother of Sihayo, a chief living near the Tugela; the offence of these persons being that they had followed two of the wives of Sihayo into Natal, whither they had eloped, and dragged them back into Zululand over the bed of the Tugela, and then, as Methlakazulu, son of Sihayo, has since admitted, shot them. It further demanded a fine of 500 cattle from Cetywayo for not having surrendered the criminals when first demanded of him by Sir Henry Bulwer, and also a fine of 100 cattle for the conduct of certain common Zulus in surrounding and hustling two surveyors of the Royal Engineer Department when engaged upon some observations in the bed of the Tugela.

Besides these demands in respect of outrages, other requirements were made on Cetywayo in respect of the government of his country. These were that he should receive a British Resident; that he should allow missionaries to live securely in his country; that he should abolish his military system by which every man was a soldier belonging to one or other of the king's regiments, and liable to be called up to military service at the word of the king; that he should not go to war without the consent of his National Council and the British Resident; that he should observe his coronation promises against unjust killing, and that he should abolish the laws restricting marriage among his subjects.

Twenty days were given to him to comply with the first class of demands, and thirty days to comply with the second. The longer of these periods having elapsed, and the king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879, from the Utrecht district of the Transvaal, Rorke's Drift, and the Lower Tugela ford. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought: one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inyezane. In the first an impi of 18,000 Zulus attacked the camp of the Rorke's Drift column, which was defended by about half the column, the other half having proceeded with the general to what was intended to be the next camping ground. The camp transport ammunition and artillery were taken, and about 1,000 Europeans slain—less than 40 escaping over the Buffalo River at a place since called Fugitive's Drift. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, which was held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. (now Major) Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night, the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the engagement of Inyezane, Colonel Pearson, in command of the Lower Tugela column, defeated the enemy and occupied the hill mission station of Ekwowe, where he proceeded to entrench himself. The Rorke's Drift column, having lost its camp and transport, was compelled to evacuate Zululand, and take up a defensive position at Helpmakaar, in the colony.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. But even in this part British arms were not free from disaster. On the 12th of March a company of the 80th Regiment was surprised at the Intombi River, near Luneberg, by Umbelini, and nearly all killed; and on the 28th of March the cavalry and natives of Wood's column suffered a grievous loss in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but on the following day the whole Zulu army numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kamula Kop, suffered a defeat, which from their own testimony they seem to have regarded as the severest chastisement which they received in the course of the war.

At the beginning of April reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Ekwowe. His lordship defeated the enemy at Ginginhlou on the 3rd of April, and the same day relieved the garrison of Ekwowe, which place was then abandoned.

No general engagement was fought after this until the 4th of July, when the main army advancing upon Wool's original line of march from Utrecht, fought the battle of Ulundi, when the military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces. Cetywayo fled to the bush, with a few followers. The Zulu army never again assembled in force. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetywayo himself was captured on the 28th of August, by Major Marter of
the King's Dragoon Guards. On the 1st of September, Sir Garnet Wolseley, who had arrived at the end of June to take the supreme civil and military command in Natal and the Transvaal, assembled the chiefs of the Zulu nation at Ulundi, and explained to them the new order of things to be established in Zululand. The dynasty of Chaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent Chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him. The terms of the ultimatum in regard to matters of government were to be carried out; and a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

The main defect in this arrangement was the want of a recognised and paramount authority; and difficulties were soon experienced in its working. Some of the appointed chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise the authority of those placed over them. A large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetywayo, more than one deputation visiting the Natal Government to make known their wishes on the subject. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement, with a view to its being placed on a stable footing. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over a part of his former kingdom, subject to certain conditions, and to constitute the remainder of Zululand an independent native territory. The whole country north of the Umlatsoosi River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain, was restored to Cetywayo, and the territory between the Umlatsoosi and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner. It was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetywayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was re-installed by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable and more intractable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, a defeated exile, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death the Usutus finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers from the Transvaal and elsewhere, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who has been driven to take refuge in the Reserve. As a reward for this service they received a grant of nearly 3,000,000 acres of land, in which they have established a Republic, and taken all Zululand outside the Reserve under the protection of the new State. Dinizulu, Cetewayo's eldest son, has been proclaimed king in succession to his father.

On the 18th Dec., 1884, the British flag was hoisted at St. Lucia Bay, which was ceded to the English Government by Panda in 1843.

The Zulu Native Reserve is administered by a resident commissioner, who is immediately responsible to Sir H. Bulwer as H.M.'s special commissioner for Zulu affairs; and order is maintained by a force of seventy-five mounted native police, called the Reserve Territory Carabiners. The expenditure for 1883, amounting to £5,187., was met from a grant in aid from the Imperial exchequer, but the revenue received principally from the Hut Tax, of 10s. per hut, during 1884, has been sufficient to cover the expenditure, and it is expected that the territory will in future be self-supporting. The estimated revenue for 1884 was £6,750., and expenditure £6,474., including extraordinary expenditure, amounting to £450., on account of the disturbed state of the country.

The establishment of the Reserve is as follows:

Resident Commissioner, Melmoth Osborn, C.M.G., 1,000l.
Sub-Commissioner, A. L. Pretorius, 450l.
Lieut.-Col. Cardew, 82nd Reg. (acting).
Commandant of Carabiners, George Mansel, 600l.
Lieutenant of Carabiners, R. H. Addison, 300l.
