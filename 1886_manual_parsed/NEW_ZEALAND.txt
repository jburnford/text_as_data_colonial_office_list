TASMANIA.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass's Straits, 120 miles wide: the important gold-producing colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. The surface is diversified by ranges of hills and valleys, with occasionally large plains. Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian colonies.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1884 the mean heat of spring was 56°, summer 59°, autumn 51°, winter 48°, of the whole year 54°, which—compared with that of London, 51°; Edinburgh, 47°; Quebec, 41°; New York, 51°—shows a superiority of climate over those places. Rain fell on 171 days in the year, and the rainfall is a little more than 21 inches.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 1,313 miles of telegraph (with 1,716 miles of wire) open in the colony.

There is an electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to New South Wales, Queensland, Adelaide, and South Australia, the starting point of a line across the Australian continent to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The colony is placed in telegraph communication with New Zealand, via Sydney (New South Wales), by means of submarine cable.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Hobart and Launceston twice and sometimes thrice a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney every fortnight. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and New Zealand twice a month. There is also a steamer trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. Sailing vessels are continually departing from Hobart or Launceston to all the Australian colonies and New Zealand. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Galle and London every two weeks, time 42 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 60 days. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Singapore, and Galle every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 70 days. Sailing vessels of 600 to 700 tons direct to London in summer months. Clipper ships of heavy tonnage, as well as steamers of large power and tonnage, run between London and Melbourne all the year round, affording great facilities for communication between England and Tasmania.

There are 234 places in Tasmania where post offices are established.

There is no postage on newspapers to the United Kingdom, the other Australian colonies, or any part of Tasmania, when posted in the island.

The post office money order system is in force for orders on the Australian colonies, New Zealand, Great Britain and Ireland, India, and Germany, up to 10l. for each order.

The island contains 15½ million acres of land, and the islands connected with it contain 11 million acres: 4,403,888 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown; leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 12,374,112 acres, of which 1,778,977 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The colony—which is 170 miles from N. to S., and 160 from E. to W.—is divided into 18 counties. The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass Straits.

Besides the corporations of the city of Hobart and town of Launceston, there are twenty-one rural municipal councils in the colony, each with its warden and a sufficient police, and thirteen police districts.

Benevolent societies, working men's clubs, homes for the poor, asylums for the insane, hospitals for the sick, three asylums for paupers, reformatories, boys' home, town mission, Bible societies, temperance societies, Odd Fellows' Societies, Freemasons' lodges, gardeners' societies, and agricultural associations, have been established, and are in active operation.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in excellent order by the Government: all the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the treasury. In 1884 the maintenance of main roads cost 18,158l., of cross and bye roads 30,645l.

There are now 374 miles of railway in the colony, constructed mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. 257 miles of these are opened for traffic, and 117 miles in course of construction. The following is an abstract of the various lines:

| Open Lines. | Miles |
|-------------|-------|
| Hobart to Launceston (also with running powers over 11 miles of Government railways) | 123 |
| Launceston to Formby | 82 |
| Emu Bay to Waratah | 48 |
| Parattah to Oatlands | 4 |

| Under Construction. |
|---------------------|
| Fingal, corners to St. Mary's | 46 |
| Bridgewater to Geomora | 24 |
| Launceston to Scottsdale | 47 |

374

The first of the above lines is worked by an English Company; the colony guaranteeing to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on a sum not exceeding 650,000l. for 30 years upon due fulfilment of the contract and maintenance of the line during that period.

There is also a railway from the port of Launceston to Deloraine, 45 miles in length, passing through some of the best agricultural lands of the colony. It cost 510,000l., and it is about to be extended from Deloraine to Formby, on the north-west coast. Besides the railway above mentioned, there are about 20 miles in course of construction, making the total of Tasmanian railways 374 miles.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; and the upset price of pastoral lands a sum equal to 12 years' rental, but not less than 5s. an acre.

Any person may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricul-
tural land not exceeding 320 acres, at 1l. an acre, on the following terms, as exemplified to the extent of 100 acres:

| Acres | £  | s. | d. |
|-------|----|----|----|
| 100   | 100| 0  | 0  |
| Add one-third for credit | 33 | 6  | 8  |

£133 6 8

Cash at time of purchase . . . . 3 6 8
Ditto first year . . . . 5 0 0
Ditto second year . . . . 5 0 0
Ditto third and following years up to 14 years . . . . 10 0 0 a yr.

And so on in proportion for any greater or smaller area than 100 acres.

When 500 acres shall have been sold in not less than 10 lots adjoining or close to each other, the Governor in Council is empowered to raise a sum not exceeding half of such purchase money for the purpose of constructing a road or roads in the vicinity of the lots.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l. The various islands belonging to Tasmania may be leased for 14 years by rent payable in advance for each year.

The Immigration Act also empowers the Immigration Board to permit any person, who has paid his family's passage-money as a "cabin" or intermediate passenger, to demand, within a year after his arrival in the colony, a certificate to select 30 acres of land for himself, 20 for his wife, and 10 for each child accompanying him or joining him within twelve months.

And for these lands a grant will issue after five years' residence within the colony; but the order will not be forfeited by the death of the emigrant if his family remain.

The Emigration and Colonists' Aid Corporation, 25, Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, London, is the agency now employed by the Tasmanian Board of Immigration, to whom all enquiries for information respecting the Colony should be addressed.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, hides, skins, and leather, hops, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark. The value of tin and gold exported in 1884 was—tin, 301,423l.; gold, 132,010l.

The land in cultivation in 1884 was 425,845 acres. There were in the colony 128,834 horned cattle and 1,720,027 sheep. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1884 was 8,215,101 lb., valued at 453,567l.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, some of which are now being turned to account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, and iron of the finest quality has been produced from them. Tin in immense quantities has been discovered at Mount Bischoff, the whole mountain being said to be intersected with veins of that ore. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. There exists in the island an enormous lode of bismuth, said to be the richest in the world. Copper, silver, and antimony have also been found, the copper yielding 30 per cent. of metal. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

In the elevated plateau which occupies the centre of the island are numerous lakes, which by means of irrigation might be made to spread fertility over a large surface, and furnish rich pasture land for stock.

In these various ways profitable employment might be found for a large amount of capital and labour, and Tasmania might become one of the most prosperous and agreeable of the Australasian colonies.

The want of labour is seriously felt, in consequence of the drain upon it by the mines. Farm and other labourers, and female domestic servants, are in great request, as well as miners and artizans.

Census.

On 3rd April, 1881, the population of Tasmania was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females. The death-rate of 1881 was 14.77 to the 1,000 of the population, but for 1868-73 it was only 14 per 1,000. The number of inhabited houses is 21,858. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds, many of whom are descended from them.

Numerous churches and chapels are erected in various parts; and in addition to private schools, there are 191 Government schools, having 14,846 scholars on the rolls; and several scholarships are maintained by the colony, the best being the two annual Tasmanian scholarships, of 20l. a year each, tenable at an English university for four years. There are also 17 yearly exhibitions from primary to superior schools, each tenable for four years, varying from 16l. to 20l. a year.

There were 31,080 persons, or 26.86 per cent., in Tasmania who could not read, according to the census, on 3rd of April, 1881, of whom 15,889 were under 5 years old.

Hobart is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1885) within the Registration boundary 30,748 inhabitants and 38 places of worship. The city has been much improved of late years by the addition of several handsome public buildings.

Launceston, the second town of the colony, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 18,854 persons, and is rapidly progressing.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17): by this Act a Legislative Council and House of Assembly are constituted, called "the Parliament of Tasmania."

The Legislative Council consists of sixteen members, elected for thirteen electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 20l. or leasehold of 80l. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-two members, elected for the same number of electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court. The duration of the Assembly is five years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to have his name included in the assessment roll of the district for which his vote is to be
given as the owner or occupier of any property, or to be in receipt of income of 60l. sterling per year, for 6 months prior to 1st November in any year. House allowances or rations to be regarded as income according to certain scale. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict., No. 32.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

TRINIDAD.

The island of Trinidad lies to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° W. longitude from Greenwich. Its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1496; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the king of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island.

Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere, by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the great preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The fleet was under the command of Rear-Admiral Harvey, and consisted of 18 vessels, carrying 760 guns. The military force, numbering in all 6,750 rank and file, was led by Sir Ralph Abercrombie.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 16th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Abercrombie, Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish governor.

Trinidad was held for a few years as a military conquest, during which period it was governed by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton, Aide-de-Camp to Sir Ralph Abercrombie.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

General Description.

The soil is varied, and extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. Coffee has of late been largely cultivated, and with great success, bidding fair to become a very considerable factor in the future exporting power of the colony. Tobacco of a superior quality is also largely grown.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the past nineteen years has been 66·39 inches. The mean temperature during the same period was lowest at 76°·1 Fahr. in January, and highest at 79° Fahr. in September and October respectively.

The chief town and principal port of Trinidad
is Port of Spain (population 31,858), situated on a gently inclined plain, near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population 6,335), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

The harbour is the finest in the West Indies. A pitch lake, 90 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value, and yields a slight revenue to the island.

Of the total area of Trinidad, which is estimated at about 1,123,000 acres, the alienated acreage is given below, according to the last assessment:

| Cultivated in Sugar Cane | 52,163 |
|--------------------------|--------|
| " Cacao and Coffee       | 25,188 |
| " Ground Provisions      | 18,053 |
| " Coconuts               | 2,767  |
| Total in crop            | 98,171 |
| Pasture                  | 6,242  |
| Uncultivated             | 190,997|
| Total alienated          | 295,410|

The population of the island was ascertained by the Census of 1881 to be 153,128.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers which ply daily, calling at intermediate points, and by the newly opened railway. The Gulf steamers proceed on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

Railways.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Clayton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, and the further extension to San Fernando (7 miles), was opened on the 17th April, 1882. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways, between San Fernando and Savana Grande, and as hort line at Chaguanas, used chiefly for the conveyance of sugar. These lines will no doubt become of greater importance when united with the main line.

The Guaracara Valley Extension Railway from San Fernand to Princes Town was opened in 1884.

Municipalities.

The towns of Port of Spain and San Fernando are under the jurisdiction of borough councils, the former consisting of fifteen elective members, the latter of seven.

One of the members is annually chosen mayor.

Postal Communications.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and 27 cut offices throughout the island.

The money order system has been established between the United Kingdom and the island and the neighbouring colonies, and orders are issued at the General Post Office and at the San Fernando office.

Trinidad has joined the Postal Union.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad has within the last few years increased considerably, the number per month being now 17, viz., 4 royal mail steamers, 2 royal mail cargo steamers, 2 of the steamers of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, 2 of the West India and Pacific Line, one of the Harrison Line, and 1 of Joseph Hoult's Line, from Liverpool; 4 of the London Direct Line steamers, 1 Clyde steamer, 2 of the Quebec and Gulf Line, and 3 of the Atlantic and West India Line from America, and 4 steamers running between the island and Venezuela. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers.

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head 41,526l. was expended in 1883, besides the fixed establishment of the department, the cost of which is about 3,350l. The number of Indian immigrants during each of the last three years was as follows:
