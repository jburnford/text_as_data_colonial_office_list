VICTORIA R.

WHEREAS We, taking into Our Royal Consideration that there exists no means of adequately rewarding the individual gallant services either of Officers of the lower grades in Our Naval and Military Service, or of Warrant and Petty Officers, Seamen, and Marines in Our Navy, and Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers in Our Army; and whereas the Third Class of Our Most Honorable Order of the Bath is limited, except in very rare cases, to the higher ranks of both Services, and the granting of medals, both in Our Navy and Army, is only awarded for long service or meritorious conduct, rather than for bravery in action or distinction before an enemy, such cases alone excepted where a general medal is granted for a particular action or campaign, or a clasp added to the medal for some especial encouragement, in both of which cases all share equally in the boon, and those who by their valour have particularly signalized themselves remain undistinguished from their comrades: Now, for the purpose of attaining an end so desirable as that of rewarding individual instances of merit and valour, We have instituted and created and by these Presents, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, institute and create a New Naval and Military Decoration, which we are desirous should be highly prized and eagerly sought
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

after by the Officers and Men of Our Naval and Military Services, and are graciously pleased to make ordain, and establish the following rules and ordinances for the government of the same, which shall from henceforth be inviolably observed and kept:

Firstly. It is ordained, that the distinction shall be styled and designated "the Victoria Cross," and shall consist of a Maltese Cross of Bronze, with Our Royal Crest in the centre, and underneath which an escroll bearing this inscription, "For Valour."

Secondly. It is ordained, that the Cross shall be suspended from the left breast, by a blue ribbon for the Navy, and by a red ribbon for the Army.

Thirdly. It is ordained, that the names of those upon whom We may be pleased to confer the Decoration shall be published in the "London Gazette," and a registry thereof kept in the office of Our Secretary of State for War.

Fourthly. It is ordained, that any one who, after having received the Cross, shall again perform an act of bravery, which, if he had not received such Cross, would have entitled him to it, such further act shall be recorded by a Bar attached to the ribbon by which the Cross is suspended, and for every additional act of bravery an additional Bar may be added.

Fifthly. It is ordained, that the Cross shall only be awarded to those Officers or men who have served Us in the presence of the enemy, and shall have then performed some signal act of valour or devotion to their country.

Sixthly. It is ordained, with a view to place all persons on a perfectly equal footing in relation to eligibility for the Decoration, that neither rank, nor long service, nor wounds, nor any other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of conspicuous bravery, shall be held to establish a sufficient claim to the honour.

Seventhly. It is ordained, that the Decoration may be conferred on the spot where the act to be rewarded by the grant of such Decoration has been performed, under the following circumstances:

I. When the Fleet or Army in which such act has been performed is under the eye and command of an Admiral or General Officer commanding the Forces.

II. Where the Naval or Military force is under the eye and command of an Admiral or Commodore commanding a squadron or detached naval force, or of a General commanding a corps, or division, or brigade on a distinct and detached service, when such Admiral, Commodore, or General Officer shall have the power of conferring the Decoration on the spot, subject to confirmation by Us.

Eighthly. It is ordained, where such act shall not have been performed in sight of a Commanding Officer as aforesaid, then the claimant for the honour shall prove the act to the satisfaction of the Captain or Officer commanding his ship, or to the Officer commanding the regiment to which the claimant belongs, and such Captain or such Commanding Officer shall report the same through the usual channel to the Admiral or Commodore commanding the force employed on the service, or to the Officer commanding the forces in the field, who shall call for such description and attestation of the act as he may think requisite, and on approval shall recommend the grant of the Decoration.

Ninthly. It is ordained, that every person selected for the Cross, under rule seven, shall be publicly decorated before the Naval or Military force or body to which he belongs, and with which the act of bravery for which he is to be rewarded shall have been performed, and his name shall be recorded in a General Order, together with the cause of his especial distinction.

Tenthly. It is ordained, that every person selected under rule eight shall receive his Decoration as soon as possible, and his name shall likewise appear in a General Order as above required, such General Order to be issued by the Naval or Military Commander of the Forces employed on the service.

Eleventhly. It is ordained, that the General Orders above referred to shall from time to time be transmitted to Our Secretary of State for War, to be laid before Us, and shall be by him registered.

Twelfthly. It is ordained, that as cases may arise not falling within the rules above specified, or in which a claim, though well founded, may not have been established on the spot, We will, on the joint submission of Our Secretary of State for War and of Our Commander-in-Chief of Our Army, or on that of Our Lord High Admiral or Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in the case of the Navy, confer the Decoration, but never without conclusive proof of the performance of the act of bravery for which the claim is made.

Thirteenthly. It is ordained, that in the event of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, a detached body of Seamen and Marines, not under fifty in number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop, or company, in which the Admiral, General, or other Officer commanding such forces, may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that no special selection can be made by them: then in such case the Admiral, General, or other Officer commanding, may direct, that for any such body of Seamen or Marines, or for every troop or company of Soldiers, one Officer shall be selected by the Officers engaged for the Decoration; and in like manner one Petty Officer or Non-commissioned Officer shall be selected by the Petty Officers and Non-commissioned Officers engaged; and two Seamen or Private Soldiers or Marines shall be selected by the Seamen, or Private Soldiers, or Marines, engaged respectively, for the Decoration; and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the Senior Officer in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment, troop, or company, to the Admiral or General Officer commanding, who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts were done under his own eye.

Fourteenthly. It is ordained, that every Warrant Officer, Petty Officer, Seaman, or Marine, or Non-commissioned Officer or Soldier, who shall have received the Cross, shall, from the date of the act by which the Decoration has been gained, be entitled to a Special Pension of Ten Pounds a year, and each additional Bar conferred under rule four on such Warrant or Petty Officers, or Non-commissioned Officers or Men, shall carry with it an Additional Pension of Five Pounds per annum.

Fifteenthly. In order to make such additional provision as shall effectually preserve pure this most honourable distinction it is ordained, that if any person on whom such distinction shall be conferred be convicted of treason, cowardice, felony, or of any infamous crime, or if he be accused of any such offence, and doth not after a reasonable time surrender himself to be tried for the same, his name shall
forthwith be erased from the registry of individuals upon whom the said Decoration shall have been conferred, by an especial Warrant under Our Royal Sign Manual, and the Pension conferred under rule fourteen shall cease and determine from the Date of such Warrant. It is hereby further declared that We, Our Heirs and successors, shall be the sole judges of the circumstance demanding such expulsion; moreover We shall at all times have power to restore such persons as may at any time have been expelled, both to the enjoyment of the Decoration and Pensions.

Given at Our Court at Buckingham Palace, this twenty-ninth of January, in the nineteenth year of Our Reign, and in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six.

WARRANT for extending the VICTORIA CROSS to the LOCAL FORCES in NEW ZEALAND and in the COLONIES and their DEPENDENCIES generally.

VICTORIA R.

VICTORIA, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith. To all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting:

WHEREAS, by a Warrant under Our Royal Sign Manual, countersigned by one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, and bearing date, at Our Court at Buckingham Palace, the 29th day of January, 1856, in the nineteenth year of Our Reign, We did constitute and create a new Naval and Military Decoration, to be styled and designated the Victoria Cross, which Decoration We expressed our desire should be highly prized and eagerly sought after by the Officers and Men of Our Naval and Military Services, and did also make, ordain, and establish the Rules and Ordinances therein set forth for the government of the same, to be thenceforth inviolably observed and kept;

And whereas during the progress of the operations which We have undertaken against the Insurgent Native Tribes in Our Colony of New Zealand it has happened that persons serving in the Local Forces of Our said Colony have performed deeds of gallantry, in consideration of which they are not, according to the strict provisions of Our said recited Warrant, eligible for this high distinction:

Now know ye, that We of Our especial Grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, have thought fit hereby to signify Our Royal Will and Pleasure that the said Decoration may be conferred on such persons aforesaid, who may be qualified to receive the same in accordance with the Rules and Ordinances made, ordained, and established by Us for the government thereof, by Our said recited Warrant, and We do by these Presents, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, ordain and appoint that it shall be competent for such persons aforesaid to obtain the said Decoration in the manner set forth in the Rules and Ordinances referred to, or in accordance with such further Rules and Ordinances as may hereafter be made and promulgated by Us, Our Heirs and Successors, for the government of the said Decoration; provided that it be established in any case that the person was serving with Our Troops, under the Orders of a General or other Officer, under circumstances which would entitle an Officer or Soldier of Our Army to be recommended for the said Decoration, in accordance with the Rules and Ordinances prescribed in Our said recited Warrant, and provided also such person shall be recommended for it by such General or other Officer:

And We do further, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, ordain and appoint that the said Decoration may also be conferred, in accordance with the Rules and Ordinances prescribed in Our said recited Warrant, and subject to the provisions aforesaid, on such persons who may be qualified to receive the same in accordance with the said Rules and Ordinances as may hereafter be employed in the Local Forces raised or which may be raised in Our Colonies and their Dependencies, who may be called upon to serve in co-operation with Our Troops in military operations which it may be necessary to undertake for the suppression of Rebellion against Our Authority, or for repelling invasion by a foreign enemy.

Given at Our Court, at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, this First day of January, 1867, in the thirtieth year of Our Reign.

By Her Majesty's Command,

7. (Page 315.)

THE QUEEN has been pleased to direct that the following REGULATIONS respecting FOREIGN ORDERS and MEDALS shall be substituted for those now in force:—

Regulations respecting Foreign Orders.

1. No subject of Her Majesty shall accept a Foreign Order from the Sovereign of any foreign country, or wear the insignia thereof, without having previously obtained Her Majesty's permission to that effect, signified by a warrant under Her Royal Sign Manual.

2. Excepting in the case of Special Complimentary Missions to Foreign Sovereigns, such permission shall not be granted to any subject of Her Majesty unless the Foreign Order shall have been conferred in consequence of active and distinguished service before the enemy, either at sea or in the field; or unless he shall have been actually and entirely employed, beyond Her Majesty's dominions, in the service of the Foreign Sovereign by whom the Order is conferred.

3. The intention of a Foreign Sovereign to confer upon a British subject the insignia of an Order must be notified to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, either through the British Minister accredited to the Court of such Foreign Sovereign, or through his Minister accredited at the Court of Her Majesty.

4. If the service for which it is proposed to confer the Order has been performed during war, the notification required by the preceding clause must be made not later than two years after the exchange of the Ratifications of a Treaty of Peace.

If the service has been performed in time of peace, the notification must be made within two years after the date of such service.
5. After such notification shall have been received, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shall, if the case comes within the conditions prescribed by the present Regulations, and arises from naval or military services before the enemy, refer it to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the War Department previously to taking Her Majesty's pleasure thereupon, in order to ascertain whether there be any objection to Her Majesty's permission being granted.

A similar reference shall also be made to the Commander-in-Chief if the application relates to an officer in the army, or to the Lords of the Admiralty if it relates to an officer in the navy.

6. When Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shall have taken the Queen's pleasure on any such application, and shall have obtained Her Majesty's permission for the person in whose favour it has been made to accept the Foreign Order and wear the insignia thereof, he shall signify the same to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, in order that he may cause the warrant required by clause 1 to be prepared for the Royal Sign Manual.

When such warrant shall have been signed by the Queen a notification thereof shall be inserted in the "Gazette," stating the service for which the Foreign Order has been conferred.

7. The warrant signifying Her Majesty's permission may, at the request and at the expense of the person who has obtained it, be registered in the College of Arms.

8. Every such warrant as aforesaid shall contain a clause providing that Her Majesty's license and permission does not authorize the assumption of any style, appellation, rank, precedence, or privilege appertaining to a Knight Bachelor of Her Majesty's realms.

9. When a British subject has received the Royal permission to accept a Foreign Order, he will at any future time be allowed to accept the decoration of a higher class of the same Order to which he may have become eligible by increase of rank in the foreign service or in the service of his own country, or any other distinctive mark of honour strictly consequent upon the acceptance of the original order, and common to every person upon whom such Order is conferred.

10. The preceding clause shall not be taken to apply to decorations of the Guelphic Order which were bestowed on British subjects by Her Majesty's predecessors King George IV. and King William IV., on whose heads the crowns of Great Britain and of Hanover were united.

Decorations so bestowed cannot properly be considered as rewards granted by a Foreign Sovereign for services rendered according to the purport of clause 2 of these Regulations. They must be rather considered as personal favours bestowed on British subjects by British Sovereigns, and as having no reference to services rendered to the Foreign Crown of Hanover.

Foreign Office, February 3, 1886.

Regulations respecting Foreign Medals.

1. Applications for permission to accept and wear Medals which, not being the decoration of any Foreign Order, are conferred by a Foreign Sovereign on British subjects in the army or navy, should be addressed to the Commander-in-Chief or the Lords of the Admiralty, as the case may be, who, if they see fit, may submit the same for Her Majesty's sanction; upon obtaining which they may grant such permission without other formality.

2. Any other British subject, having obtained Her Majesty's permission, is at liberty to accept and wear a Foreign Medal, not being the Decoration of a Foreign Order.

3. No permission is necessary for accepting a Foreign Medal, if such Medal is not to be worn.

ENGROSSING AND ENROLLING OF BILLS.

"Die Jovis, 8th Februarii, 1849.

Resolved, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled,—
1. That it is expedient to discontinue the present system of Engrossing, and to alter the present system of Enrolling Bills, and to make such provisions in lieu thereof as are hereinafter mentioned.
2. That this House is prepared to agree to the following arrangements, if agreed to by the other House of Parliament."

I. That in lieu of being engrossed, every Bill shall be fair printed immediately after it shall have been passed in the House in which it originated, and that such fair printed Bill shall be sent to the other House, as the Bill so passed, and shall (subject to the regulation next hereinafter mentioned) be dealt with by that House and its Officers, in the same manner in which Engrossed Bills are now dealt with.

II. That on its Return to the House in which it originated, without Amendments (or if amended, after the Amendments shall have been settled and agreed to), it shall be fair printed by the Queen's Printer, who shall furnish a fair print thereof on vellum to the House of Lords, before the Royal Assent, and likewise a duplicate of such fair print, also on vellum.

III. That one of such fair prints of each Bill shall be duly authenticated by the proper Officers of each House, as the Bill to which both Houses have agreed.

IV. That the Royal Assent shall be endorsed in the usual form on such fair print so authenticated which shall be deposited in the Record Tower, in lieu of the present Engrossment.

V. That the Copies promulgated in the first instance by the Queen's Printer, shall be impressions from the same form as the deposited copy.

VI. That the Master of the Rolls shall, upon being duly authorised in that behalf, receive in lieu of the Copies of Public General Acts as new enrolled, the hereinbefore mentioned duplicate fair print of each Public General Bill, to be held for the same purpose, and subject to the same conditions for and upon which the Enrolled Acts are now received and held by him.

VII. That it is expedient, with a view to economy, convenience, and despatch, and to the diminutions of the chance of errors, that one Printer should print the Public General Bills for both Houses; and that inasmuch as the Queen's Printer is by virtue of his office bound to print the Acts, it would be advisable for the attainment of the before-mentioned objects, that the Queen's Printer should be employed by both Houses to print the Public General Bills.
