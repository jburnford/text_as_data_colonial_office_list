Defence.

A volunteer corps was established in 1879, having 170 members in Port of Spain. There is also a Rifle Association.

The Police Force of the island consists of an inspector-commandant, two inspectors, one clerk, two sergeant-majors, 80 sergeants, 25 corporals, 25 lance corporals, and 320 constables. There is also a water police, with 2 coxswains and 8 policemen. The cost of the establishment is 28,285l. annually.

Education.

Education has made considerable progress in Trinidad for some years past. The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, aided only by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, the College of the Immaculate Conception. Attached to these institutions are exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of 150l., each tenable for three years at some university in Great Britain or Ireland. Four of these exhibitions may be gained annually by such students of either College as pass the required examination. There were at the end of 1884 sixty students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and one hundred and sixty-seven on those of the College of the Immaculate Conception.

From the Government primary schools to the Queen's Royal College there are annually open to competition three free admissions, each tenable for three years.

The primary schools are now one hundred and eight in number, fifty of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and fifty-eight denominational and assisted. The Government schools are generally well supplied with school requisites; their furniture is constructed on good models, and some of them are held in creditable buildings. Fees are exacted and paid with great regularity, the usual rates being three pence per head per week; at some schools the charge is two shillings per month, and at the Model Schools five shillings per month. There is a reduction when the fees are paid quarterly in advance, and reduced rates are charged for the second and third children in a family. In connexion with the Boys' Model School there is a Training College for male teachers, which admits twelve resident and seven non-resident...
students. The staff of the Government schools includes 46 masters, 7 mistresses, 5 assistant masters, 66 assistant and work mistresses, and 70 pupil teachers, paid monitors, and normal students. There is an examination of teachers annually, the conditions of which are similar to those in force in England.

The number of pupils attending the primary schools was as follows:

| Year | Government Schools | Assisted Schools | Total |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1880 | 4,446             | 3,808           | 8,254 |
| 1881 | 4,171             | 4,828           | 9,000 |
| 1882 | 3,650             | 4,273           | 7,991 |
| 1883 | 4,449             | 4,734           | 9,183 |
| 1884 | 3,904             | 5,182           | 9,086 |

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private adventure schools, the largest of which is the Couvent Boarding and Day School for girls. Under the Presbyterian Coolie Mission there are twenty-four estate schools, having about 758 pupils; so that it may be roughly estimated that the number of children attending school in Trinidad is about 10,000.

Government.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an executive council of three members. The legislative body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 6 official, and 8 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.

Tariff.

The Customs Tariff is as follows:

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

These islands were formerly included, for purposes of government, among the Bahama group, from which they were separated in 1848 by Act of the Bahama Legislature. The following is an extract from that Act:—“The Islands of Grand and Salt Cay, together with the small islands and Cays immediately adjacent thereto, and which, together with the said Islands of Grand and Salt Cay, are commonly known and designated as ‘The Turks Islands,’ and the Islands and Cays, commonly known and designated as the ‘Caicos Islands,’ together with all the banks and Cays situate, lying, and being to the eastward of the said Turks’ Islands and Caicos Islands, and comprised within, or deemed part of, or appertaining to Your Majesty’s Bahama Islands, shall cease to be component parts of the Bahama Government,” &c.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. The area of these islands is 169 square miles.

On the 1st of January, 1874, this Colony was
annexed to Jamaica, by Order in Council, under an Imperial Act, 36 Vict., cap. 6. There is a Legislative Board consisting of the Chief Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure, and other matters of a purely local character, are regulated by this Board; but all laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica, which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands, take effect there.

VICTORIA.

Position.

Victoria, the most populous of the Australasian colonies, is situated at the south-east of the Continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its exact coast line is nearly 700 miles.

Victoria was separated from New South Wales
in 1851. It is bounded on the west by the Colony of South Australia, the dividing line being the 141st meridian. On the north and north-east it is bounded by the Colony of New South Wales, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass's Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and in the whole of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in lat. 39° 8' S., long. 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the colony meets the Murray, lat. 34° 2' S., long. 141° E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in lat. 37° 31' S., long. 149° 59' E.; the most westerly part is the whole western frontier, which lies upon the meridian 141° E. (as has been already stated), and extends from lat. 34° 2' S. to lat. 38° 4' S., or about 280 miles.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 570 miles, and by land 554 miles; from Adelaide by sea 482 miles, and by land 575 miles. Sydney and Melbourne are now connected by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained fortnightly by the subsidized steamers of the P. and O. Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Orient, Pacific, British India, and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

Area.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres. The whole continent of Australia contains 2,944,628 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface. Great Britain, exclusive of the islands in the British seas, contains 88,140 square miles, and is therefore slightly larger than Victoria.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57° 6°; the mean atmospheric pressure at 91.3 feet above the sea level was 29.93 inches; rain falls on the average upon 136 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25.65 inches.

Industry.

Wheat produced in Victoria, in 1884-85, was 10,433,136 bushels; oats, 4,392,695 bushels; potatoes, 161,119 tons; hay, 371,046 tons. The Victorian wool produced in 1883 amounted to about 65,330,000 lbs., valued at 4,148,300l.

The total quantity of gold raised from the date of the first discovery (1851) to the end of the year 1884, is estimated at 52,992,768 ozs., which at 4l. per oz. gives the value as 211,971,072l.

The number of acres under cultivation in 1884-85 was 2,323,493.

According to the returns of 1884-5, there are 293,846 horses in the colony; 1,287,945 horned cattle; 10,637,412 sheep; and 234,347 pigs.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The manufactories and works returned in 1883 numbered 2,612, the hands employed therein numbered 45,698; and the capital invested, so far as it is represented by the value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant, amounted to 8,519,486l.

There are 1,663 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation; also 39 miles in course of construction.

There are 4,020 miles of telegraph lines open, and 8,055 miles of wire.

Stage-coaches run to all parts of the Colony where railway communication is not available.

Melbourne, the capital, is the most populous city in Australasia, having, with its suburbs, in 1885, an estimated population of 325,000. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Ministry. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 42 members elected for fourteen Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 86 members returned by 55 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

One of the Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council. The property qualification of Members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 100l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 25l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of Members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is under ordinary circumstances three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856.

All Members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The Members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipal bodies are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 83,147 square miles, or nineteen-twentieths of the whole Colony. Each district is a body cor-
porate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the Members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the £ (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1884 there were 60 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 120 shires. The number of ratepayers was 226,060; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 8,098,814l., representing a value in fee simple of 103,795,832l.; the total income (including 372,202l. received from Government) was 1,129,168l., and the expenditure was 1,211,209l.
