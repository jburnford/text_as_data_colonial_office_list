JAMAICA.

An island situated in the Caribbean Sea, and to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 43' and 18° 32', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 20'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,913 square miles. There were 198 sugar estates in operation.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 10' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 30' and 80° 35' W. long., are appendages of Jamaica. The largest of the islands, Grand Cayman, contains about 2,000 inhabitants, who as well as the inhabitants of the other two, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are mainly engaged in catching turtle for export.

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,683,520 acres, from which may be deducted 365,828 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,317,692 acres available for cultivation. Of this 592,405 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1844.

Jamaica was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. After the capture of the island, until the Restoration of Charles II, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction. In 1660 the first establishment of a regular civil government was made by Charles II, who appointed G. D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid. In 1807 the Slave Trade was abolished, at which time there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received £6,161,927, of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners; being rather more than 19l. a head on a slave population of 309,338.

Climate.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is about 80°, rising to 90° in the daytime, and falling to 70° at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, and as there is a lofty range of mountains which run down the middle of the whole island, it is...
possible, in a few hours, to reach a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

In the country the difference of temperature between day and night is seldom more than 10°, but the difference of temperature in summer and winter is much less, say 5° or 6°.

During this century Jamaica was tolerably free from hurricanes and earthquakes, until the 18th August, 1880, when the effects of a cyclone were felt in the north and north-eastern portions of the island.

The rainy seasons are in May and October, and last for about three weeks; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by occasional showers. The annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 30 inches to as much as 180 inches.

**Constitution.**

The Constitution, which, after existing for nearly 50 years in Jamaica, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The abolition of the form of government, and the substitution for it of a new form, resulted from the serious disturbances amongst the black population which occurred in October, 1865.

After the suppression of disaffection in St. Thomas-in-the-East, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then-existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong government might be created.

The Legislature unanimously responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute another form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

An Act of the Imperial Parliament and an Order in Council of the 9th April, 1866, were passed providing a new Constitution for Jamaica, as follows:

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881. One or more persons to act provisionally as unofficial. The Governor sat as President. The official members, by virtue of their offices, were the Senior Military Officer, the Secretary, and the Attorney-General.

Her Majesty, by Order in Council dated the 16th May, 1884, was pleased further to alter the constitution of the Legislative Council in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor and four other members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Director of Public Works, and such other persons not exceeding five in number as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint and nine persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved. The first general election was completed on the 12th September, 1884, and the Council met on the 30th idem.

There is also a Privy Council, consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General, and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of Her Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum. The Governor is to consult in all cases with the Councilors, excepting only when the case is of such a nature that this service would in his judgment sustain material prejudice by consultation, or when the matters to be decided are too unimportant to require their advice, or too urgent to admit of the necessary delay; and he is to propose all questions on which they are to advise and decide; but any member may apply in writing for permission to propose a question, and the member may record upon the minutes his written application and the Governor's answer. The Governor is authorised to act in opposition to the advice and decision of the Privy Council, "if in any case it shall appear right so to do," and he must report to the Secretary of State for the Colonies "the grounds and reasons" of his opposition, and any member may record on the minutes the nature of the advice or opinion brought under the consideration of the Privy Council.

In the Legislative Council, any member may propose questions for debate, excepting only that no law shall be enacted, nor any vote or resolution passed, nor any question admitted to debate, when the object is to dispose of or charge any part of the revenue, unless the proposition be made by the Governor, or the proposal expressly allowed or directed by him. All laws passed are to be styled, "Laws enacted by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council of the Island of Jamaica."

**Statistics, &c.**

For many years prior to the establishment of Crown Government, in 1866, the expenditure of the island exceeded the revenue by large amounts; but a better collection of the imposts, and the increase of the community in numbers and substance, has permitted a large increase of revenue and a considerable reduction of debt. The total general and local revenues of Jamaica amount to about 20s. a head of the population, but this calculation includes local rates, railway telegraph and postal receipts, and reimbursements. The customs tariff and the excise produce respectively 6s. 6d. and 2s. 4d. a head of the population. The taxes on land are almost nominal, yielding only about 12,000l.

The number of parishes (which are the units of local government) has been reduced from 22 to 14. Each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., almshouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are, under a law of 1885, elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The several direct taxes received on land, houses, horses, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected. The revenue is collected by the officers of the Revenue Department, with a collector in each parish at the head of a branch office. The principal sums are derived from import duties, which yield about 250,000l.; excise duty on rum, at 5s. per gallon, yielding 86,000l.; stamps, 15,500l.; licenses, 16,000l.; and postal revenue, 16,500l. The new railway receipts, estimated at 47,300l. for 1885-86, and reimbursements 20,000l., swell the total of revenue.
There is a regular postal service three times a-week to and from all parts of the island, and a daily one to some limited parts. The rate for letters by the tri-weekly post is 2d. per ½ oz.; but to those places with which there is daily communication the rate is 1d. per ½ oz.

Government savings banks were established in 1871, in all the principal towns, and there is now deposited about £30,000l., on which the rate of interest has, from 1st April, 1881, been reduced from 4 to 3 per cent., with the result of a very inconsiderable withdrawal of deposits. The deposits, with the exception of a working balance, are invested in home and colonial securities, and the institution is thus self-supporting.

District courts, somewhat on the model of County Courts in England, are held all over the island. The judges are barristers or advocates.

The constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are 18 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 693 sub-officers and men, distributed throughout the island.

An "island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons. For attending East Indian immigrants, vaccination, &c., &c., they are paid extra. They are not restricted in private practice, and at the same time are allowed the privileges of pension after twenty years' service, and six months' leave of absence on half-pay after six years' service.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail contract steamers leave Southampton on every alternate Thursday throughout the year. The average passage is 17 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. A French steamer leaves St. Nazaire once a month. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the cables from Cuba touch at, whence it branches away via St. Thomas, Barbados, &c., to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 41 stations, is now completed.

The Government Railway extends from Kingston to Porus, in the parish of Manchester, in one direction, a distance of 50 miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of Clarendon, in the other direction, a distance of 48 miles.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.

The rate of interest on the colony's debentures, which had been 6 per cent., was for some years subsequently reduced to 5 per cent., until the Railway Purchase and Railway Extension Loans were recently raised at 4½ and 4 per cent. respectively.

LABUAN.

The island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30-23 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of Borneo proper, about thirty miles.

The island, then uninhabited, was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846, and occupied in 1848.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, the development of which was undertaken by a Company which was formed in England at the time, under the name of "The Eastern Archipelago Company." The Company failed, and so have several others, and the coal resources of Labuan remain still undeveloped.

Labuan has a fine port, and is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo, and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, bees'-wax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, india-rubber, rattans, pearls, tortoise-shell, and tropang, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore.

There are three sago manufactories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to some extent for the Singapore market.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Borneo, and Chinese, the latter being chiefly petty traders.

The Government is administered by a Governor and a nominated Legislative Council.

Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant in aid, but since then the colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony.

The chief sources of Revenue are the farming of licences to sell tobacco, spirits, opium (retail), and fish, and customs levied according to the following tariff:

Brandy, arrack, and other spirits, $3 per dozen quarts, or two gallons.

Beer, 40 cents per dozen quarts, or two gallons.
Toddy, 40 cents per dozen quarts, or two gallons.
Cigars, 20 cents per lb.
Manufactured Tobacco, 10 cents per lb.
Fish (fresh or dried), 5 per cent. on value imported.

There is no export duty.

THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

The Leeward Islands, comprising the Colonies of Antigua, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, §4 & §5 Vict., cap. 107. The text of the Act, which is given below, will explain the constitution and powers of the Federal Government and the relations between that Government and the several Island Governments. Sir Benjamin Pine, to whose energy and ability the passage of the measure in the islands is largely due, was honoured by Her Majesty after the passing of the Imperial Act with the dignity of a Knight Commander of the order of St. Michael and St. George; Messrs. Wigley and Freeling, the administrators of St. Kitts and Dominica, being on the same occasion made Companions of the Order, and Sir Oliver Nugent, President of the Legislative Council of Antigua, receiving the honour of Knighthood.

It may be mentioned, as of historical interest, that the Leeward Islands possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several Islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 3 and 4, Will. IV, c. 74. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed, a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4l per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1832 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871 is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands.

Subjoined is the text of the Act.

CHAP. 107.

An Act for the Federation and general Government of the Leeward Islands (amended by local Act No. 11 of 1878). [21st August, 1871.]

Whereas the several legislative bodies of Her Majesty's Leeward Islands have, by certain resolutions, signified their desire for the union of the said Islands under one Government in manner therein set forth, and have requested that the said resolutions may be embodied in an Act of the Imperial Parliament with all such provisions as may necessary to give them full force and effect, and it is expedient that the said union should be established:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same as follows:—

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871."

2. So soon as this Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands, those islands shall form one colony, consisting of six presidencies, namely, the several islands of Antigua, Montserrat Saint Christopher, Nevis, and Dominica, with their respective dependencies, and the Virgin Islands.

3. In this Act the following terms shall have the meanings hereby assigned to them, unless there be something in the subject or context repugnant thereto (that is to say):

"Proclamation" shall mean a written or printed notice under the hand of the Governor, published by his order in each of the Presidencies which it may directly concern.

4. This Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands on a day to be declared by proclamation.

5. There shall be an Executive Council of the Leeward Islands, consisting of such persons or officers as the Queen may from time to time name or designate.

6. The Queen may from time to time appoint such officers of the general Government as Her Majesty may think fit, with such salaries as may be assigned to them by the General Legislature.

7. There shall be in the Leeward Islands a Legislative Body, to be styled "The General Legislative Council," composed of Ten elective and Ten non-elective members [thus re-enacted by Act 15 of 1882].

Provided that the proceedings of the Council shall not be invalid on account of any vacancies therein.

8. Of the elective members, Four shall be taken from the Island Council of Antigua, Two from the...
Legislative Assembly of Dominica, and four from among the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis. The members for Antigua and Dominica shall respectively be chosen by the elective members of the Island Council from which they are taken, and those for St. Christopher by the non-official members of the Legislative Council of St. Christopher, and Nevis in such manner as the said Island Council may, from time to time, by any standing rule determine, and within such period as may, from time to time, be prescribed by proclamation, and every such member shall ipso facto vacate his seat on ceasing to be a member of such Island Council. [This section is printed as re-enacted by the Leeward Islands Act 15 of 1882.]

11. Subject to the provisions of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sections of this Act, the Governor may, with the consent of the Legislative Body of any presidency, make laws for the peace, order, and good government thereof, but any island enactment relating to any of the subjects named in the preceding section may at any time be repealed or altered by the General Legislature, and shall, without any formal repeal, be void so far as it is repugnant to any law passed by the General Legislature.

12. The Council may from time to time be convoked, prorogued, and dissolved by any instrument under the hand and seal of the Governor.

13. The Council shall be so convoked within six months after this Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands, and afterwards once (at least) in every year.

14. The place of meeting of the Council shall from time to time be fixed by proclamation.

15. The duration of the Council, unless sooner dissolved, shall be three years.

16. Every member of the Council shall, before taking his seat, take and subscribe before the Governor, or some person authorized by him, the following oath of allegiance:

"I, A.B., do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and successors, according to law."

"So help me GOD."

But any person authorized by law to affirm or declare instead of taking an oath may make such affirmation or declaration in lieu of the said oath.

17. The Council shall appoint one of the members of the Council to be vice-president thereof.

18. Every member of the Council, except the official members, may resign his seat therein by writing under his hand addressed to the Governor.

19. Every elective member who shall accept any office under the Crown shall vacate his seat in the said Council, but shall be eligible for re-election.

20. When any elective member vacates his seat in the Council otherwise than by the dissolution or other determination thereof, the elective members of the island council which he represented shall choose a successor within three months after notice of such vacancy shall have been proclaimed in the presidency; and if they fail to do so within that time the Governor shall appoint a person from that island council to fill such vacancy.

21. Until otherwise determined by the Council, the Council shall not be considered as constituted for the despatch of business unless at least eleven members be present and assisting thereat.

22. Questions arising in the Council shall be decided by a majority of voices; the President shall, in all cases, have a vote, and when the voices are equal the decision shall be deemed to be in the negative.

23. No vote or resolution shall be proposed in the Council having for its object to charge any part of the revenues arising within the said Leeward Islands, except by one of the official members, or with the express approval or direction of the Governor.

24. When a Bill passed by the Council is presented to the Governor for his assent, he shall declare according to his discretion either that he assents thereto, or that he refuses his assent to the same, or that he reserves the same for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure thereon.

25. When the Governor assents to a Bill, he shall by the first convenient opportunity send an authentic copy of the law to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and it shall be lawful for Her Majesty at any time within eighteen months after such copy shall have been received by the said Secretary of State to notify to the Governor her disallowance of such law through one of her Principal Secretaries of State, and every such law shall become
null and void from and after the day on which the said Governor shall signify such disallowance by message to the Council, or from and after a day to be named by proclamation.

26. A Bill reserved for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure shall take effect so soon as Her Majesty shall have given her assent to the same by Order in Council, and the Governor shall have signified such assent by message to the Council or proclamation, provided that no such message or proclamation shall be issued after two years from the day on which the Bill was presented to the Governor for his assent.

27. The Council shall at its first meeting, and may from time to time afterwards, as occasion may require, adopt standing rules and orders for the orderly conduct of business, which rules and orders shall take effect when confirmed by the Governor.

28. The expenses of such establishments as are common to all the Leeward Islands, other than the remuneration and travelling expenses of the members of the Council, shall be fixed by the Council, and shall, until otherwise apportioned by the Council, be divided into sixteen parts, which shall be charged as follows:

| Island                  | Parts |
|-------------------------|-------|
| On Antigua              | 5     |

Such charges, however, as may be incurred in respect of immigration shall be shared only by such islands as may elect to participate therein.

29. An estimate of such expenses shall be every year prepared by the General Government and laid before the Council, and when passed by the Council shall be published in the Leeward Islands; and after such publication the Governor may, from time to time, as the occasion may require, draw on the public treasury of each presidency for the whole or any part of the amount due from such presidency.

30. The Council may, by any law or laws, alter from time to time any of the provisions of this Act: Provided that every such law shall be reserved by the said Governor for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure.

31. The term Governor or officer administering the Government, when used in any island enactment heretofore passed, shall, after this Act shall come into operation, and until otherwise provided by the Island Legislature, be taken to mean the Governor of the Leeward Islands or any other person appointed in that behalf by writing under his hand and under the Public Seal of the Presidency.

32. The powers conferred on Her Majesty by the fifth, sixth, and ninth sections of this Act may be exercised by instructions or warrants under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet, or may be delegated to the Governor by letters patent under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom; and such instructions, warrants, or letters patent may be issued before this Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands.

33. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, from time to time, on address from the Legislative Body of any of the West Indian Islands not included in this Act and from the Council, to bring such island under the operation of this Act, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed, and as Her Majesty thinks fit to approve, and the provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Imperial Parliament.
