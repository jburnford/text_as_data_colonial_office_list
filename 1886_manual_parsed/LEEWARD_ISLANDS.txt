ANTIGUA.

An island situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1498, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English in 1632. In 1663, Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. Area of the island is 108 square miles. About £7,500 is annually spent in the support of Poor Houses, Hospitals, Board of Health, and for Medical Relief, Vaccination, &c. There are 14 places of worship belonging to the Church of England, 13 Moravian, 10 Wesleyan.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; and a Legislative Council consisting of 24 members, of which the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Auditor-General, and Treasurer, are ex-officio members; 8 members nominated by the Crown and 12 elected members.

The qualifications for Members and Voters were fixed by an Act of 1845, and are as follows:

For Members.—An annual income of 66l. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of 200l. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of 26l. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or half of the value of 11l., or one acre of land and building value 222l., or tenancy paying not less than 88l. per annum.

The Island is divided into eleven electoral districts. Of the 208 voters registered for the whole Island, 130 are registered for the City of St. John. The districts are as follows:

| Members |
|---------|
| City of St. John | 2 |
| Division of St. John | 1 |
| Dickenson's Bay and Five Islands | 1 |
| Popeshead | 1 |
| Old Road | 1 |
| Bermudian Valley | 1 |
| New Division | 1 |

| Division of Old and New North Sound | 1 |
| Nonsuch | 1 |
| Belfast | 1 |
| Willoughby Bay | 1 |
| Division of Falmouth and Rendezvous Bay, and Towns Falmouth and English Harbour | 1 |

The Governor appoints the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Council, who in the event of an equality of votes shall have a second or casting vote. All grants or appropriations of money must originate with the Government Members. The duration of the Council is for five years. The elected members of the Legislative Council of Antigua send four elected members to the General Legislature.

**MONTSERRAT.**

This island, discovered by the celebrated Spanish navigator in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated in 16° 45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 12 miles in length, and 8 in the broadest part; its roads, however, are zigzag, uphill, and down ravine, so that a journey from the town of Plymouth (lying in the centre of the south-west coast) to north or south, exceeds the extreme length of the island.

Montserrat was colonized by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants: it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1762. M. Louis Joseph de Goullon, who was appointed Commandant, levied an impost of 1,800 Johannis, and demanded a furnished residence for himself, one for the Major, and others for the Treasurer, for the Commissary of Marine, for the Surgeon-Major, for warehouses of every kind, for a hospital, for a chapel for Divine service for the troops, and a residence near it for the chaplain, a residence for the keeper of the warehouses, and a chamber for his clerk. The House of Assembly provided the Governor with a furnished house, with horses, &c., &c., but offered a spirited resistance to the other demands.

The island was restored to the English in 1784. Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668.

The island is considered the most healthy of the Antilles.
By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly, a Legislative Council was established, having all the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. Her Majesty may from time to time by any warrant under her sign manual and signet, or by any instructions through one of her principal Secretaries of State, designate such officers and appoint such persons, not exceeding six in all, as she may think fit, to be respectively official, or ex officio and unofficial members of the said Council, every councillor holding office during Her Majesty's pleasure.

The Governor, and in his absence any person appointed by him in writing, shall preside at every meeting of the Council, and shall have an original and casting vote.

The principal export of the island is sugar, which is shipped in tierces and barrels: 3 tierces equal 2 hogsheads. In a very good year the crop yields 2,500 hogsheads. Many sugar works are furnished with steam engines, but there are still some fine properties which rely on the windmill; there are a few cattle mills, and two or three mills are worked by water power. For some years past there has been established a valuable staple export, viz., lime juice, raw and concentrated. There are (principally in the northern part of the island) about 650 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation is extending.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, macadamized, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects, as far as the small revenue of the island will permit.

**Tariff.**

The Customs Tariff is as follows:

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

(ST. KITTS.)

The following general description of St. Kitts is extracted from a Report on that Island, written by Lieutenant-Governor Sir Benjamin Pine, which was printed and laid before Parliament, March, 1862.

"The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

"The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The breadth of its main body is about five miles; that of the knob or peninsula is about two miles. The breadth of the neck varies from half a mile to a mile. The total area is 68 square miles.

"The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital.

"Immediately beyond these hills on the south-east is the narrowest part of the neck, which at this point is perfectly flat. But as it expands it rises into conical hills, which, covered with grass, prickly mimosas or aloes, traverse the knob or peninsula in almost every direction. In one spot, however, the hills recede from the sea, forming a basin, within which is a salt-pond about two miles in circumference.

"The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

"These tracts of land are covered with sugar plantations, and dotted over in every direction with homesteads, mills, and labourers' villages.

"The higher slopes of the mountains are clothed with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood."

The climate in St. Kitts, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. From observations made by Mr. Evelyn, the Receiver-General of the Colony, it appears that the average range of the thermometer was, in August in 1866, 8 a.m., 83° 1/2°, and in February of the same year, 77° 1/2°, 87° at noon, 86° at 4 p.m.

The average range of the thermometer was, in February, 1873, 9 a.m., 78°, and at 2 p.m., 81°, and in August of the same year, 9 a.m., 84°, and at 2 p.m., 86°.
The rainfall for the year 1884 was 45 ins.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 24th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he may appoint in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English in 1628. Its area is about 50 square miles. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form, its area about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea. The average height of the thermometer, 82°.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two Islands—the distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.

Sugar is the chief product of both islands. The sugar crop of 1884, amounted to 15,760 hogsheads in St. Kitts and 3,619 hogsheads in Nevis.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established, in which the Representative element was preserved, the majority of votes, however, resting with the nominees of the Crown. The Executive Council was reconstituted. The elected Members of the Nevis Assembly sent one Member to the General Legislature of the Leeward Islands.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead, to consist of such officers and persons not exceeding six in number, as Her Majesty might by warrant or by any instruction through a Secretary of State designate or appoint to be official or ex-officio and unofficial members of the said Assembly. The Governor had power to appoint provisionally to vacancies amongst the unofficial members. Three were a quorum. The Governor presided, or, in his absence, such person as he might appoint in writing.

Leeward Islands Act 2 of 1882, entitled, "An Act for the Union of the Presidencies of Saint Christopher and Nevis," came into operation on the 1st January, 1883, and the two Presidencies of Saint Christopher and Nevis, consisting of the Islands of Saint Christopher, Nevis, and Anguilla, with their respective dependencies, now form one Presidency, called the Presidency of Saint Christopher and Nevis.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of ten official and ten nominated unofficial members; the Governor, or, in his absence, a member appointed by him, presides, and the President enjoys an original and also a casting vote. Of the ten unofficial members, seven are chosen from among the inhabitants of St. Christopher and Anguilla, and three from Nevis. The council meets at Basseterre in St. Christopher.

ANGUILLA.

The island of Anguilla now forms part of the united Presidency of St. Christopher-Nevis.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at 650l., and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. But the island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,500, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock, which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, a duty on salt, licences, &c.

District Magistrate, J. L. Lake, 220l.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of rocks; the largest island in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situate in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The Danes also possess some of them; the more important of which are St. Thomas, St. John, and Santa Croix; whilst the Spaniards lay claim to those near Porto Rico.

A civil government, and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

Constitution: In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government, who is to preside at the meetings of the Council, and to have a casting as well as a deliberation vote.

There is also an Executive Council.

A small quantity of sugar is made in the Virgin Islands, and recently many of the landed proprietors have planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly, and appears likely to prove remunerative.

On October 29th, 1867, the islands were visited by a fearful hurricane, which was most destructive to life and property. Sir Arthur Rumbold's account is as follows:

"The storm lasted from eleven a.m. to three p.m., but the greatest force was from twelve to two. In that brief space of time, two-thirds of the miserable tenements of the town were blown down. The gaol is destroyed, the church, the hospital, pier, school-house, Wesleyan Chapel, and Poor-house are also destroyed, and my own dwelling unroofed and rendered uninhabitable.

"The loss of life cannot as yet be correctly ascertained. I have, however, been officially informed of above twelve deaths in the town, two at Peter's Island, two at West End; while I hear that a quantity of people are killed in other parts of the country, and scarcely a hut or habitation is left standing.

"All was bright and verdant, the withering blast has passed over it, and not a fruit or other tree remains. The works of the few remaining estates are all totally destroyed."

The islands also suffered severely, but not to so great an extent, in the hurricane of August, 1871.
