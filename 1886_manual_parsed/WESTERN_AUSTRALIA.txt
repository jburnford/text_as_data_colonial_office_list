The agricultural prosperity of the island is greatly retarded by want of water, and by locusts. The rainfall is somewhat deficient in the whole, and what there is, in great part goes to waste, from the unfortunate configuration of the country, the want of trees, and the lack of intelligent activity on the part of the peasants in its storage and distribution.

The work of locust destruction has been vigorously prosecuted for the last four years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the “screen and pit system.” The screens are stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march, and as they are topped with oilcloth, the locusts are unable to get over them, and are gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which they cannot emerge, as they are topped with a zinc lining.

It is estimated that on the average only one-third of the cultivable land in Cyprus is actually brought under cultivation in any one year.

The island has suffered greatly from the extensive destruction of its forests, but what remains of them is reported to be recovering under the better care now bestowed upon them.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, “in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements,” consented “to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England.” On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:—

“I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkémé-i-Shéréh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

“II. That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

“III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands let or sold during that period.

“IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazi Miriyé vé Emlaki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

“V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public use.

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of £3,000 a year.
provements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

"VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer, styled High Commissioner; a Legislative Council was established, to consist of the High Commissioner and not less than four, and not more than eight other members, half to be officials, and half to be inhabitants not holding office. The latter were appointed to seats in Council for two years, and were eligible for re-appointment. An Executive Council was also established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers of pardon, appointment, suspension from office, &c., &c., usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to the Legislative Council has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. Judges are not eligible for election. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The first Council is to be dissolved not later than the end of three years from its first election, which took place in May, 1883. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larissa, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner. For electoral purposes the island is divided into three districts, consisting of two administrative districts each.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal, consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to 5l.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkémé-i-Shérích, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadi's, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:—

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—
   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.
   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.
   (3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males.

3. Tithes of the principal products of the island, assessed in money.

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Import duties according to the following tariff:—

(The Oke = 2·8 lbs. Avordupois. 9 Cyprus Piastres = 1s.)

*Arms, 20 per cent. ad valorem.

*Ammunition, 20 per cent. ad valorem.

Salt, refined, 2 c.p. per oke.

The importation is prohibited of silver and copper coins, locust eggs, salt, except refined salt for table purposes, and of all vegetables dry or green except vegetables hermetically sealed in tin cases, and potatoes, all fresh fruits and flowers, and fruit trees coming from French, Turkish, Greek, Austrian, or Italian ports.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike. Certain titles on minor articles have been abolished, and also on grapes, carobs and silk cocoons; but on the two last named articles a 10 per cent. export duty, and on raisins exported a 12 per cent. duty have been imposed instead of fifte. All other export duties, and a fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

There is a military police force of about 700 men, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its medieval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum has been lately started by subscription.

NEW GUINEA.

New Guinea, the largest island in the world if we exclude Australia, lies some 80 miles to the north of Queensland between 8° 25' and 10° 40' S. lat., and between 130° 50' and 150° 35' E. long. Its greatest length is 1,490 miles, and its maximum breadth 430 miles; its area being about 306,000 square miles.

The northern coast of the island is generally hilly, and the mountains stretch away from it inland, rising in some cases to a height of 17,000 or 18,000 feet. The south coast also, to the east of Torres Straits, presents similar features, and a great mountain range appears to stretch across the island approximately along the 4th parallel of latitude. To the west of Torres Straits the south coast is low and swampy, no hills being visible. Over a great part of the island dense forests appear to prevail, clothing the mountains to a height of several thousand feet with timber of enormous height, covered and matted together with a dense undergrowth of brushwood, ferns, and lycopodiums. The coco palm grows everywhere, and the sago palm abounds on the south coast, and its produce forms a considerable part of the exports of the island. Figs are also common, and ginger, cardamum, betel, pineapple, nutmeg, cotton, and other smaller growths are found.

The bulk of the population is of the pure Papuan type, of a sooty brown colour, medium height, and general appearance somewhat negroid. At various points of the coast however the intermixture of Polynesian and Malayan blood has modified the native Papuan physically and mentally, and the coast tribes as a rule are superior in resources and civilization to those of the interior. Some of the tribes in the north-west, in the Arfak mountains and elsewhere, are very degraded, and with barely the rudiments of social organization; and cannibalism and head-hunting are practised here and there throughout the island.

The whole island to the west of 141 E. long. is claimed by the Dutch as suzerains of the Sultan of Tidore, to whom the tribes along the coast have been accustomed to pay tribute. The acquisition of the remainder of the island by this country has long been advocated by Australian statesmen, and the growing influence of France and Germany
in the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the establishment of a penal settlement by the former in New Caledonia, created considerable alarm lest a country lying so near the shores of Australia should pass into the possession of a foreign power. The Government of Queensland determined to precipitate matters by formally annexing the country, and this was accordingly done by Mr. Chester, the magistrate of Thursday Island, on the 4th of April, 1883. This proceeding was not adopted or ratified by the Imperial Government, and consequently fell to the ground; but the Australian colonies renewed their appeals to Her Majesty's Government to take possession of the island, and the Intercolonial Convention held at Sydney in November and December, 1883, passed resolutions urging the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, and undertaking to recommend to their respective legislatures to provide for defraying, in proportion to population, a part of the cost of maintaining the protectorate. Upon this the Imperial Government decided that if one or more of the colonies would guarantee £15,000l. for the year ending 1st June, 1885, they would appoint a high commissioner for the south-eastern part of New Guinea, and take steps for establishing his jurisdiction. The various colonies readily agreed to contribute their quota of the sum required, and on the 6th November, 1884, Commodore Erskine, in H.M.S. "Nelson," hoisted the British flag at Port Moresby, and proclaimed a protectorate over the south coast from 141° E. long. and the adjacent islands.

Special Commissioner for New Guinea, John Douglas, C.M.G., 2,500l.
Private Secretary (vacant).
Deputy Commissioner, Hugh Romilly, 200l.

WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between British subjects living in these Islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, or New South Wales, and not being within the jurisdiction of any civilised power, and includes that part of New Guinea which is eastward of the 143rd meridian of longitude, New Britain, New Ireland, the Louisiade Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, the Tongan or Friendly Islands, the Samoan or Navigators' Islands, and the various small groups of Melanesia.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a judicial commissioner, and where the attendance of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court is impracticable, the High Commissioner may appoint a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of her Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all her Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have jurisdiction civil and criminal analogous to that of Stipendiary Magistrates and Judges of County Courts with certain limited powers in respect of probate and letters of administration.

With some few exceptions all decisions of Deputy Commissioners may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases occurring where there is no resident Deputy Commissioner, certain officers in command of her Majesty's ships of war on the Australian station have been appointed Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The first High Commissioner was the Hon. Sir A. H. Gordon, lately Governor of Fiji, and now Governor of Ceylon.

Establishment.

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POSSESSIONS.

ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. Besides the peninsula a strip of territory stretching about three miles inland belongs to England. The whole area being about seventy square miles. The town of Aden is situated on the side of a rocky promontory, and is very strongly fortified. It is a most important coaling station, and also an entrepôt for the trade with Arabia. The imports in 1883 amounted to 2,014,580l., and the exports to 1,444,890l. The exports consist of coffee, dyes, feathers, gums, spices, &c. The settlement is subject to the government of Bombay, being presided over by a president, who is also commander of the troops in the garrison. (For further information see publications relating to India).

Perim, an island situated at the entrance of the Red Sea, is a dependency of Aden, and in consideration of an undertaking not to cede to any other Power than Great Britain Socotra, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, and lying in the direct route to India,
the government of Aden pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belongs. The area of the island is about 3,000 square miles.

ASCENSION.

The island of Ascension, lying in the South Atlantic, lat. 70° 57' S. and long. 14° 21' W., is under the supervision of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who maintain a small naval station there. It is frequented by whalers engaged in the antarctic fishing, and is famous for its turtles, large numbers of which are caught annually.

NIGER.

The protectorate over the Niger Delta, stretching from the Rio del Rey to the Benin River, was assumed in July, 1881, treaties of protection with all the principal chiefs being made by Consul Hewett. A number of vice-consuls have been appointed to assist Mr. Hewett in controlling the protectorate. The enormous trade of the district is almost entirely in the hands of the National African Company, of which Lord Aberdare is chairman.

PONDOLAND.

Pondoland has been under protection since 1844, when Sir Peregrine Maitland entered into a treaty with Faku, then paramount chief. In 1878 Sir Bartle Frere, as High Commissioner, intervened in the affairs of Pondoland, deposing Umgikela from the position of paramount chief, and placing half the tribe under the independent rule of Unquiliso. He renewed the declaration of protectorate, and annexed the St. John's River Mouth, which has since been incorporated with the Cape Colony. The existence of the British protectorate over Pondoland was recently notified anew in the Cape Gazette. (See further as to Pondoland under "Cape Colony," ante, Part II.)

TRISTAN D'ACUNHA.

Tristan d'Acunha is the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6' S. and long. 12° 2' W. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. Upon his death the garrison was withdrawn with the exception of three men, who, with certain shipwrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement. For a long time only one of the settlers had a wife, but subsequently the others contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. The population has since increased to about a hundred, and remains practically stationary, as the younger and more ambitious settlers migrate in batches to the Cape. The inhabitants practically enjoy their possessions in common, and there is no strong drink on the island, consequently there are no quarrels and no crime. It was at one time proposed to give them laws and a regular government, but this was found unnecessary for the above reasons, and they remain under the moral rule of their oldest inhabitant, Governor Green, successor to Governor Glass, Corporal in the Royal Artillery, and founder of the settlement. The islands are within the diocese of Cape Town, and a chaplain is maintained there by the S. P. G. The inhabitants are spoken of as long-lived, healthy, moral, religious, and hospitable to strangers. They have recently been entrusted with a life boat by the Board of Trade, and a code of signals.

The following notice is printed as being of general interest.—Ed. C. O. List.

INFORMATION RESPECTING FREE AND ASSISTED PASSAGES TO THE COLONIES.

Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W., October, 1885.

The Colonies which promote immigration from the United Kingdom by means of their public funds are New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia, New Zealand, the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, and Canada.

NEW SOUTH WALES

The Agent-General for New South Wales is authorised by the Colonial Government to provide (under existing regulations) Passages in first-class steamships to emigrants of the undermentioned classes, viz.:

Married couples not exceeding 40 years of age, with or without children, and unmarried men and women not exceeding 35 years of age.

All emigrants from the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe are to be selected and approved by the Agent-General in London, or by such persons as he may appoint for the purpose.

Approval of such emigrants is limited to married persons not exceeding 40 years of age, with or without children, and to unmarried males and females not exceeding 35 years of age. The persons to be introduced are to be of sound mental and bodily health, and of good moral character, to consist of farmers, mechanics, miners, domestic servants, any description of labourers suitable for country pursuits, to be chosen with a special regard to the industrial requirements of the Colony, and small working capitalists.

Female domestic servants are much required in New South Wales, and can obtain good engagements on arrival.

Rates of Payment to be made to the Agent-General.

| Married couples not exceeding 40 years each person | 6l. per couple. |
| Single adult males | 4l. each. |
| Children of three and under 14 years of age | 1l. each. |
| Children under three years of age | Free. |
| Single females of the above-named class are taken at a reduced rate of | 2l. each. |

For further information, application should be made to Sir Saul Samuel, K.C.M.G., Agent-General for New South Wales, 5, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W.

VICTORIA.

Free and assisted emigration to this Colony is for the present suspended.

The Agent-General's office is at No. 8, Victoria Chambers, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Emigration is at present suspended, and when it is resumed passages will be granted only to persons who have been nominated by their friends in the Colony, and to single female domestic servants if of irreproachable character.

Sums varying from 5s. to 15s. per adult, according to distance from the port of embarkation, are allowed by the Emigration Agent towards travelling expenses, but these payments are only made to approved candidates on arrival at the Plymouth Depot, and who produce their embarkation orders for the ship they are summoned for.

The Emigration Agent supplies, free of charge, provisions, medical attendance, and cooking utensils, on board the ship; also new mattresses, bolsters, blankets, and counterpanes, canvas bags to contain linen, &c., knives and forks, spoons, metal plates, and drinking mugs, which become the property of the emigrants on their arrival in the Colony, unless through disease having occurred during the voyage the Government decide to destroy them.

Further information respecting South Australia may be obtained on application to Sir Arthur Blyth, K.C.M.G., the Agent-General and Emigration Agent for the Colony, No. 8, Victoria Chambers, Victoria Street, S.W.
EMIGRATION.

QUEENSLAND.

Emigration to Queensland is regulated by the "Immigration Act of 1882," and is principally conducted according to the provisions of the 17th section of that Act, under which a contract has been made with Messrs. Gray, Dawes, and Co., 13, Austin Friars, to convey, in steamers, passengers approved by the Agent-General, at the following rates:

Passage money, 7l. per adult; ship kit, 1l. per adult; children between 1 and 12 years of age, 3L 10s.; two children counting as one adult for ship kit; second cabin, 21L 10s.

Colonial nominees are provided with passages upon payments made to the Immigration Agent in Brisbane, at the following rates:

| Ages          | Males | Females |
|---------------|-------|---------|
|               | Amount| Amount  |
| Between 1 and 12 | £     | £       |
| Between 12 and 40 | 1     | 1       |
| Above 40 and under 55 | 2     | 1       |
| Above 55      | Full amount of passage money. | Full amount of passage money. |

Free passages are granted to female domestic servants and unmarried farm labourers between 17 and 35 years of age.

For all particulars as to Land Laws and resources, and for free passages, applications are to be addressed to the Agent-General for Queensland, 1, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, London, S.W., but applications for assisted passages should be addressed to the above-mentioned firms.

TASMANIA.

At the present time (October, 1885) all arrangements for granting free or assisted passages from England to Tasmania are suspended, excepting to emigrants nominated by persons residing in the Colony.

The Board of Immigration in Tasmania is empowered to appoint agents in England for the purpose of selecting emigrants and arranging for their conveyance to Tasmania. These agents have also power to issue Warrants for free grants of Land on the following terms:

The agents shall issue to each approved emigrant who has not previously resided in the Colony, and who pays the full cost of his family's passage out, a warrant, which will entitle the holder to receive a Land Order to the value of 18l. for each member of the family above 15 years of age, and 9l. for each member above 12 months and under 15 years old; and these Land Orders will be received by the Government as payment for any Crown lands that the emigrant may buy after his arrival.

The Acts also empower the Immigration Board to permit any person who has paid his own and family's passage-money as cabin or intermediate passengers, to demand, within a year after his arrival in the Colony, a land certificate entitling him to select 30 acres of land for himself, 20 for his wife, if he has one, and 10 for each child, provided he has not already obtained a Land Order Warrant.

For these lands a grant will be issued after five years' residence; and the order will not be forfeited by the death of the emigrant, or by his absence, if his family remain in the Colony.

Applications for land order warrants, assisted passages, and for general information respecting the Colony may be made to the Tasmania Government Emigration Agents, viz., the Emigrant and Colonist's Aid Corporation (Limited), at their office, 36, Gracechurch Street, London, E.C.

NEW ZEALAND.

Free and assisted passages are not now granted by the Government of New Zealand except in a few special cases, when the sum of 7l. 10s. (half cost of passage) has to be paid for each adult and in proportion for the passage of each child. No further nominations for single women or others will at present be entertained.

Persons who have been in Australia or New Zealand are not in any case eligible.

Application for passages and for information respecting New Zealand may be made to Sir Francis Dillon Bell, K.C.M.G., the Agent-General for New Zealand, No. 7, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, Westminster, London, S.W.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Free passages are granted to a limited number of emigrants of the following classes, nominated by persons residing in the Colony, and approved by the Emigration Agent in England, viz.:

I. Artisans, farmers, agricultural labourers, vine dressers, miners, shepherds, and gardeners, under 45 years of age (and, if married, their wives and families).

II. Single female domestic servants (or
widows) not exceeding 35 years of age. Nominations remain in force for twelve months from the date on which they are issued by the Board of Immigration, and emigrants who do not within that period inform the Emigration Agents in London that they are ready to embark, will forfeit their claim to free passages.

Such emigrants must intend to follow one of these occupations in the Colony; must be of good health, character, and ability; must not have previously resided in Western Australia, nor have been in the habitual receipt of parish relief.

Bedding and mess utensils will be provided for the voyage, for which each emigrant will be required to pay £1. Emigrants must provide their own outfit, and must pay their own travelling expenses to the port of embarkation.

It is desirable that emigrants should take out with them the necessary tools of their trade, but the whole quantity of baggage allowed for each adult must not measure more than 20 cubic feet nor weigh more than half a ton.

The Emigration Agent or Agents for the Colony in London may, when specially authorised by the Board of Immigration so to do, grant free or assisted passages from the United Kingdom to persons other than nominated emigrants, such persons being domestic servants, farm servants, gardeners, vine dressers, wood makers, miners, quarrymen, navvies, engineers, engine-fitters, engine drivers, railway carriage builders, carpenters, bricklayers, stonemasons, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, shipbuilders, and the like, and such other persons as the said Emigration Agent or Agents, with the authority of the Board of Immigration, shall deem eligible.

An assisted passage shall mean a passage towards the cost of which the Emigration Agent or Agents for the Colony in London may, by virtue of the authority referred to in the foregoing paragraph, contribute the sum of 10l.

Each intending emigrant above the age of 15 years desiring to obtain a free or assisted passage must undertake to conform to all regulations established on board ship during the voyage, and to remain in the Colony for at least 12 months from the date of arrival.

Arrangements will be made for the reception of emigrants on landing.

Any person in good health and not likely to become chargeable to the Colony, and by whom or on whose behalf the contract rate of passage money shall have been paid, may be allowed a passage on board any emigrant ship proceeding to the Colony on signing an agreement to conform to the rules to be observed on board ship.

For further particulars application may be made to the acting Emigration Agents for the Colony, viz., the Crown Agents for the Colonies, Downing Street, London.

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Artisans engaged for the Government service are provided with an assisted passage out. Those who are engaged for private persons, and for whom an order for an assisted passage has been obtained from the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, Cape Town, and who can satisfy the Emigration Agent that they are fit and proper persons for such employment, will be forwarded to any one of the ports of the Colony, on terms to be ascertained on application. Generally speaking, these passages are paid for by the employer, and are not charged to the employé unless he or she breaks the engagement.

The classes eligible for the aided passage are agricultural labourers, gardeners, farm servants, domestic servants, and artisans. Clerks are not eligible, nor are persons of that class advised to go out.

Each passenger is allowed to take 10 cubic feet of luggage, and is at liberty to take with him whatever he can put into that space, whether tools, clothing, bedding, &c. For all luggage above 10 cubic feet the ship's charges are 1s. 3d. per cubic foot. Bedding is not required on the voyage, each berth being fully provided in that respect.

Passages of emigrants are arranged for 14 days before the sailing of the steamer, and none can be guaranteed after that date. A steamer sails from England every week, the ports of departure being London and Southampton alternately. Emigrants must pay their own expenses to the port of departure.

Every person proposed to be introduced into the Colony as an assisted emigrant, must obtain a medical certificate to the satisfaction of the Emigration Agent of his being in good health at the time of emigrating or entering into an agreement to emigrate.

All emigrants must be seen and approved by the Emigration Agent before embarkation.

Testimonials or references as to character, and as to skill in trade or occupation, must be produced in every case.

Assisted emigrants must proceed to the Colony within one month of the date of notification, failing which the order will be cancelled.

Wages are a fair percentage higher than in England, and the prospects of advancement for good and steady men very much greater.

The cost of living varies considerably in different parts of the country. In some it is not more than in England, in others it is 15 or 20 per cent. greater; but the wages vary proportionately.

Applications respecting passages should be addressed to the Agent-General for the Cape of Good Hope, Emigration Department, 7, Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London, S.W.

NATAL.

At the present time all arrangements for granting free or assisted passages from England to Natal are suspended; the Land and Immigration Board in the Colony are considering the conditions on which the granting of such passages may be renewed.

Further information can be obtained on application to Walter Peace, Esq., Natal Government Emigration Agent, No. 21, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C.
DOMINION OF CANADA.

Assisted passages are granted by the Government of Canada to agriculturalists, farm labourers, and their families, and to female domestic servants by the steamships of the Allan Line from Liverpool, Londonderry, and Queenstown, by the Dominion and Beaver Lines from Liverpool, by Messrs. J. and A. Allan's Line from Glasgow, by the Temperley Line from London, and by the Great Western Line from Bristol. The rates include conveyance from the ports named to Quebec and Halifax in Canada, and food and sleeping accommodation on board ship. Ten cubic feet of luggage are allowed free to each statute adult. Reduced railway fares in favour of emigrants are also in operation from the ports of landing to every part of the Dominion, and such persons are strongly advised to book through to their destinations. The assisted passages vary from time to time with the ordinary rates. Full and reliable information can, however, be obtained from the Government Agents or from the Steamship companies mentioned above. Passengers have to provide bedding and certain utensils for use on board, which are enumerated in the bills of the steamship companies. They can be purchased at the port of embarkation, or hired for the voyage from some Lines for a few shillings, leaving bed-covering (a rug or blanket) to be provided by the passenger. Persons eligible for these passages must make application on the forms prepared for the purpose, which can be obtained from the Canadian Government Agents in Great Britain. The names and addresses of these gentleman are as follows:

Liverpool—Mr. John Dyke, 15, Water Street.
Glasgow—Mr. Thomas Grahame, 40, St. Enoch Square.
Belfast—Mr. Charles Foy, 35, Victoria Place.
Dublin—Mr. Thomas Connolly, Northumberland House.
Bristol—Mr. J. W. Down, Bath Bridge.

Depôts or stations for the reception of immigrants are provided at Quebec, Halifax (N.S.), St. John (N.B.), Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, London (Ont.), Hamilton, Winnipeg, Brandon, Qu'Appelle, Calgary, Dufferin, and Emerson. Government Agents are stationed at these places, and they should be inquired for on arrival. They will furnish information as to free grants and other lands open for settlement in their respective provinces and districts, farms for sale, investment of capital, demand for labour, rates of wages, route of travel, distances, expenses of conveyance, receive and forward letters for settlers, and give any other information that may be required.

These stations are fitted up so as to afford immigrants all necessary conveniences for cooking, sleeping, washing, and accommodation for luggage, &c. Medical attendance and hospital accommodation are afforded by the Government in all cases of sickness. Domestic servants are received at Quebec by the Lady Superintendent of the Government Female Immigration Department, who will give every advice and assistance that may be possible until they are placed in situations. Every important place in Canada is connected with the ports of landing by railway, affording not only cheap transport to every province, but also the means of conveying the produce of the country to the coasts for shipment.

The Canadian Pacific Railway is now in operation from Quebec to British Columbia, across the summit of the Rocky Mountains. It is expected to be completed to the coast of British Columbia at an early date, and will, with the Intercolonial Railway, form a short overland route to China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and India. The Canadian Pacific Railway affords direct communication with Manitoba and the North-West Territories, and the line passes in its entirety through British territory, opening up an immense area of fertile prairie land for settlement. An officer of the Government travels with parties of emigrants on the railway from Quebec and Halifax in order to see that their wants are properly attended to, and that they are not subjected to any imposition on the journey. There are many other railways passing through the various provinces of the Dominion.

Agricultural labourers should arrive in Canada early in the spring. By leaving this country in the middle of April they will reach their destination at a time when labour is wanted. There is always a steady demand for good farm labourers and female domestic servants.

Mechanics, general labourers, and navvies are not so largely in demand this year as usual. This is owing to the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which has released a great number of men who have for the time met the requirements. The assisted passages are not, therefore, available for such labour until further notice.

Applications for assisted passages and full particulars of the free grants of land and other advantages offered to settlers in Canada should be addressed to Sir Charles Tupper, K.C.M.G., C.B., the High Commissioner for Canada (Joseph Colmer, Esq., Secretary; C. C. Chipman, Esq., Assistant Secretary), Canada Government Offices, 9, Victoria Chambers, London, S.W., or to the Government Agents referred to in a previous paragraph.
