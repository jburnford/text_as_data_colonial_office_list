WEST AFRICA SETTLEMENTS.
(SIERRA LEONE AND GAMBIA.)

See Map.

SIERRA LEONE.

Sierra Leone proper consists of a peninsula terminating in Cape Sierra Leone, and bounded on the north by a river of the same name. The Cape lies in 8° 30' N. lat., 13° 18' W. long. The peninsula is 18 miles in length by 12 in breadth, with an area of 800 square miles. Sierra Leone was ceded to Great Britain in 1787 by the native chiefs. Four years afterwards a charter was granted to a Company under the name of "The Sierra Leone Company." In 1800 a grant of the peninsula was made to the Company by Letters Patent, and a Court of Directors of the Company was empowered to appoint a Governor and Council, the former having power to enact laws; this state of things lasted 7 years, when the colony was transferred back to the Crown.

In 1862 a large tract of country called Sherbro was handed over by treaty to the Colony. In 1879 further territory was acquired in the Scarcies River to the north of the peninsula. In 1884 the seaboard of the Sulymah and Gallinas Chiefs as far as the Mannah River was also annexed. These additions have largely increased the size of the colony; the total area is now estimated to be about 2,000 square miles.

By a Charter issued on May 27, 1863, an Executive Council was created, composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council, and "such other Person or Persons as We, by any Instruction or Warrant under Our Sign-Manual and Signet, may from time to time hereafter nominate and appoint to be members of the said Legislative Council."

In 1865, it was decided that a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa should be established, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone. This change was effected by a Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, which revoked and determined the former commissions issued in respect of Sierra Leone, the Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, and constituted on the West Coast of Africa one Government-in-Chief, to be called the Government of the West Africa Settlements, and to comprise the four settlements aforesaid. Within each of the four said settlements a Legislative Council was established.

Within the settlement of Sierra Leone, an Executive Council was established for the purpose of advising and assisting the Governor-General.

By a new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, was revoked as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos, under the Government-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements; and those settlements were erected into a distinct government.

The government of Sierra Leone and the Gambia continued during the remainder of the year 1874 to be administered under the Charter of 19th February, 1866. That Charter was then revoked by a new one, &c., dated 17th of December, 1874, which erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," and created a legislative council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent have since been issued, dated 17th June, 1885, providing for the continuance of the Government on the same lines with some minor differences. There is an executive council at Sierra Leone, and the power of pardon and suspension is given to the Governor-in-Chief.

Steamers leave Liverpool for Madeira and Freetown every Saturday, and the average length of passage is 7 days to Madeira, and 8 or 9 days from Madeira to Freetown. Every third week one of the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company touches at Bathurst, Gambia. The steamers that go to Bathurst are the only ones that call at Goree, the French settlement about 95 miles from Gambia. The homeward bound steamers perform the same route as the outward bound ones. A contract has been entered into for the establishment of telegraphic communication with England, and the cable is already laid as far as Conakry, 80 miles north of Freetown.

The climate of Sierra Leone is unhealthy, especially for Europeans. The seasons are divided into wet and dry; the former commencing in June, and lasting till November. The beginning and ending of the wet season are the most sickly periods of the year.

The rain-fall during the past four years has averaged over 135 inches in Freetown.

THE GAMBIA.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 18° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a-half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, and separated from the mainland by a narrow channel, called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is covered by a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The settlement on the River Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary's, British Combo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, and McCarthy's Island. McCarthy's Island is situated between the falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and is 187 miles distant from the latter. It forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river.

The principal productions of the settlement and of the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, beeswax, rice, cotton, maize, and a corn called kous. Of these, however, only ground nuts, hides, and beeswax are exported. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into native cloths called pagna, there are no manufacturing industries worth the name in the country.

In the early part of the year 1881 an expedition (The Upper Gambia Expedition), under the com-
mand of Dr. Gouldsbury, Administrator of the Gambia, set out from the settlement for the purpose of examining the upper river, with a view of ascertaining its capabilities as a highway for trade between the coast and the interior, and also with the object of reaching Timbo, the capital of the extensive Futa Jallon country, and from thence returning to the coast at Sierra Leone.

The upper portion of the River Gambia was found to be extremely winding, and in many parts obstructed by rocks, sand banks, and shallows, and the country on either bank appeared to be totally destitute of inhabitants.

The expedition in its course crossed over the Gambia, the Grey River (a tributary of the Gambia), the Rio Grande, and the Senegal, and for several weeks travelled through a very hilly country, and along paths that were very rugged and steep. None of the countries traversed by the expedition were thickly, or even moderately populated, and the largest town met with (Toobah) numbered only about 800 huts. Timbo itself was found to be a rather insignificant town, having neither the extent, population, nor wealth ascribed to it by popular belief.

Taking into consideration the limited population, the great distances, the difficult roads, the frequency of native wars, the absence of industrial habits amongst the people, Dr. Gouldsbury came to the conclusion that but little increase of trade with the interior was to be anticipated, at least for a great number of years to come.

Treaties were made with several chiefs, and with the King of Futa Jallon, and the expedition was well received everywhere.

The expeditionary party arrived at Sierra Leone in the latter end of April, having taken exactly three months to accomplish the journey, and having travelled over a distance of about 1,000 miles.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants of Exeter to trade in the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed for the purpose of carrying on the trade. It was not successful, and another established two years later experienced a like want of success.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, it appears that the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade till 1816, in which year a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary's by British merchants from Senegal.

The Administrator of the Gambia exercises no jurisdiction over the population surrounding the British settlements.

The settlement was at first subject to the Government of Sierra Leone. In 1843 it was created an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. It became a portion of the government of West Africa Settlements by the charter of 19th February, 1866, and continues to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874.

The distances of the principal districts and British settlements are as follows:

- From Sierra Leone to the Gambia: 500 miles
- Senegal to the Gambia: 180 miles
- St. Mary's to St. James's Island: 17 miles
- St. James's to Elephant Island: 80 miles
- Elephant to Deer Island: 45 miles
- St. Mary's to Barraconda Falls: 800 miles
- Barraconda to Fort St. Joseph: 152 miles
