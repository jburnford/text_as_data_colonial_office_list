WESTERN AUSTRALIA

Includes all that portion of the Australian continent west of the 129th degree of E. longitude.

The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

Western Australia was first settled in 1829.

The Government is administered by a Governor, assisted by an Executive Council.

There is a Legislative Council of 24 members, of whom 4 are official, 4 nominated, and 16 elected.

There are 13 electoral districts, the two principal towns, Perth and Fremantle, and the Northern District, returning two members each, and the remainder one member each.

The qualification for the franchise is a freehold estate of 100l., or a household tenancy of 10l. annual value, or the possession of a pastoral lease or licence of the same annual value.

The total area of the colony is, in round numbers, a million square miles. Of this immense tract, 2,700 square miles only have been alienated from the Crown, while 250,000 square miles are leased for pastoral purposes. No less than 747,800 square miles are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line of the colony, a length of 5,000 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, three hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley and Eucla districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied. The total population of the colony is as yet only 33,000 souls, excluding the aboriginal natives.
North of Champion Bay, the rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes, but Geraldton is the centre of a fertile and flourishing agricultural district. In the south-west corner of the colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. South of the 30th parallel of latitude, the whole face of the country is covered by dense forests, or more open timber, or smaller trees and thickets. The principal mountains are the Stirling and the Darling ranges in the south, the Hamersley range, near Roebourne, and the Leopold range in the Kimberley district. There are hilly and undulating tracts, but the landscape is generally of a level nature. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total cultivated area is about 80,000 acres, and, beyond this, the traveler's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty.

Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The principal industry, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 1,550,000) are depastured in all parts of the colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. As far north as Geraldton, the climate, and the tracts of good soil, are well adapted for nearly all English garden and orchard produce and cereals; and the vine, orange, fig, and other fruits of the south of Europe flourish luxuriantly. A considerable quantity of wine is made, and this industry may one day assume large proportions.

A great part of the forests of the south is heavy timber country. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. Some of these companies have constructed lines of railway of their own, as much as 20 miles in length, and carry on their operations on a considerable scale. But there is scope for a far larger industry. Sandalwood is still abundant, and is exported to Singapore and China. A species of Eucalyptus in the southern forests, known as the "Karri," attains a gigantic size and height (sometimes nearly 300 feet), and wide tracts of these great trees are now being worked, and their timber is reported to be equal to "Jarrah."

At Sharks Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounts to about 25,000l. per annum.

Lead and copper mines are worked in the Champion Bay district. The former are most productive, but the industry has been affected by the decline in the price of the ore. Some rich lodes of copper have been lately opened. Gold exists in various parts of the colony. Some excellent specimens have been recently discovered in the Kimberley district, and it seems likely that a good field will soon be found there.

The colony possesses at present two lines of Government Railways; a line (90 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, and with Guildford and York; and a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district. In addition to these, large schemes for the construction of several hundred miles of railways on the land grant method have been initiated and are in progress.

The chief towns of the colony are connected by an extensive telegraph system, which joins with the continental lines at Eucla, on the South Australian border. It may be said that every centre of population, as far north as Roebourne within the tropics, has, or will shortly have, its telegraph office. There are 2,335 miles of telegraph lines now open.

Every effort is being made by the Government to invite immigrants to the colony; and considerable sums are being spent to provide free passages for a desirable class of colonists.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The death-rate is extremely low, and old age appears almost a matter of course. Nothing can exceed the charm of the light clear air; and bright sunny days extend over nine months of the year. In fact, the climate of the greater part of the colony surpasses in health-giving excellence that of the most favoured spots of southern Europe. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The winter rains are neither bleak nor excessive.

Western Australia is one of the few remaining parts of the Empire in which there is still ample, almost boundless, scope for enterprise and settlement. It has lately taken a remarkable stride forward, and is now coming much into notice as a field for capital and immigrants. The colony has had, and still has, its drawbacks: but most of these are being fast surmounted, as its immense territory and varied resources become more known and developed, both by private enterprise and by the energetic prosecution of public works by the Government, and as wealthier and more settled colonies fill up towards the level of old communities.

WINDWARD ISLANDS.

GRENADE.

Grenada is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 76,538 acres, with a population, by the Census of 1881, of 42,403 souls. It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and between it and the latter island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, partly attached to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 5,154 souls.

The country is mountainous and very picturesque, and abounds in streams and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, 7 miles from St. George, and Lake Antoine are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. The chief productions of Grenada are cocoa, spices, and sugar, and those of Carriacou are cotton, ground provisions and live-stock.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was named Ascension. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillae for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the Colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. Major-General Edward Mathew was appointed Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Grenada and of Carriacou, and from that date to this time the government of Grenada has been confined within these limits. In 1787 St. George's was made a free port.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation.

In 1854 an Act was passed regaining the election of members of Assembly. The House of Assembly was to consist of 26 members, of whom 4 were returned for the town of St. George, 7 by the united parishes of St. George and St. John, 6 by the united
parishes of St. Patrick and St. Mark, 6 by the united parishes of St. Andrew and St. David, and 3 by Carriacou.

The Assembly was elected for seven years.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members selected by the Crown from the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. During the continuance of this Act the executive functions of the Legislative Council ceased, and were exercised by the new Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a-year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieutenant-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vic., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council has been established by the Queen, consisting of the Governor for the time being, and such persons, not fewer than three, as Her Majesty may designate by instructions or warrant.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, constituting anew the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, under which Grenada was made the head-quarters of the group comprising Grenada, St. Vincent, Tobago, and St. Lucia. The Executive Council of Grenada consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, and the Treasurer, and such other persons as Her Majesty may appoint from time to time. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, and such other official members as Her Majesty may appoint, and of such unofficial members, not exceeding five, as Her Majesty may appoint.
