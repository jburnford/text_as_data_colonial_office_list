HONG KONG.

Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, between 22° 9' and 22° 1' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kow-loon was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China; and now forms part of the colony. The general aspect of the island is extremely beautiful. It possesses one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles, the picturesque hills which surround it rising between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The City of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills, which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains upwards of 6,000 houses of stone and brick. The residences of the English and foreign merchants are numerous, and most of them are large and handsome mansions. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees.

The minimum annual rainfall for the last 16 years was 56 inches and the maximum 99 inches, the annual average being 78-54 inches, while the average range of the thermometer is from 43° to 89°.

The Colony was first ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843.

Hong Kong is valuable to Great Britain mainly as a factory for our commerce with China, and as a military and naval station for the protection of that commerce. Its distance from Singapore is about 1,520 miles.

Hong Kong is the centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms.

As Hong Kong is a free port, it is impossible to
give a correct return of imports and exports, but
the enormous extent of the trade with which it is
connected, may be approximately estimated from
the fact that the amount of shipping, British,
Foreign, and Chinese, which entered the port in
1882 exceeded five millions of tons, that is, it
exceeded the shipping which entered the port of
London in 1843, when Hong Kong was little more
than a desolate island, inhabited only by a few
Chinese pirates and fishermen.

Of the Chinese population of the colony it is
estimated that 40,000 have been born under the
British flag. The Anglo-Chinese traders take
a large part in sending British goods throughout
China.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accom-
modation. There are five docks and three slips
which are well supplied with shears, engineer's
and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every
requirement for making large repairs to ships of
war and merchant vessels.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly
the whole world; and there is very extensive
steam communication with Europe, America, and
Australia.

In addition to the regular mail lines of the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Com-
pany and the Messageries Maritimes which convey
the European mails weekly, the Pacific Mail
Steam Navigation Company have a fortnightly
service, via Yokohama, Japan, with San Francisco,
and the Eastern and Australian Mail Steam
Company have a monthly service with the Austra-
lian Colonies.

The distance of Hong Kong from the following
places is about:

| Miles | Length of voyage |
|-------|-----------------|
| Amoy  | 280             |
| Bangkok | 1,450          |
| Brisbane | 5,360         |
| Canton   | 80              |
| Kobe     | 1,629           |
| Manila   | 620             |

| Pekin    | 1,615           |
| Saigon   | 910             |
| Shanghai | 800             |
| Singapore | 1,500         |
| Sydney (mail route), via Torres Straits | 5,700 |
| San Francisco, via Yokohama | 6,480 |
| Vladivostock | 1,903       |
| Yokohama, Japan | 1,620 |

There is daily steam communication between
Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton, and about twice
a-week with the ports of Swatow, Amoy, Foo
Chow, Shanghai, and other ports on the coast of
China. The communication with Japan is a little
over a weekly one.

The Government is administered by a Governor,
aided by an Executive Council, composed of five
officials besides the Governor. The Legislative
Council is presided over by the Governor, and is
composed of the Chief Justice, the Colonial Secre-
tary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the
Surveyor-General, the Registrar-General, and five
unofficial members, three of whom are nominated
by the Crown on the recommendation of the
Governor, one is nominated by the Justices of the
Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber
of Commerce. By the provisions of the Vice-
Admiralty Courts' Act of 1863, the Governor is
ex-officio Vice-Admiral, and the Chief Justice ex-
officio Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court.

There is a Police force in the Colony numbering
648 men, of whom 113 are Europeans, 188 Sikhs
and 342 Chinese.

Hong Kong pays 20,000l. a-year to the Imperial
Government as military contribution.
