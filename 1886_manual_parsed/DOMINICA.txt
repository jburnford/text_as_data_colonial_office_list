DOMINICA.

Dominica is an Island, situated in the centre of the Carribean Sea, between 15° 20' and 15° 45' N. lat., and 61° 13' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad; very mountainous and picturesque; was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd November, 1493, on his second voyage.

This island was included in the grant made of sugar islands in the Carribean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by

* Chiefly cattle.
the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations. In 1756, Dominica became by conquest a dependency of England.

By the ninth article of the peace, signed at Paris between England and France in 1763, Dominica was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling the lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £12,092. 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising, besides Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart.

On the 21st June, 1775, the Royal Proclamation was issued, fixing a qualification for candidates and electors for the House of Assembly, and regulating the proceedings at elections, which is still in force.

In 1771, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Ducluilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor; trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795, another invasion of the island was attempted under the direction of Victor Hughes, the French Republican Chief, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadaloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £12,000 to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prevost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts, making ready for battle, should they be attacked. Since this period the island has not known war.

The extent of the island is estimated at 186,436 acres. It abounds in rivers and rivulets, well stocked with fish, and there is abundance of game in the island.

The Local Government is administered by a President, aided by an Executive Council of seven members. In 1865, during the temporary administration of Mr. (now Sir) W. C. F. Robinson, now Governor of South Australia, the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members, to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The president presides over the deliberations of this body, and exercises a casting vote in the House, and a deliberative as well as a casting vote in Committee.

The qualification for the representative of a parish is 50 acres of land, and for a representative of town of Roseau or Portsmouth, 50 acres of land or a messuage in the same town rented at £20 per annum.

Electors for a parish must possess 10 acres of the parish, or house or building to be rented at £4 per annum. For the towns of Roseau and Portsmouth, a house or building in the town worth £18 per annum, or £1 per annum for life out of any charged on lands or tenements.

The elected members of the Dominica Assembly send two members to General Legislature of the Leeward Islands.
