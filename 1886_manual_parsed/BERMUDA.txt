The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. It is stated that, in 1863, there were 358 sugar-works in operation. At the present time they number over 500. The produce of 1871 amounted to 53,800 hogsheads of sugar and 33,500 puncheons of molasses; in 1876, 37,848 hogsheads of sugar, and 24,001 puncheons of molasses. In 1881 the produce amounted to 52,236 hogsheads of sugar and 33,521 puncheons of molasses.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939; and although it is estimated that some 20,000 were carried off by cholera in 1854, the census of 1861 showed a total of 152,727 inhabitants. By the census of 1871 there were 162,042 inhabitants, of whom 16,560 were white and the remainder coloured and black; the natural increase having been checked by the migration to other West Indian Islands of large numbers of the labouring population. By the census of 1881 the population is returned at 171,860. Where so great a population exists, great industry is essential to enable the people to live. Thus, labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden.

From an early date, each of the 11 parishes into which the island is divided was presided over by a clergyman of the Church of England; but it was not till 1824 that the Bishopric of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, with British Guiana, was created. In 1842, upon the resignation of Dr Coleridge (the first bishop), British Guiana and the Leeward Islands were separated from the Windward, and constituted distinct sees.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1719, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30l. per annum from the College funds, and four Island Scholarships at 40l. per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or sons of natives. There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation endowed many years ago, which has been liberally supported by the legislature, and promises useful results. It has a staff of 7 university men as Masters, a Professor of Chemistry and Agricultural Science and a Professor of German. The average number of pupils is about 140. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish, to the N.E. of the island, was re-opened in 1882, after having been closed for several years. The number of pupils at the close of 1883 was 16. There are four Barbados Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, each of the annual value of 175l., tenable at Oxford or Cambridge for four years. Besides these scholarships there are grants in aid to the successful competitors for the Gilchrist scholarships of 75l. each per annum for three years.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1835 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1807) were combined with the Land Police, and a Corps of Writ Officers added to the Force. A Juvenile Reformatory was opened in April, 1883.

An inland Post was first set on foot in 1852; and has since been amalgamated with the Colonial Post Office. Through this office a letter may be sent to any part of the island, reaching its destination the same day, for 1d. the ½ oz. Money Orders are granted to all parts of the world to which the English system extends.

A lunatic asylum and a lazaretto are kept up at the public expense: and there is a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the support of which the colony contributes 6,630l. per annum.

The deposits in the Savings Bank amounted, on 31st December, 1884, to 56,543l. The number of depositors was 6,300. Branch savings banks have been opened in the rural districts.

There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados.

The island forms the head-quarters of Her Majesty's forces in the West Indies command, under a major-general, who resides in Barbados. The troops stationed in the island are garrisoned at St. Ann's, situated at the southern extremity of Bridgetown.

Volunteer rifle, artillery, and yeomanry-cavalry corps were organized in 1859, but were disbanded in 1868.

The colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible Government. The Crown has no more than a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the appointment and control of public offices. The Government consists of a Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of nine members appointed by the Queen, and a House of Assembly, having twenty-four members elected annually on the basis of a very low franchise. The qualification of members and electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, which became law in April, 1884, and which repeals all previous legislation on the subject. By this Act a very liberal extension of the franchise has been granted, and it is estimated that almost 4,200 electors will be registered under its provisions, the number previous to its enactment being 1,793. The executive part of the Gov't. consists of the Governor, Officer conn. troops, the Colonial Secretary, th. General ex officio, and such other nominated by the Queen, one r. Legislative Council, and four, House of Assembly nominated. This body is called the Execut. introduces all money votes, pr.
and initiates all Government measures. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Tobago, but in 1865, by Royal Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands, and made a distinct Government.

BERMUDA.

General Description.

The "Bermudas" or "Somers' Islands" form a group or cluster of about 100 small islands, situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 32° 15' N., and long. 64° 51' W., about 580 miles to the eastward of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the nearest point of the neighbouring American Continent. The distance from Liverpool is about 2,900 miles, from Halifax in Nova Scotia 730, from New York 677, and from the nearest of the West Indian Islands about 800 miles.

These islands were discovered in the year 1515, by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudes, after whom they were called The Bermudas. The Spaniards
However took no steps to form a settlement on the islands, and they were still entirely uninhabited when, in 1609, Admiral Sir George Somers' ship, "The Sea Venture," while on a voyage with a fleet of eight other vessels, conveying a party of colonists to the new plantations then being formed in Virginia, was wrecked upon one of the numerous sunken reefs which surround the islands on every side. The reef is still called after the name of the Admiral's ship, The Sea Venture Flat.

Sir George Somers died in Bermuda the following year, and his companions, ignorant possibly of the prior claims of Juan Bermudes, called the group after him, "The Somers' Islands." The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land taken home by Somers' nephew, Captain Mathew Somers, induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their Charter, so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I; but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of 2,000l. to a new body of adventurers, called "The Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers' Islands," and thenceforward, for a considerable time, the islands bore the name of the Admiral who had led thither the first body of settlers. Gradually, however, the old name obtained the preference, and now the group is generally known as the Bermudas, though still sometimes called the Somers' Islands.

The Bermudas may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sand hills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 10 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width—and, generally speaking, it is considerably less. The wide expanse of enclosed water which it encircles is broken up and diversified by numberless smaller islands and sunken reefs, and ledges of coral, which render the internal navigation extremely intricate and dangerous to all but experienced pilots.

In former days some of what are now known as sunken reefs were probably islands, which have been undermined or washed away by the action of the sea. A solitary rock, called "The North Rock," now worn away to a mere column a few feet thick, and about twelve feet high, rising from a widespread submerged stone plateau in the midst of the Northern Reefs, is all that remains at present of an island that is shown on ancient maps as "Old Bermuda."

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern, and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral.

The islands are said to be as numerous as the days of the year, but not more than one hundred of them deserve the name of islands, the others are mere rocks: even of the one hundred enumerated not more than fifteen or sixteen are inhabited, the remainder being of inconsiderable size. The largest island, generally known as The Main Island, is about fourteen miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land. All the other islands taken together measure about 3,000 acres. The town of Hamilton, now the seat of Government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms as safe and convenient harbour for the small vessels which suffice to carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the transfer of the seat of Government to Hamilton, is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as a harbour of refuge by merchant vessels during the stormy periods which so frequently recur in the Western Atlantic at certain seasons of the year. Presenting, as it does, a wide area of landlocked water, with good holding ground, and a depth sufficient for all ordinary merchant vessels, and being easy of access from the ocean, with which it communicates direct, instead of opening as does the harbour of Hamilton into an enclosed inland sea, the harbour of St. George is, frequently crowded during the winter months with large merchant vessels and steamers, seeking shelter during bad weather, or requiring repairs after storms, or in want of supplies of fresh water, or of coal, or provisions.

The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island, standing by itself in the centre of the inland waters, and entirely given up for the accommodation of Her Majesty's Dockyard and a number of other naval establishments. Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, are now exclusively occupied by military depots and garrisons; Somerset, Smith's, St. David's, Cooper's, Nonsuch, Rivers, Ports, and Godets, are all inhabited by a civil population. The islands form an almost continuous chain: and with the exception of one break between Somerset and Watford Islands, there is uninterrupted communication by roads and bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset—Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island—a distance of about 22 miles.

The climate has been long celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. There is no winter, the thermometer never falling below 40 deg. of Fahr., and the summers are never very hot, the thermometer rarely rising above 85 deg. The summer heat too is generally tempered by a pleasant sea breeze. The islands produce a cedar wood of great beauty, and durability, well adapted for the use of the shipbuilder or the house carpenter, and the finer grained specimens are much in request among cabinet makers for articles of ornamental furniture.

Trade and Agriculture.

In former days the inhabitants of Bermuda gave themselves up almost entirely to maritime pursuits. Numerous small vessels, of from 200 to 300 tons burden, built by the islanders themselves, of their native cedar, traded between the West Indies and Demerara, and the United States, and the British colonies of North America, conducting a very profitable carrying trade between all these countries. Later they extended their voyages, carrying the salt fish of Newfoundland to Italy and Portugal, and taking back the Port wine for which Newfoundland became celebrated, or running down to Madeira or Ascension to meet the homeward bound Indian fleet, and taking back cargoes of tea or other Indian and Chinese products to be distributed along the American seaboard.

But the repeal of the British navigation laws, the introduction of steam, and the very general substitution of iron for wooden ships, gradually destroyed the carrying trade which had been so
profitable to Bermuda, and now the little maritime
fleet may be said to have ceased to exist, and the
industry of the islanders is entirely confined to
turning to account the small quantity of agricul-
tural land which they possess.

The soil of Bermuda may be described generally
as being poor in quality. Of the 12,000 acres com-
prised in the whole group, not more than 1,000
acres can be said to consist of good or fertile soil,
another 1,000 acres may perhaps be described as
fair, and a third 1,000, though poor and of no depth,
may still be cultivated with profit in favourable
years; but the remaining 9,000 acres can never
repay the expense of cultivation, consisting as they
do of very hilly and stony ground, partially covered
with a scanty herbage and a scattered growth of
stunted cedar trees, or of widespread brackish
marshes overgrown with coarse grass, rushes and
mangrove jungle.

But the climate combined with the geographical
position of these islands, in some measure com-
pensates for the smallness of the area of fertile
ground. There being nothing to fear from winter
frosts, the ground can be sown and planted at any
time from the end of August to the end of March,
and the crops can be gathered and shipped off to
New York in the months of April, May, and June,
when the corresponding American produce has as
yet scarcely shown itself above ground, and the
Bermudians, taking advantage of this peculiarity
of their climate, raise very large crops of early
potatoes, onions, tomatoes and beetroot, with
which they keep the New York market sup-
plied at a time when those vegetables cannot be
obtained from any other quarter, and thus com-
mand very high prices for their produce, and are
enabled to maintain their families in comfort upon
comparatively small portions of ground.

Very little use is made of the soil in Bermuda
after the spring crops have been grown; a few
melons, pumpkins, or sweet potatoes may be raised
here and there, but by far the greater part of the
ground is allowed to remain idle during the hot
summer months; anything that could then be
grown in Bermuda can be imported so much more
cheaply from America, that it never pays a Ber-
mudian agriculturist to produce it. Very little
also of the spring produce of the islands is con-
sumed by the inhabitants: it is too costly; nearly
all the early vegetables raised in Bermuda are
exported, and the whole population, civil and
military, depends for its subsistence upon food
supplies obtained from abroad. All the bread and
meat, and nearly all the vegetables consumed in
the islands, are imported from New York, and all
the food, horses, and cattle are brought from that
or other quarters. Bermuda being thus entirely
dependent upon America for its supplies of pro-
visions, any interruption to its intercourse with the
neighbouring continent would be certain to cause
great distress.

Government and Constitution.

Representative government was introduced into
the colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermudian
Company of London was annulled in 1684, and
since then the Governors have always been
appointed by the Crown, and the laws of the
colony have been enacted by a local legislature
consisting of the Governor, the Legislative
Council, and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by a Privy Council,
consisting at present of nine members named by the
Crown, the same nine members constituting the
Legislative Council. The House of Assembly con-
sists of thirty-six members, four of whom are
elected by each of the nine parishes. There are
854 electors, the electoral qualifications being the
possession of freehold property of not less than
60l. value. The qualification for a member of the
House of Assembly is the possession of freehold
property rated at 240l.

The Naval Station.

The importance of the Bermudas as a naval
station began to be felt towards the end of
the last century, during the wars which we had
to wage first with the revolted provinces in
America, and afterwards with the French and
Spaniards.

It was more fully recognised during the short
war between England and the United States in
1812, and is now universally acknowledged.

The position of the islands, situated in mid-ocean,
at almost equal distances from the West Indies,
the eastern seaboard of the United States, and the
Dominion of Canada, including our great naval
station at Halifax, presents many advantages for the
establishment of a Naval Station in the Western
Atlantic, and the peculiar conformation of the
group affords special facilities for the creation of a
naval depot and fortress of the first class. A
broad and almost continuous barrier, formed of a
succession of islands and sunken coral reefs, and
measuring about 50 miles in circuit, encloses an
internal oval area of about 120 square miles of
water, access to which from the outer ocean can
only be gained through a few long narrow tortuous
channels in which are interspersed not a few
clusters of sunken coral rocks. Ireland Island—
which contains Her Majesty's dockyard and the
other naval establishments—occupies rather a
central position in the midst of this enclosed sea,
so that a hostile cruiser cannot approach on any
side within five miles of it without having
first made its way through the encircling reefs, and
even when that great obstacle is surmounted, the
approach to the dockyard is still difficult and
dangerous, for the enclosed inland sea itself is
thickly studded with irregular groups, and banks,
and clusters of sunken coral reefs, which leave only
a few narrow channels that can be traversed with
safety by vessels of any considerable size.

The principal channel through the outer reefs,
the only one that is now used by merchant vessels,
and the only one that is safe for large ships, is
that which is called "The Narrows," which sweeps
round the northern and eastern sides of St.
George's Island, at a distance of about half-a-mile
from the shore. This channel is about two miles
in length, and is very narrow and intricate, so
that vessels must move through it very slowly and
with great caution. It is commanded throughout
its whole length, as are also the approaches to it
from either side, by numerous batteries mounting
very heavy guns behind casemated iron shields.
In war time the channel would also be defended
by torpedoes or submarine mines. As a naval
station therefore Bermuda may almost be con-
sidered to be beyond the reach of any attack.

From the year 1844 to the resignation of the See
of Newfoundland by Bishop Kelly in 1877, the
Bermudas were attached to the episcopal diocese of
Newfoundland. They then remained for some
time without a Bishop, but in 1879 the present
Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Reverend
Llewellyn Jones, was elected Bishop of Bermuda,
as a general rule it is anticipated that he will spend every second winter in these islands.

The islands are divided into nine parishes, of which the parish of Saint George's constitutes a living by itself, the remaining eight parishes being divided into four livings, of which each incumbent resides in two parishes. There is also an episcopal extra-parochial church in the town of Hamilton.

The Wesleyans, the Presbyterians and the Roman Catholics have erected several chapels in Bermuda, and the Episcopal Methodists have recently made some progress among the people; yet 70 per cent. of the white, and about 65 per cent. of the coloured population still belong to the Church of England.

Tariff.

The Customs Tariff which is passed yearly in June in the "Annual Supply and Appropriation Act," is as follows:

Arrowroot, unmanufactured, the 100 pounds ........................................... 0 10 0
Arrowroot, manufactured, the pound ......................................................... 0 0 6

Irrespective of the foregoing duty on spirits, there is levied on each cask or other package containing alcohol, arrack, brandy, cordials, gin, peppermint water, rum, shrub, or whiskey, landed in the islands, the sum of six pence, and no drawback of this tax is allowed.

On all goods imported, except articles subject to specific duties, and those enumerated in the following table of exemptions, and such books as, under the Act entitled "An Act to Regulate the Importation of Books and to Protect the British Author" are subject to an import duty of 15 per cent.—five per cent. ad valorem.
