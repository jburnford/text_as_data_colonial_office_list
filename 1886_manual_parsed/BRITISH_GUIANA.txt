BRITISH GUIANA.

This Colony is a portion of the South American Continent, extending from east to west about 200 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice, and is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyn, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and northeast by the Atlantic Ocean.

The territory was first partially settled by the Dutch West India Company in 1580. It was from time to time held by Holland, France, and England. It was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, to whom it was finally ceded in 1814.

It is impossible to specify the exact area of the Colony, as its precise boundaries between Venezuela and Brazil respectively are undetermined, but it has been computed to be about 109,000 square miles.

Constitution.

Under the Dutch, Demerara and Essequebo constituted one Government, and Berbice another, an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1732; under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six; any vacancy occurring being filled by the Governor's selection of one out of two nominations submitted by the remaining councillors. In the year 1817, however, an order was made by the Prince Regent in Council, requiring three nominations to be made in lieu of two for the Governor's selection, and also declaring that if no such nomination were made in fourteen days, the Governor should be entitled to appoint absolutely to the vacancy. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Demerara appears to have been established in 1773. In 1789 that for Essequebo was merged into it, and the seat of Government for the United provinces was established at Stabroek, the site of the present capital Georgetown. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government, and the West India Company, as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1788, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution), was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government, established a new one for the conjoined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation, notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and in 1802, and its cession in 1803; the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before. It is, therefore, advisable now to advert to the leading provisions of that document.

The Council or Court of Policy was to consist of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequebo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequebo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequebo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

The unofficial Members were to be chosen "from among the principal, most capable, and most religious inhabitants, above twenty-five years of age, professing the Protestant religion, and perfectly acquainted with the Dutch language, and who had resided at least three years within the Colony."

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each Colony, each consisting of seven Members, elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the Office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned, or ceased to be an inhabitant. The Kiezers, before proceeding to a nomination, were to be sworn to the faithful discharge of their office before the Director-General, a ceremony which continued to be observed until the passing of Ordinance No. 16 of 1864.

A periodical change in the constitution of the Council or Court of Policy was secured by providing that the Senior Colonial Member should retire yearly.

The Director-General was allowed a double vote, and the Secretary of Demerara was the "Minister of the Court of Policy."

Such seems to have been the original Legislative Constitution of the Colony. We now come to the occasion on which what are termed "Financial Representatives" were added.

It appears that in 1795 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds.† In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon thought fit to annul this arrangement, and to enact that to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation, in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of

* Demerara and Essequebo only are here alluded to.
† Beaujon's Procl., Loc. Guido.
Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proclamation remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when Sir Benjamin D'Urban became Governor of the United Colony, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

With an exception in regard to the franchise, to be noticed hereafter, this has been the usage and procedure till now, from which the inference has been drawn that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.*

The right of the Financial Representatives to exercise this power has, however, been strongly maintained by the Colonial Members upon all occasions, and this has led to collisions between the Executive and Elective section of the Court.† The position they assume is based upon the construction of certain passages in a decree of the State-General, dated 27th August, 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves," and in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1793, "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a great number of the Colonists, for example the 'Kiezers of both rivers,' and also upon the nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806. On the other hand, it has been contended that these minutes do not bear out the claim of right which has been founded upon them, since the evidence throughout seems to proceed upon the assumption that due provision has been previously made for the Sovereign's Chest, which is represented by the modern Civil List.

The principle of the whole system of Government is centralization. Until the year 1826, there existed not even local subdivisions of the Colony. Demerara and Essequebo were then divided into ten Parishes, and the same process was subsequently applied to Berbice. This arrangement, however, was simply ecclesiastical, involving no civil authority or jurisdiction.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated, but the principle has not been materially extended in its application, although some advance has been made.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Philip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty. Since that time no legislation has been attempted in the same direction except the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution may be summed up very briefly.

* During the discussions on the Civil List in 1848-9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governor the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.

† Proceedings relative to the Functions of the Financial Representative, 1832.

It consists of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly are performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which are dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passes all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which is passed by the Combined Court.

The Court of Policy is composed of five official and five elective members. The official members are the Governor, the Attorney-General, the Government Secretary, the Auditor-General, and the Immigration Agent-General. The elective members are chosen as follows:—When a vacancy occurs the College of Electors meets and submits to the Court of Policy the names of two persons, from whom one is selected by the Court.

The elective franchise is regulated by Ordinance No. 15 of 1849. The Colony is divided into five Electoral Divisions, each of which has its representative in the College of Electors, chosen for life or during permanent residence in the Colony, and one or more Financial Representatives, elected for two years, and eligible for re-election.

| Electoral Division | Representatives | Registered Electors at 31st Dec., 1884 |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| County of Demerara | 1 College of Electors | 1 Financial | 139 |
| City of Georgetown | 2               | 1               | 634 |
| County of Essequebo | 2               | 2               | 364 |
| County of Berbice | 1               | 1               | 85 |
| Town of New Amsterdam | 1               | 1               | 84 |
| Total             | 7               | 6               | 1,306 |

In the Colony of British Guiana the Roman Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by Orders in Council and local Ordinances; the Criminal Law is now based on that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that there is no Grand Jury.

Industry and Productions.

The staple products of British Guiana were in former years sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, and coffee, but the cultivation of the two last-named articles has for many years past been almost entirely abandoned. The soil of some parts of the Colony is however still capable of producing coffee of rare excellence. The Berbice River coffee was once much prized; but these two industries have now given place to the cultivation of the sugar-cane, which at present is the chief industry of the Colony, and furnishes nearly ninety-two per cent. in value of its exports.

The forests of British Guiana abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of articles of household furniture.

There were 105 sugar estates in active operation in British Guiana in the year 1884, having an aggregate of sugar cane cultivation of 79,502 acres, and of plantain cultivation of 2,553 acres. The sugar crop for 1884 yielded about 110,000 hogsheads; the bulk of the production is the high class sugar known as Demerara crystals.
Further attention is being given to the planting of coffee and cocoa on the vegetable soils to the rear of the cane grove; and several abandoned coffee estates are being reclaimed. Rice is now grown to a considerable extent on the Coolie Settlement at "Huist Dieren," and by Free Coolies on the Savannah lands behind the Sugar Estates. The great extension of sugar cultivation is due to the enlarged labour supply; and labour alone is wanted to extend this cultivation almost without limit.

Climate.

The climate of British Guiana is hot, but not unhealthy. The mean temperature throughout the year is about 82° Far. The heat is greatly tempered by the cooling breezes from the sea, which prevail during the greater portion of the year. The heat is felt more in August and September than at other times, owing to the partial cessation of these breezes.

Capital.

The capital city of British Guiana is Georgetown, situated in lat. 6° 49' 24" N., and long. 58° 11' 30" W., and possessing a population of upwards of fifty thousand souls.

Mail Communications.

The regular periodical mail communication the Colony is maintained by the vessels of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which leave Southampton every alternate Thursday. There are other lines of steamers trading to the Colony which carry mails, but their periods of departure are uncertain.

Tariff.

The Customs Tariff is regulated by Ordinance No. 9 of 1885.

BRITISH HONDURAS.

British Honduras is a colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the rapids of Gracias a Dios on the River Sarstoon, to Garbutt's Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier—being the western boundary, as defined by the Convention of 1859 with Guatemala—on the south by Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, by adventurers, who were attracted by the fine timber (logwood and mahogany) which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers.

From that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants, aided by a ship of the Royal Navy, the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms; and treaty after treaty was concluded, which had little other effect than to stimulate the enterprise of the settlers by the recognition, thus step by step accorded, of the footing they had gained for themselves in Central America, without, in the first instance, any thought of territorial aggrandisement, but solely in pursuit of the industry in which their fortunes were embarked.

Such, in brief, is the political history of the settlement in its earlier days, and the only subsequent events of external significance which need here be noticed, are the definition, as above, of its general boundaries (of which a survey has been partially executed); the frequent border troubles, connected with the revolt of the Indian population of Yucatan against the Spanish inhabitants, the result of which has been that the Indians are now de facto in possession of the country to a considerable distance north of the Hondo; and the quarrels of the Ycaiche and Santa Cruz tribes of Indians, in which it has been involved.

In response to a memorial from the inhabitants, and as a matter of internal regulation, it was determined in 1861 to place the settlement in every respect on the footing of a colony, though subordinate to the Government of Jamaica, from which it is distant about 660 miles.

A commission was accordingly issued to the officer then administering the Government of Jamaica (Mr. Darling), appointing him to be Governor, and to Mr. Scymour, the then Superintendent, appointing him to be Lieut.-Governor of the Colony of British Honduras; these arrangements taking effect from the 12th of May, 1862. By letters patent, bearing date the 2nd Oct., 1884, the officer administering the government was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of the colony of British Honduras, thus severing the relationship which had formerly existed with Jamaica.

The Constitution of the Colony was regulated by a local Act of 1870. By this enactment, a Legislative Council was established, consisting of five official, and not less than four unofficial members, to be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Lieut.-Governor, subject to Her Majesty's approval. The official members are the Chief Justice, the Colonial Secretary, the Senior Military Officer (if of or above the rank of major), the Treasurer, and the Attorney-General. The Lieut.-Governor is President of the Council.

There is also an Executive or Privy Council, consisting of the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General. (If below the rank of major the Senior Military Officer ranks last.)

The area of the Colony is 7,562 square miles, including Albion Island in the River Hondo, (about 26 square miles), and the Cays, 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. In its physical outlines it resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached, from the Savannah, through the Pine Ridge, the Cahoon Ridge, and the Forest, to the central mountain zone.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockcomb Mountains a height of some 4,000 feet is attained. That district of the Colony remained until 1879 wholly unexplored, when it was traversed by the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Fowler, from Garbutt's Falls on the Belize River, at the western frontier, to the sea coast south of Deep River. The country proved to be a succession of valleys and hills, from 1,200 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The westerly portion was an open undulating grassy country, forming magnificent pastureage lands. Towards the coast it was all forest, which was full of valuable timber. No inhabitants were seen, but ancient Indian ruins, consisting of large stone buildings, were discovered. Game abounded in places, whilst in others no sign of any form of animal life was met with. The soil generally was rich, but a few rugged spots were encountered. Some fine gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered, and other indications of minerals were noticed.

The Pine and Cahoon Ridges afford abundant pastureage for cattle, and the higher grounds would doubtless produce, at altitudes varying from 600 to 2,000 feet, as marketable a quality of coffee as any that is brought for export from the neighbouring Republics. For the present, however, and until more capital and labour shall have been introduced, and in the absence of roads, it is to the rich virgin soil of the valleys and lower plains that the settlers must look for remuneration from their agricultural pursuits. Upon this soil the most luxuriant crops of sugar are being grown from cane that will ratoon for years.
There seems to be no tropical product to which the climate and soil are not adapted. In the forests and wilds are found the cedar, rosewood, bullet-tree, fustic, lignum vita, sapodilla, Santa Maria, ironwood, red and white pine, india-rubber and gutta-percha trees, and the sarsaparilla, cochil neal-cactus, Agave or Pita, indigo, and many other useful plants or shrubs. The cocoanut flourishes, as does the Cahoon palm and the ground-nut, locally known by the name of Pinder (Arachis hypogaea), so extensively grown in and exported from Western Africa, which produces an oil equal to olive oil for domestic purposes, and is also excellent as fodder for horses and cattle; and there are the usual varieties of tropical fruit, cereals, and vegetables, plantains, maize, yams, casava, cocoa, and tobacco, to contribute to the food and enjoyment of the people.

The cultivation of fruit (bananas and plantains), and its shipment to New Orleans, is gradually extending, and proving remunerative to planters. Fruit trees, spices, and cocoa are being planted, and promise a new field of development.

The climate, though damp, is, for the tropics, healthy. Visitations of malignant fever or cholera are of rare occurrence, and an equable temperature, with a prevailing sea-breeze, is experienced throughout the greater part of the year.

Land may be purchased from the Crown at 4s. the acre.

I. The Dominion.—Incorporation, Statistics, Tariff, and Establishments.

II. The Provinces—Old Canada (Ontario and Quebec).
   Nova Scotia.
   New Brunswick.
   Manitoba.
   British Columbia.
   Prince Edward Island.
   The North-West Territories.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, were by the Imperial Act 30 Vic., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 27th of May, 1867. The Act, amongst other things, provides as follows:

Canada shall be divided into Four Provinces, named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.

The parts of the Province of Canada (as it exists at the passing of this Act) which formerly constituted respectively the Provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, shall be deemed to be severed, and shall form two separate Provinces.

The part which formerly constituted the Province of Upper Canada shall constitute the Province of Ontario; and the part which formerly constituted the Province of Lower Canada shall constitute the Province of Quebec.

The Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall have the same limits as at the passing of this Act.

III.—EXECUTIVE POWER.

The Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.

The Provisions of this Act referring to the Governor-General extend and apply to the Governor-General for the time being of Canada, or other the Chief Executive Officer or Administrator for the time being carrying on the Government of Canada on behalf and in the name of the Queen, by whatever title he is designated.

There shall be a Council to aid and advise in the Government of Canada, to be styled the Queen's Privy Council for Canada; and the persons who are to be Members of that Council shall be from time to time chosen and summoned by the Governor-General, and sworn in as Privy Councillors, and Members thereof may be from time to time removed by the Governor-General.

The Command-in-Chief of the Land and Naval Militia, and of all Naval and Military Forces, of and in Canada, is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.

Until the Queen otherwise directs, the seat of Government of Canada shall be Ottawa.

IV.—LEGISLATIVE POWER.

There shall be one Parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper House styled the Senate, and the House of Commons.

The Senate.

The Senate shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, consist of seventy-two Members, who shall be styled Senators.

In relation to the constitution of the Senate, Canada shall be deemed to consist of three Divisions:
1. Ontario;
2. Quebec;
3. The Maritime Provinces, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; which three divisions shall (subject to the provisions of this Act) be equally represented in the Senate as follows: Ontario by twenty-four Senators; Quebec by twenty-four Senators; and the Maritime Provinces by twenty-four Senators, twelve thereof representing Nova Scotia, and twelve thereof representing New Brunswick.

The Governor-General shall, from time to time, in the Queen's name, by instrument under the Great Seal of Canada, summon qualified persons to the Senate; and, subject to the provisions of this Act, every person so summoned shall become and be a Member of the Senate and a Senator.

Such persons shall be first summoned to the Senate as the Queen, by warrant under Her Majesty's royal sign manual, thinks fit to approve, and their names shall be inserted in the Queen's proclamation of Union.

If at any time, on the recommendation of the Governor-General, the Queen thinks fit to direct that three or six Members be added to the Senate, the Governor-General may, by summons, to three or six qualified persons (as the case may be), representing equally the three divisions of Canada, add to the Senate accordingly.

In the case of such addition being at any time made, the Governor-General shall not summon any person to the Senate, except on a further like direction by the Queen on the like recommendation, until each of the three Divisions of Canada is represented by twenty-four Senators, and no more.

The number of Senators shall not at any time exceed seventy-eight.
A Senator shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, hold his place in the Senate for life.

A Senator may, by writing under his hand, addressed to the Governor-General, resign his place in the Senate, and thereupon the same shall be vacant.

The House of Commons.

The House of Commons shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, consist of one hundred and eighty-one Members, of whom eighty-two shall be elected for Ontario, sixty-five for Quebec, nineteen for Nova Scotia, and fifteen for New Brunswick.

V.—PROVINCIAL CONSTITUTIONS.

Executive Power.

For each Province there shall be an Officer, styled the Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General in Council by instrument under the Great Seal of Canada.

A Lieutenant-Governor shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General; but any Lieutenant-Governor appointed after the commencement of the first Session of the Parliament of Canada shall not be removable within five years from his appointment, except for cause assigned, which shall be communicated to him in writing within one month after the order for his removal is made, and shall be communicated by message to the Senate and to the House of Commons within one week thereafter if the Parliament is then sitting, and if not, then within one week after the commencement of the next Session of the Parliament.

The salaries of the Lieutenant-Governors shall be fixed and provided by the Parliament of Canada.

Every Lieutenant-Governor shall, before assuming the duties of his office, make and subscribe before the Governor-General, or some person authorized by him, oaths of allegiance and office similar to those taken by the Governor-General.

The provisions of this Act referring to the Lieutenant-Governor extend and apply to the Lieutenant-Governor for the time being of each Province, or other the Chief Executive Officer or Administrator for the time being carrying on the Government of the Province, by whatever title he is designated.

The Executive Council of Ontario and of Quebec shall be composed of such persons as the Lieutenant-Governor from time to time thinks fit, and in the first instance of the following Officers, namely,—the Attorney-General, the Secretary and Registrar of the Province, the Treasurer of the Province, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works, with, in Quebec, the Speaker of the Legislative Council and the Solicitor-General.

The Constitution of the Executive Authority in each of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, continue as it exists at the Union until altered under the authority of this Act.

Unless and until the Executive Government of any Province otherwise directs with respect to that Province, the seats of Government of the Provinces shall be as follows, namely,—of Ontario, the city of Toronto; of Quebec, the city of Quebec; of Nova Scotia, the city of Halifax; and of New Brunswick, the city of Fredericton.

Legislative Power.

I.—ONTARIO.

There shall be a Legislature for Ontario, consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor and of one House, styled the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

The Legislative Assembly of Ontario shall be composed of eighty-two Members, to be elected to represent the eighty-two Electoral Districts set forth in the first schedule to this Act.

2.—QUEBEC.

There shall be a Legislature for Quebec consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor and of two Houses, styled the Legislative Council of Quebec, and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec.

The Legislative Council of Quebec shall be composed of twenty-four Members, to be appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor, in the Queen's name, by instrument under the Great Seal of Quebec, one being appointed to represent each of the twenty-four Electoral Divisions of Lower Canada in this Act referred to, and each holding office for the term of his life, unless the Legislature of Quebec otherwise provides under the provisions of this Act.

The qualifications of the Legislative Councillors of Quebec shall be the same as those of the Senators for Quebec.

The Legislative Assembly of Quebec shall be composed of sixty-five Members, to be elected to represent the sixty-five Electoral Divisions or Districts of Lower Canada in this Act referred to, subject to the alteration thereof by the Legislature of Quebec: Provided that it shall not be lawful to present to the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec for assent any Bill for altering the limits of any of the Electoral Divisions or Districts mentioned in the second schedule to this Act, unless the second and third readings of such Bill have been passed in the Legislative Assembly with the concurrence of the majority of the Members representing all those Electoral Divisions or Districts, and the assent shall not be given to such Bill unless an address has been presented by the Legislative Assembly to the Lieutenant-Governor stating that it has been so passed.

Every Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and every Legislative Assembly of Quebec, shall continue for four years from the day of the return of the writs for choosing the same (subject nevertheless to either the Legislative Assembly of Ontario or the Legislative Assembly of Quebec being sooner dissolved by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province), and no longer.

3.—NOVA SCOTIA AND NEW BRUNSWICK.

The Constitution of the Legislature of each of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, continue as it exists at the Union until altered under the authority of this Act; and the House of Assembly of New Brunswick existing at the passing of this Act shall, unless sooner dissolved, continue for the period for which it was elected.

VII.—JUDICATURE.

The Governor-General shall appoint the Judges of the Superior, District, and County Courts in each Province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Until the laws relative to property and civil rights in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and the procedure of the Courts in those Provinces, are made uniform, the Judges of the Courts of those Provinces appointed by the Governor-General shall be selected from the respective bars of those Provinces.

The Judges of the Courts of Quebec shall be selected from the Bar of that Province.

The Judges of the Superior Courts shall hold office during good behaviour, but shall be removable
by the Governor-General on address of the Senate and House of Commons.

VIII.—REVENUES; DEBTS; ASSETS; TAXATION.

All duties and revenues over which the respective Legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick before and at the Union had and have power of appropriation, except such portions thereof as are by this Act reserved to the respective Legislatures of the Provinces, or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by this Act, shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the public service of Canada in the manner and subject to the charges in this Act provided.

X.—INTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY.

Inasmuch as the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have joined in a declaration that the construction of the Intercolonial Railway is essential to the consolidation of the union of British North America, and to the assent thereto of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and have consequently agreed that provision should be made for its immediate construction by the Government of Canada: Therefore, in order to give effect to that agreement, it shall be the duty of the Government and Parliament of Canada to provide for the commencement, within six months after the Union, of a Railway connecting the River St. Lawrence with the City of Halifax in Nova Scotia, and for the construction thereof without intermission, and the completion thereof with all practicable speed.

XI.—ADMISSION OF OTHER COLONIES.

It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, on addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia, to admit those Colonies or Provinces, or any of them into the Union, and on address from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada to admit Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, or either of them, into the Union, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act; and the provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

In case of the admission of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, or either of them, each shall be entitled to a representation in the Senate of Canada of four Members, and (notwithstanding anything in this Act) in case of the admission of Newfoundland, the normal number of Senators shall be seventy-six, and their maximum number shall be eighty-two; but Prince Edward Island when admitted shall be deemed to be comprised in the third of the three Divisions into which Canada is, in relation to the constitution of the Senate, divided by this Act; and accordingly, after the admission of Prince Edward Island, whether Newfoundland is admitted or not, the representation of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the Senate shall, as vacancies occur, be reduced from twelve to ten Members respectively, and the representation of each of those Provinces shall not be increased at any time beyond ten, except under the provision of this Act for the appointment of three or six additional Senators under the direction of the Queen.

By Act of Canada, 35 Vict., ch. 13, the House of Commons consists of 200 Members, of whom 88 are from Ontario, 65 from Quebec, 21 from Nova Scotia, 16 from New Brunswick, 4 from Manitoba, and 6 from British Columbia.

The Governor-General of Canada was by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vic., cap. 3.

INCORPORATION OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16 May, 1871, issued under the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that province was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

The terms embodied in the Addresses and Order in Council giving effect to the Union are as follows:

1. Canada shall be liable for the Debts and Liabilities of British Columbia existing at the time of the Union.

2. British Columbia, not having incurred debts equal to those of the other Provinces now constituting the Dominion, shall be entitled to receive, by half-yearly payments in advance from the General Government, interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum on the difference between the actual amount of its indebtedness at the date of the Union, and the indebtedness per head of the population of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick ($27 77c.), the population of British Columbia being taken at 60,000.

3. The following sums shall be paid by Canada to British Columbia for the support of its Government and Legislature, to wit, an Annual Subsidy of $35,000, and an Annual Grant equal to 80 cents per head of the said population of 60,000, both half-yearly in advance, such Grant of 80 cents per head to be augmented in proportion to the increase of population, as may be shown by each subsequent decennial census, until the population amounts to 400,000, at which rate such Grant shall thereafter remain, it being understood that the first census be taken in the year 1881.

4. The Dominion will provide an efficient Mail Service, fortnightly, by steam communication between Victoria and San Francisco, and twice a-week between Victoria and Olympia, the vessels to be adapted for the conveyance of freight and passengers.

5. Canada will assume and defray the charges for the following services:
   A. Salary of the Lieutenant-Governor;
   B. Salaries and Allowances of the Judges of the Supreme Courts and the County or District Courts;
   C. The charges in respect to the Department of Customs;
