**Constitution.**

In New South Wales, "responsible Government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54. The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 3 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council now consists of 59 members.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880" (44 Vict. No. 13), consists of 122 members, representing 72 electoral districts; and provision is made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extends to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise is given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:—

1. "Resident Electors.—Every such subject who at the time of making out the Electoral List in any such District shall reside, and during the six months then next preceding shall have resided in that District.

2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession, or have been in the receipt of the rents and profits thereof for his own use of the clear value of 100l., or of the annual value of 10l. respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, ware-house, counting-house, office, shop, room, or building, being either separately or jointly with any land within such district occupied by him therewith of the annual value of 10l., such occupation being either continuously of the same premises or successively of any two or more respectively of the required value, or who shall hold, and for the said six months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district: Provided that no elector possessing more than one qualification within the same electoral district shall be thereby entitled to an additional vote for that district: Provided also when any premises are jointly owned or occupied or held on lease by more persons than one, each of such joint owners, occupiers, or leaseholders shall be entitled to vote in respect of such premises in case the value of his individual interest therein separately taken would, under the provisions of the said section, entitle him to vote if solely interested." (Section II.)

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Act of 1858 now repealed.

NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the Middle, and the South or Stewart's Island. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Colony: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles and the Auckland Isles. The entire group lies between 33° and 58° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles; the average being about 140 miles.

| Sq. Miles | Acres |
|-----------|-------|
| Total area of New Zealand is about | 104,000 or 66,560,000 |
| Viz., North Island | 45,687 or 29,240,000 |
| Middle Island | 57,313 or 36,680,000 |
| Stewart's Island | 1,000 or 640,000 |

It will thus be seen that the total area of New Zealand is somewhat less than that of Great Britain and Ireland.

Climate.

From its healthy and salubrious climate, from its great extent of coast line, and from its position with regard to the neighbouring continent of Australia, New Zealand is often called "the Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere." The temperature is, however, much more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington, nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin, nearly the same as at London. The official reports of the Medical Department show that whereas the annual mortality from all diseases out of every 1,000 British soldiers quartered in the United Kingdom was 16, it was only 5 out of every 1,000 in the troops quartered for more than twenty-five years in New Zealand.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was first visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders,
chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies. In 1840, the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, and the islands were erected into a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoan, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them have fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity appears to have been established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. It was estimated in April, 1881, that the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 44,097, all of whom dwell in the North Island, with the exception of 2,496 scattered over the other islands.

**Constitution.**

A constitutional form of Government was established in New Zealand by the Imperial Statute 15 and 16 Vic., cap. 72, passed in 1852. By that Act, the Colony was divided into six provinces, since increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounts to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vic., No. XXI., passed in 1875, the provincial system of Government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The Act provided that the abolition of the provinces should not have any operation until the day after the conclusion of the then next session of the Assembly, excepting that in the meantime Provincial Councils should not hold any meeting. Before the next Session there was a general election, and the first Session of the new Parliament ended on the 31st of October, 1876. Nothing was done during the Session to repeal the Abolition Act, and the provinces, therefore, ceased to exist the day after the Session concluded. The provincial system being abolished provision was made for the division of the country into counties, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, and consists of the Governor, of a Legislative Council, and of a House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Colony for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and hold their seats for life. The Members of the House of Representatives are chosen by Electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector is qualified to become a Member. The House of Representatives now consists of 95, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native Government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the Colonial Government. In 1864, the seat of the general Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

**Statistics**

The population of New Zealand on the 30th June, 1885, was estimated at 572,132, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 44,097 at the census taken in 1881.

The revenue, the trade, and the other elements of material prosperity have increased largely during recent years. Thus the revenue was in 1861, £691,464l.; and in the year ending 31st December, 1881, the total ordinary and territorial revenue was as follows:—Ordinary revenue, £3,280,115l.; territorial, £427,373l.; total, £3,707,488l. The population of the chief towns on the 3rd of April, 1881, was as follows:—Wellington (the seat of the general Government), 20,563; Dunedin, 24,372 (or, including suburbs, 42,794); Auckland, 16,664 (or, including suburbs, 30,952); Christchurch, 15,213 (or, including suburbs, 30,715); Nelson, 6,764. All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the colony up to 31st December, 1884, was valued at £49,457,495l.; and the annual production is now about one million sterling. The wool exported in 1884 amounted to 81,139,028 lbs., valued at £3,267,527l. In 1885 it amounted to 1,772,344 lbs., valued at £93,104l. The live stock in New Zealand in 1884 was:—Horses, 162,000 for 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 700,000; sheep, 14,056,266 for 11,704,853 in 1874. The number of acres under cultivation in February, 1885, was 1,291,565, exclusive of land laid down in grasses, the extent of which was 5,258,834 acres.

The system of Government Life Insurance has worked remarkably well. The last quinquennial examination was made in 1881, by eminent actuaries resident in England, and their report was highly satisfactory, showing that a large amount was available as a bonus to the insurers.

**Public Works Policy.**

In 1870, the Immigration and Public Works Act and cognate Acts were passed, and the policy contained in them may be shortly described as follows:—

The colony was to incur a liability, spread over a course of years, amounting to about ten millions, which were to be expended in specified proportions on the under-mentioned objects:—

1. Immigration.
2. Main railways throughout each island.
3. Roads through the interior of the North Island.
4. The purchase of native land in the North Island.
5. The supply of water on gold-fields.
6. The extension of telegraph works.
7. Miscellaneous public works.

The administration of these services was vested in the General Government, and the responsibility, subject to some exceptions in which its action depended on the previous concurrence of provincial authorities devolved on the General Government.
These exceptions have been abolished by subsequent legislation.

Since 1870, and up to the 30th of June, 1885, the Agent-General for New Zealand has despatched to the colony 111,948 souls.

Since its organization, the Public Works Department has constructed in the North and South Islands dray and horse roads to the extent of some thousands of miles, at a cost of £1,648,535l., including several hundred bridges, opening up nearly all parts of both islands for settlement, and a further amount of £399,595l. has been expended by the Lands and Mines Departments on roads to open up Crown lands and gold fields, making a total expenditure on roads of £2,048,130l.

It may here be remarked, that before the creation of the Public Works Department of the General Government, many thousands of miles of good and substantial roads had been constructed by the various Provincial Governments throughout the colony; and that since the Provinces have been abolished a very great deal of similar work has been carried out by the various County Councils and Road Boards in addition to what has been done by the General Government.

The construction of railways is still being proceeded with. On the 31st March, 1885, there were open for traffic throughout the Colony 1,477 miles of Government railways. There was a balance of profit on their working during the twelve months ending the 31st March, 1885, of £55,686l.; while the total expenditure on construction of the railways open for traffic to the same date had been £11,810,194l., thus showing a profit of 3l. 0s. 3d. per cent. on the whole outlay.

The length of railway opened for traffic is increasing at the rate of about 80 miles per annum.

The railway system of the colony is indicated in the accompanying map of the islands. Maps herewith.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point of the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the colony of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,838,080 acres.

The native animals are of the same orders as those of the other Australian colonies, the marsupials being represented by the kangaroo, wallaby, pademelon, opossum, &c., &c.

The birds comprise a small species of eagle, kites, hawks, cranes, the great kingfisher, or "laughing jackass," emus, plain and scrub turkeys, parrots of brilliant plumage, cockatoos, &c., while wild duck, snipe, quail, doves, and swans afford sport for the gun.

Fisheries: the coast waters, bays, and rivers abound with excellent fish for the table, the flesh of some of the varieties, such as the guard, whiting, sole, flathead, and silver bream being of great delicacy; while the deep-sea fish, viz., schnapper, king fish, Jew fish, albacore, and mullet resemble in firmness the cod and haddock of northern waters. The oyster banks not only supply the demands of the capital, but form an article of export to the southern colonies.

The dugong, a mammal inhabiting the bays, affords an oil which is much sought after for its curative properties in lung disease; and its hide, when cured, makes excellent belting leather. The turtle also is to be found in numbers in the northern waters of the Colony.

Physical Features and Products.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillers of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the 21st parallel of south latitude, and thence west to the western boundary, separating the rivers flowing eastward into the Pacific Ocean, and northward into the Gulf of Carpentaria, from those running westward and southward to the ocean, at the Great Australian Bight. Another range branches from the main range about lat. 21° south and long. 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

There are several mountain ranges of greater or less altitude between the main range and the eastern coast, forming the watersheds of numerous rivers and creeks, and enclosing extensive valleys, where excellent pasturage is found for the flocks and herds of the settlers, although the grasses are deficient in the fattening properties which distinguish the herbage of the tablelands of the western interior.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Cotton cultivation promised for some years to prove remunerative to cottier-farmers, but since the discontinuance of the land bonuses given by the Government for its production, and the fall in prices consequent upon the renewed supply from the United States of America it has rapidly declined.

Sugar growing is now becoming a very important industry. In 1884 there were 57,687 acres under cane, of which 29,930 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 33,361 tons of sugar, which may be roughly valued at $12,905.

Arrowroot is a description of crop which appears to be coming largely into favour with farmers. Nor is this surprising when it is considered that it requires very little more cultivation than maize, it is not subject to such loss from birds and granivorous animals and insects as the latter crop, and the manufacture is very simple. The manufactured article is portable and easily protected from loss or damage. There is also a world-wide market for it, and it can be held over for a favourable market without chance of loss or deterioration when once properly manufactured. No doubt it is a crop very exhausting to the soil, but farmers from year to year, profiting by experience, are more careful in keeping their land in good condition by higher cultivation and manuring. In 1883 the quantity of land under this crop was 227 acres 8 roods, which yielded 390,964 lbs.; while in 1884 there were 352 acres under arrowroot, which produced 574,768 lbs.; the estimated value of which was $11,304.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing
range of mountains is elevated table-land consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick, on the Darling Downs. In 1884 15,942 acres were planted with this cereal, principally in the localities mentioned. Out of the total area planted the produce of 716 acres only was mown for hay, 3,837 acres were totally unproductive, and 11,389 acres were reaped for grain, yielding 186,482 bushels. The season of 1884 was the best for wheat since 1880, rust not being nearly so prevalent as in the intervening years.

Agricultural and other Industry.

Agriculture in Queensland, though yet in its infancy, is gradually extending, and will no doubt continue to grow in importance with the steady increase of population.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the Colony, and from the suitability of soil and climate generally, and the great extent of the territory, this will no doubt continue to be the case.

There are 9,542 squatting "runs" or tracts of land containing 6,113,760 acres leased from the Government at a very low annual rental in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

In 1884 there were 247 new runs applied for, containing together 15,110½ square miles, or 9,670,880 acres. Application was made in the same year for 38 "unwatered runs," as they are termed, containing 2,320¼ square miles.

The right of lease to 125 runs was purchased at auction during the year from the Government, for £4,890/7s., at an average of 1l. 1s. 9½d. per square mile on the available area.

The average rate of rent per square mile on the available area of runs in what are called the settled districts of the country is 2l. 6s. 1l½d.

The importance of the pastoral interests will be seen by the value of the following exports of home products connected with this industry for the year 1884:

| Item                  | Value     |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Wool                  | £1,889,504|
| Hides and skins       | £109,291  |
| Tallow                | £76,019   |
| Horses, cattle, and sheep | £572,010 |
| Salted and preserved meat, &c. | £69,092 |

Total: £2,715,916

The above unfortunately show a considerable decrease on the previous year, owing to the excessive drought from which the Colony has been suffering.

Mining has proved a great source of wealth to the Colony. During the year 1884 the exports of gold and other metals are given as follows:

| Metal          | Value     |
|----------------|-----------|
| Antimony       | £10,968   |
| Gold           | £923,010  |
| Tin            | £228,457  |
| Copper         | £3,014    |
| Galena         | £1,110    |
| Silver ore     | £23,696   |
| Silver lead    | £1,060    |

Total: £1,191,815

The Gympie and Charters Towers gold fields still maintain large mining populations, and the yield from their reefs, although satisfactory, is not so favourable as would be the case if more scientific appliances were available for the extraction of the metal. During the year 1884 an important discovery of gold was made near Rockhampton, at a place called Mount Morgan. The find is undoubtedly a very rich one; but, being on private and not on Crown land, it is difficult to obtain reliable information as to the actual yield. The geological character of this goldfield is peculiar, the gold being found in a frothy porous sinter, so light that it floats in the water like pumice, and the fine gold is disseminated throughout the sinter which is supposed to have been deposited by a thermal spring. Another important discovery was made during the year 1880 in tin mining at Herberton, in the Cardwell district. The returns are very good, and already a large and apparently permanent township has sprung up in the locality. It is estimated that about 1,155,576l. worth of ore has been raised at that place. There are lead mines in operation at Ravenswood, the ore from which yields a good percentage of silver. There are also large deposits of gold in the district. Cinnabar, antimony, and manganese are also among the mineral products.

Near St. Lawrence, and on the adjacent islands, marble of fine grain is found, which at present finds no better use than being consigned to the lime kilns.

Timbers.

Valuable timber of various descriptions grows in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hardwood, which is most in demand: flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood," &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. Not long since a "Red Gum" beam, which lay on the ground under a wooden house more than 40 years old, lately pulled down in Brisbane, was found to be so hard that it took two men nearly a day with a new saw to cut it in two. The timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alsotoma constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the Eucalyptus is coming largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Many of the indigenous plants produce excellent fibre for textile and cordage purposes; and no part of the globe is better supplied with fodders, there

Beech and yellow wood are hard wood timbers.
There are also a few of the native fruits which would be worth cultivation, such as the Herbert River cherry, the Davidson plum, &c., &c.

Excellent coal has already been found in some localities, and new discoveries are being frequently made. There were 129,980 tons of this mineral raised during 1884, valued at £4,160l. At Burram, in the Maryborough district, splendid coal has been discovered, and a railway constructed to the spot, in order to bring the mineral to the Port of Maryborough. There are also other natural productions promising to add to the wealth of the Colony, but requiring labour and capital for their development.

**Population.**

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; the estimated population on the 31st Dec., 1884, was 309,913; and on the 30th June, 1885, 318,606.

There are above 225 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 26 are under Municipal Government, contain a population of about 101,000, and rateable property valued at £1,272,388l.

**The Metropolis.**

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, is beautifully situated on a fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, has a population of about 50,000. It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast. Although the heat in summer is great, the climate during the greater part of the year is healthy and enjoyable.

**Imports.**

The imports for the year 1884 were valued at £381,976l.

**Banks.**

There were 8 banks with 112 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £1,263,219l.; deposits, £322,025l.; note circulation, £33,083l. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 33,067, the amount of deposits as £220,614l.

**Railways.**

At the end of 1884 the railways in Queensland showed 1,207 miles in operation, the revenue being £30,631l. There were 74½ miles of railway in course of construction. The following lines are now open for traffic:—The Southern and Western from Brisbane to Dulvadilla; with its branches, Ipswich to Passiferr, Toowoomba to Warwick and Stanthorpe, and Toowoomba to Highfields; also a branch from Warwick to Killarney. An extension of the Western line is also in progress to Morven. There is a line open to Gympie and one also to Howard from Maryborough, which is about to be extended to Bundaberg. In the latter district the line is open from the township of that name to Mount Perry, a great copper mining centre.

The Central Railway is open from Rockhampton to Jericho.

The Northern Railway is open from Townsville to Pentland, having been carried past Charters Towers, the latter a town of about 10,000 inhabitants, and a great gold mining centre. This railway is now being extended to Hughenden, 23¾ miles into the interior. From all the above railways many branches are being constructed tending to open up the Colony. The trunk lines all start from the head of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard.

**Electric Telegraph Lines**

There are 221 electric telegraph stations in the colony. The number of miles of line, 6,980 with 11,300 miles of wire. The net revenue for 1884 was £74,897l., in addition to £31,764l., the value of work performed for the public service for which the department received no remuneration.

The number of messages despatched during 1884 was 1,122,544. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 440 subscribers who use it, and aerial cables containing multiple wires are about to be used to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street.

**Immigration.**

The European immigration for the year 1884 was 16,486. The arrivals from Hong Kong numbered 1,489, and from the South Sea Islands, 3,289; 3,026 immigrants from Europe were introduced entirely at the expense of the Queensland Government.

The land order system of immigration has been discontinued, the present liberal system of disposing of the public lands of the Colony being considered by the Legislature a sufficient attraction to the better class of immigrants from Europe likely to engage in pastoral and agricultural pursuits. A very extensive system of immigration direct from England was established by means of the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels in the latter part of the year 1881. These ships coming through the Suez Canal and via Torres Straits, enable the Government to distribute the immigrants carried by them at various ports on the eastern seaboard, where they are likely to obtain employment or wish to settle themselves. The arrangement saves much expense to the colony, and also tends to distribute the immigration more equally through all parts of Queensland, as far as the coast line is concerned. Notwithstanding the trying voyage of these vessels through the Red Sea at some periods of the year, the mortality is proportionately lower than that on board immigrant vessels coming by the long sea route. About 11,861 persons were brought to Queensland by the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels during 1884, the mortality amongst them being at the rate of 8·35 per 1,000.

**Lands.**

The several Acts of Parliament under which land may be secured are "The Pastoral Leases Act of 1869," "The Mineral Lands Act of 1882," "The Gold Fields Act of 1874," and the "Crown Lands Act of 1884."

"The Crown Lands Act of 1884" has superseded all former Crown Lands Acts, and is now the only statute which provides for the leasing or alienation of the Crown lands of the Colony.

It has been framed to bring about increased agricultural settlement and closer pastoral occupation of the waste lands of the Colony, and to contribute a more adequate return to the public revenue. Its principal aims are to encourage and substitute, as much as possible, leasing instead of selling, to prevent the aggregation of large estates, and to stop as far as practicable the system of "dumying." Its provisions apply to the whole Colony, but only specified parts will be operated on immediately. Its administration is to be by a Land Board consisting of two permanent members,
acting with the Minister for Lands for the time being.

Under this Act, portions of the runs at present held under former Pastoral Leases Acts, amounting to one-fourth, one-third, and even one-half, according to the length of the leases yet to run, will be resumed for sub-division; the balance may be held by the present lessees on certain terms, with longer leases than those under which they have hitherto been held.

Grazing Farms.

In the resumed portions, grazing farms may be selected in proclaimed districts, in areas of not more than 20,000 acres, nor less than 2,560 acres, at a rent to be fixed by the Land Board, not being less than 3s. 4d. per acre per annum. The proclamation opening the land for selection will declare the maximum area which may be selected in each district and the rent. When an application has been approved of by the Land Commissioner, and confirmed by the Board, a non-transferable licence will be issued for three years, and within that time a selector must enclose his farm with a substantial fence. At the end of this period, if the selector proves that he has so fenced in his holding, and performed the condition of residence, a transferable lease for 30 years will be granted him, at a rent to be determined every five years by the Land Board.

Agricultural Farms.

Suitable agricultural areas will also be proclaimed in which agricultural farms may be selected of not more than 1,280 acres, nor less than 320 acres, but any person may apply for and select any smaller area that is comprised in one complete surveyed block. The proclamation opening the land to selection will declare the maximum area which may be selected in any one district, will specify the lots and their areas, the rent, which is not to be less than 3d. per acre, and the purchasing price. A licence will be issued to the selector, who must within five years fence in the land or make permanent improvements of a value equal to the cost of the fence. When the conditions of residence and improvements are fulfilled, a transferable lease for 50 years will be granted, at a rent to be determined every five years by the Land Board. If the lessee can prove ten years continued residence, he will be entitled to purchase the holding at a price to be fixed by the Land Board, which will not be less than 20s. per acre.

Homesteads.

In the case of an agricultural farm of not more than 160 acres, if the lessee proves five years' residence, and an expenditure of not less than 10s. an acre on permanent improvements, he can secure the fee simple by paying such sum as shall, with the rent already paid, amount to 2s. 6d. an acre.

The Government will also conduct sales of land by auction in and near townships. The upset price of town blocks may be 8l. per acre, the size varying from one rood to one acre. Suburban lands within one mile from the town lands will be in lots from one to five acres; beyond again from one to ten acres, the upset price being 2l. per acre.

Of the 420,000,000 acres contained in the Colony, the total granted in fee-simple up to the end of 1884 was 7,099,275 acres, for which 4,850,109l. had been paid.

Government.

The Government of Queensland is composed of the Governor, appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, and an Executive Council, composed of the responsible ministers of the Crown. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected by the suffrages of the people. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The franchise is on the most liberal footing, every man of 21 years, who has resided as much as six months in one locality, having a vote. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 36 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act of 1878, and the Additional Members Act of 1885, the Colony is divided into 44 districts, of which 16 return two members, and 29 return one member each, or a total of 59 members. The most northerly district in the Colony, Somerset, is as yet unrepresented. Queensland became a Colony on 10th December, 1859, the territory having been separated from New South Wales on that date.
