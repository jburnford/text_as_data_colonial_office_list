An Act was passed by the Legislative Council, in 1875, authorising the construction of a railway from Pietermaritzburg to the Port of Durban, 78 miles, with a branch northwards from Umgeni to Verulam, 19½ miles, and one south to the Isipingo River, 7 miles. The estimated cost of the work, £1,200,000., was raised by loan; the contract was executed by Messrs. Wythes and Jackson. The first sod was turned by the Lieutenant-Governor on the 1st of January, 1876, and the line was finally completed and opened for traffic in November, 1880. A further extension to Ladysmith (118 miles), at an estimated cost of £1,350,000., is being constructed, and the whole will be finished and opened early in 1886. A contract for the work has been entered into with Mr. James Perry (since deceased).

Defence.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of 1884 consisted of 785 of all ranks.

There is also an armed and mounted police force, numbering 248 Europeans of all ranks, and 25 natives.

Missionaries.

There are various missionary establishments in Natal, supported by voluntary aid, for the advancement of the 362,000 Zulu-Kafir subjects of the Queen. The Churches of England and Scotland, the Wesleyans, the Dutch Reformed, the Americans, the Prussians, the Hanoverians, the Norwegians, and the Church of Rome, all have their stations.

NEWFOUNDLAND.

This island is situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 40,200 square miles. It was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries.

Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Sir Elizabeth, attempted to colonize this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634, a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and 20 years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was ceded to Great Britain, subject to certain rights reserved to France, which are still in question between the two nations.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, and mining—are confined altogether to the sea coast; but a railroad to extend from St. Johns through the island northerly, is at present under construction by an American company of capitalists, who have obtained a charter and large concessions of land from the local parliament; and it is hoped that this road will be the means of opening out and developing the unquestioned resources of the country.

Newfoundland was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council not to exceed 7 members, a Legislative Council not to exceed 15 members, and a House of Assembly of 33 members, elected by householders, who have occupied a dwelling-house as owner or tenant for 1 year immediately preceding the day of election. There are 19,883 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 17 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 6 return three members; 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding 500l. in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100l.* The ordinary duration of the Session is about three months, and it generally meets at the end of January.

Members of the Council and Assembly receive a certain fixed sum per session, which is provided for annually in a local Act.
