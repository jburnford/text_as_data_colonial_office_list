ST. VINCENT.

The Island of St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 85,000 acres of land. Some of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island.

The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from the mainland.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the bottom of an extensive bay, at the southwestern extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of 5,593 souls.

St. Vincent, though exhibiting some features in common with the other islands, is favourably distinguished from many of them by an undulating surface, and a succession of gentle slopes, of which portions are cultivated for sugar-cane. Its most striking peculiarity is its "Souffrière," or volcanic mountain, celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and is about 3,000 feet above the level of the sea.
At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands. The Caribs continued sole masters of St. Vincent until the year 1675, when a number of savages of a different race were discovered on it. These received the appellation of "Black Caribe," to distinguish them from the aborigines, to whom the name of "Yellow Caribs" was given.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 8,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £3,625l.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the Island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. It took place on the 10th of October of that year, and extended its ravages chiefly to St. Vincent, Grenada, St. Lucia, and Martinique. The plantations were destroyed, the houses thrown down, and the loss of human life in the four islands has been computed at upwards of 20,000 souls. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but then the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the Zebra sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British head-quarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. The success which had attended the British arms in the reduction of St. Lucia inspired the inhabitants of St. Vincent with hopes of a speedy deliverance, and they were not disappointed. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Rattan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

The planters who survived this protracted and deploring war found the Colony at its close in a sad state of destitution; and an application for relief to the Imperial Parliament by means of a loan, was favourably entertained. About this time Mr. Seaton resigned his post of Governor, and was succeeded by Mr. William Bentinck, who arrived in June, 1802. The new Governor was authorized to grant occupancies of the Carib lands, during the King's pleasure, to all those who had been engaged in the late war; and this was followed in 1804 by an Act declaring that the Caribs had forfeited all claim to their lands under the treaty of 1773, and these were consequently vested in the Crown.

In 1809, Sir Charles Brisbane was appointed Governor of St. Vincent, in which post he continued till his death, in 1829. During his administration an impetus was given to agriculture and trade which soon raised the Colony to an unexampled degree of prosperity.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of Coolie labourers in 1861. There are about 500 of these immigrants at present located on different plantations in the island.

There are seventeen churches and chapels belonging to the Established Church, three Roman Catholic, eleven Wesleyan, and one Presbyterian, churches.

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Council acted in the double capacity of a Privy Council and a Legislative Council. The Governor presided in the former, and the senior member, with the title of President, on whom also devolved the temporary administration of the Government on the death or absence of the Governor in the latter.

The Assembly was originally composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1843 the number of Representatives was increased to twenty-five, but by an Act of 1850 it was reduced to nineteen, as it originally stood.

In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor, and composed of three members, one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Committee held office during pleasure. Their duties were to advise and assist the Governor in the administration of the finances, and of the general affairs of the Colony; to act as a Board of Audit, and to have the charge of all Public Buildings; also to be the official organs of communication between the Governor and the Legislative Chambers. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years. On its expiring, in 1864, the Administrative Committee was not revived; but an Act was passed authorising the continuance of the Executive Council as a
Council of Advice to the Governor. This Council was composed of members from both branches of the Legislature, appointed by and removable at the pleasure of the Crown. From this Council the Governor selected, at pleasure, any two members, being members of the House of Assembly, to act as the official organs of communication between himself and the Assembly. The initiation of all money votes rested with these members, under the direction of the Governor, without whose assent, signified through one of them, no money vote could be taken. A separate and distinct office of Auditor of Public Accounts was at the same time created.

This constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony; and by Acts which received her Majesty's assent, and were formally proclaimed in the Colony on October 17, 1867, the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex-officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. It was presided over by one of its members appointed by the Crown, who had, in addition to his vote as a member, a casting vote upon an equality of votes.

The franchise was regulated by an Act passed and published concurrently with the Constitution Act. The qualification for electors was a freehold of 10l., a leasehold or tenancy of 20l., or an income of 50l. per annum. The number of electors registered under this law, for the year 1874, was only 388. Of these 166 claimed to vote on landed qualification, and 206 on income qualification.

But this Constitution, also, has been abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47), by which the future modelling of the Constitution was left to the Crown. By an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, Her Majesty has declared that the Legislature is to consist of the Governor for the time being, and such other persons, not fewer than three, as She may designate by instructions or warrant.

In 1868 the Executive Council Act was modified, and the Council may now be composed as the Crown may direct.

The several courts of the colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the colony is the sole Judge of this Court.

In 1834 the benefit of the Encumbered Estates Act was extended to St. Vincent; and in 1859 the Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands was inaugurated. This Court is composed of the Chief Justices of the Islands of Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, St. Lucia, Tobago, comprising the Government of the Windward Islands. The registration of all real property is required to be made in the office of the Colonial Registrar, who is also Secretary of the Courts, Registrar in Chancery and in Ordinary, and Clerk of the Crown.
