BAHAMAS.

History.

A chain of islands lying between 21° 42' and 27° 34' N. lat., and 72° 40' and 79° 5' W. long. The group is composed of about 20 inhabited islands and an immense number of islets and rocks. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Mayaguana, Andros Island, Great Bahama, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Crooked Island, Acklin Island, Long Cay, Cat Island, Watling's Island, now known as St. Salvador, the Berry Islands, and the Biminis.

St. Salvador, one of the islands composing this chain, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. The island of New Providence was granted by Charles II. to a proprietary body in 1670, and in 1671 Captain Johnson Wentworth was appointed by the proprietors to be their first Governor. It fell into the hands of the French and Spaniards in 1703, after which it became a rendezvous for pirates, who were extirpated in 1718 by the English, and a regular colonial administration formed. In 1781 the Bahamas were surrendered to the Spaniards, but at the conclusion of the war they were once more annexed by and finally confirmed to Great Britain, at the Peace of Versailles, 1783.

In 1848 the Turks and Caicos Islands were separated from the other Bahamas, and formed into a distinct Government, under the Government-in-Chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

Climate.

The climate is very pleasant and salubrious in the winter season, and the Colony has in recent years been much frequented by visitors from the United States and Canada—there being an excellent hotel, the property of the Government, but leased to private management, and carried on on the American system.

Trade and Industry.

There are eleven colonial custom-houses and ports of entry in the Government of the Bahamas, viz., Nassau, Abaco, Eleuthera, Harbour Island, Exuma, Rum Cay, Long Island, Long Cay, Inagua, Ragged Island, and Bimini. Considerable quantities of pine-apples, oranges, and sponges are exported, chiefly to England and the United States.

The pine-apple crop is very precarious.

The industry of salt raking has ceased to be remunerative, owing to the high protective duties imposed on salt by the United States.

Cocoa nut planting is now carried on extensively; this and other branches of industry received a fresh impulse under the patronage of Governor Robinson in 1874.

The sugar-cane grows luxuriantly in many of the islands, and is being more largely cultivated, the establishment of sugar mills having stimulated the planters to renewed exertions.

The Colony enjoyed great prosperity during the American Civil War, when it was the headquarters of many blockade running operations.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is conducted by the Governor, aided by an Executive Council of 9 members. The Legislative authority resides in the Governor, a Legislative Council of 9 members, and a Representative Assembly of 29 members. The qualifications of Electors are full age, a residence of 12 months of which six have been as a freeholder or housekeeper, or a residence of six months and a payment of duties to the amount of 26l. 0s. 10d. The qualification of Members is possession of an estate of real or personal property of the value of 200l. The Executive Council is composed partly of official and partly of unofficial Members. The members usually have a seat in one of the branches of the Legislature.

Tariff.

The Customs Tariff of the Bahamas is as follows:
