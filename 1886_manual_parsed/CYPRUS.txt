* Act 10 & 11 Vict., was repealed and re-enacted by Act 33 Vict., cap. 14. See also Act 33 & 34 Vict., cap. 102, and Circulars of 2nd Feb. and 23rd Sept., 1871, 9th March and 5th August, 1872, and 10th September, 1874.
this Country, with a view to the confirmation or remission of Sentences pronounced by the Colonial Courts. But Her Majesty's Government will be ready to afford any information, instructions, or advice for which the Governor may think it necessary to apply, whenever any question may arise on any criminal proceeding on which there may be any special and adequate motive for invoking the interference of Her Majesty's Government in this Country. Whenever a capital sentence shall have been executed, a report of it must be transmitted to the Secretary of State. (See Circular Despatch, 14th November, 1877.)

Every case should be reported to the Secretary of State in which, after sentence of death, a pardon is granted, or the capital sentence is commuted, or the commuted sentence is remitted. (See Circular Despatch of 5th May, 1882.)

408. Under the Act 12 & 13 Vict. c. 96, all persons charged in any Colony with offences committed on the Sea may be dealt with in the same manner as if the offences had been committed on waters within the local jurisdiction of the Courts of the Colony.*

409. The Act 6 & 7 Vict. c. 84, and 16 & 17 Vict. c. 118, provide means of apprehending offenders beyond the limits of that part of Her Majesty's dominions in which their offence was committed.

410. In order to secure the apprehension of any person in the United Kingdom under those Acts the following steps must be taken:—

1. A warrant must have been issued against the offender by some person having lawful authority to issue it in that part of Her Majesty's dominions where the offence was committed.

2. This warrant must be sent to England to be endorsed by the Secretary of State.

3. But the Secretary of State cannot endorse it until it is proved, by oath or affidavit, that the seal or signature is the seal or signature of a person having lawful authority to issue such warrant.

It is necessary, therefore, to send witnesses, or affidavits, or both, sufficient for such proof.

4. The warrant must have been issued upon depositions, and these depositions must be such as appear sufficient to warrant the committal of the offender for trial.

5. Sufficient evidence must be forthcoming in England before the Magistrate, to prove the criminality of the offender to an extent such as, if the offence had been committed in England, would have justified the Magistrate in committing the offender for trial in this country. But besides oral witnesses the Act 6 & 7 Vict. c. 84, enables the Magistrate to receive, in evidence, copies of the depositions upon which the original warrant issued, provided that they are certified under the hand of the person or persons who issued the warrant, and are attested upon the oath of the party producing them to be true copies of the original depositions.

If it is intended therefore to offer the depositions in evidence, instead of or in addition to oral testimony, they must be authenticated as above mentioned.

§ 2. Extradition Conventions.†

411. The Acts 6 & 7 Vict. c. 76, and 8 & 9 Vict. c. 120, give effect to the 10th Article of the Treaty of Washington between Great Britain and the United States, of the 9th of August, 1842, which provides for the mutual surrender of fugitives charged with the crime of murder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper.

412. The Acts 6 & 7 Vict. c. 75, and 8 & 9 Vict. c. 120, give effect to a Convention concluded between Great Britain and France on the 18th of February, 1845, which provides for the mutual surrender of fugitives charged with the crimes of murder (comprehending the crimes designated in the French Penal Code by the terms assassination, parricide, infanticide, and poisoning), or of an attempt to commit murder, or of forgery, or of fraudulent bankruptcy.

413. The Act 25 & 26 Vict. c. 70, gives effect to a Convention concluded between Great Britain and Denmark on the 15th April, 1862, which provides for the mutual surrender of fugitives accused or convicted of murder (comprehending the crimes of assassination, parricide, infanticide, and poisoning), or attempt to commit murder, or of forgery (comprehending the counterfeiting of bank notes or public securities or money), or of fraudulent bankruptcy.

414. Whenever a Governor may have occasion to exercise the powers conferred on him by these Acts, he must, immediately on the issue of his warrants for the apprehension and surrender of a Fugitive Criminal, transmit to the Secretary of State copies, duly authenticated, of the depositions under which such warrants may be granted.

* As to sentences proper to be passed in such cases, see the Colonial Courts Jurisdiction Act, 37 & 38 Vict., cap. 97.—Ed. C. O. L.)

§ 8. Apprehension of Deserters from Merchant Vessels.

415. The Act 15 and 16 Vict. c. 26 (1852) enables the Crown to carry into effect arrangements with foreign powers for the apprehension and surrender of seamen, not being slaves, who may desert from merchant vessels belonging to a subject of such powers when within Her Majesty's dominions.

§ 4. Disposal of Convicts.

416. By the Act 6 Geo. 4, cap. 69, the Queen in Council is authorised to appoint or to delegate to the Governors of the British Colonies respectively the power of appointing by proclamation the places to which convicts may be sent. But no such place is at present appointed, nor is any such delegation now in force.*

417. The Mutiny Act which is passed annually provides for the case of offenders who are to suffer penal servitude in virtue of the sentence of any court-martial held elsewhere than in the United Kingdom. The chief justice, or other judge, in any part of Her Majesty's foreign dominions, where such offender may be, on notice from the officer in command, or in his absence from the adjutant-general, is to make order for the immediate custody and penal servitude of the offender; and the Governor, on receiving notice of such order, is to cause such offender either to be removed, or to undergo his sentence in the colony, in obedience to the directions for the removal and treatment of convicts, which shall from time to time be transmitted from Her Majesty through one of her principal secretaries of state to each colony; and the offender is thereupon to be dealt with in the colony in which he has been sentenced, or to which he has been removed, as if he had been sentenced to be imprisoned with hard labour by a court of competent jurisdiction in each colony: and elsewhere out of Her Majesty's dominions, the officer commanding shall have power to make an order in writing for the penal servitude or intermediate custody of such offender, under which the offender may be imprisoned and kept to hard labour, and otherwise dealt with in the same manner as if he had been sentenced to be imprisoned with hard labour by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the place of his intermediate custody or punishment.

418. A form of order by the chief justice or other judge, approved by the law officers of the Crown, is inserted in the Appendix (see page 351), and an order in this form must be sent to England, or to the prisoner's destination, in the same conveyance with the prisoner, and a duplicate by the first opportunity.

419. Her Majesty's Government will provide for the charge of removal to this country, or to any colony or place, of such military convicts as may be sentenced to penal servitude by military court-martial, provided the convicts have belonged to the general establishment of the army, and not to local corps raised for the service of any particular colony.

420. If any advance has been made from the funds of the colony for expenses for the maintenance in gaol of military convicts under sentence of court-martial, prior to their removal from the colony, the Governor must apply for repayment of such expenses to the officer commanding the regiment to which the convicts may have belonged, by whom the details can be most correctly checked, and submitted to the military authorities at home.

CHAPTER XVII.

Presents.

421—1. Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, and all other Servants of the Crown in a Colony are prohibited from receiving Presents offered for their personal acceptance by Kings, Chiefs, or other Members of the Native population, in or neighbouring to such Colony.

422—2. When such Presents cannot be absolutely refused without giving offence, they are to be delivered up to the Government. To this rule there can be no exception, unless with the express sanction of the Secretary of State.

423—3. When Presents are exchanged between Governors or other Officers acting on behalf of the Colonial Government in ceremonial intercourses with Native Chiefs, Rulers, or others, the Presents received must be credited to the Government, and such return Presents, as may be sanctioned by the Secretary of State, will be given at the Government expense.

CHAPTER XVIII.†

Special Rules as to Leave of Absence, Passages, and Pensions of European Officers on the West Coast of Africa.*

§ 424. Subject to the necessities of the Service, and to the limitation laid down in § 430, European Officers under the rank of Governor or Administrator in the West Africa Settlements (Sierra Leone and the Gambia) may be granted six months' leave of absence, on full pay, after they have completed eighteen consecutive months of residential service.

In the Gold Coast Colony (Gold Coast and Lagos), six months' leave of absence on full pay may be granted after twelve consecutive months of residential service.

(a.) Officers who may be invalided before completing a tour of resident service cannot be granted any full salary leave. They may, however, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, be allowed leave on half salary not exceeding six months, and leave without salary for a further period of not more than three months before being called upon to resign.

(b.) Officers desiring leave, on the ground of "urgent private affairs," before completing a tour of resident service, may, if specially recommended by the Governor, be allowed leave without salary, or if they have completed six months' resident service, leave on half salary, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, but in no case exceeding four months.

* The 4th Section of the above Act is repealed by 33 Vict., cap. 10, which authorises the making of an arrangement between colonies for the detention and custody of colonial prisoners. Act 47 and 48 Vic., cap. 31, makes provision for the removal of prisoners from one colony to another or to the United Kingdom.—(Ed. C. O. L.)

† See Circulars 20th November, 1884, and 13th May, 1885.

‡ As to Governors and Administrators the following rule is now in force:—Sierra Leone and Gambia, 4 months on full pay after 20 month's resident service. Gold Coast and Lagos, 6 months on full pay after 20 months' resident service.—(Ed. C. O. L.)
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

(c.) Extensions on half salary of the ordinary West African leave can only be granted on medical certificate, and can in no case exceed three months. Any extension of leave granted on the ground of urgent private affairs must be without salary.

§ 425. They may further (in Sierra Leone and Gambia) be allowed two months' vacation leave, to enable them to proceed to Madeira or the Canary Islands once during each period of eighteen months' residential service, but such vacation leave must not be taken concurrently with leave of absence on full pay, and will not be granted unless the Officer quits the coast.

§ 426. The actual cost of their passages home and out again will be allowed to all Officers under the rank of Governor or Administrator who may be granted leave of absence under § 424.

§ 427. Officers whose salaries do not exceed 600l. a year, taking vacation leave under § 425, will have the actual cost of their passages from and to the Colony defrayed from Colonial Funds.

§ 428. The actual cost of passages to the West Coast will be paid on their first appointment to all subordinate Officers whose salaries do not exceed 600l. per annum.

Pensions, &c.

§ 429. The following exceptional advantages will be allowed. In all other respects the existing rules and limitations will be strictly applied:

1. The minimum term of service qualifying an Officer to receive a pension will be seven years, instead of ten.

2. For each year of pensionable African service there will be allowed in the pension one-fortieth (instead of one-sixtieth) of the Officer's salary; but no pension will exceed two-thirds of the retiring Officer's emoluments on the ordinary basis.

3. In cases of less than seven years' service the gratuity will be computed at the rate of 12½ per cent of the annual salary (instead of 8½ per cent.) for each year of service.

4. In the Service, for purposes of pension or gratuity, will be included all authorized leave, on full or half salary, excepting in the cases described in clause 102 of the Colonial Regulations.

5. Officers will be eligible for pension at the age of 55, which will also be the age when they may be required to accept their pensions and retire, unless their further continuance in the West African service is specially sanctioned by the Secretary of State.

§ 430. The above rules will take effect from September 18, 1874. Officers now serving on the West Coast of Africa will be allowed the benefit of them from that date, but their operation is not to be in any way retroactive. Neither do these rules apply to Officers either of whose parents was a native of the West Coast of Africa. They will continue to be subject to the rules hitherto in force in regard to leave of absence and pension. In the case of natives of the West Indies appointed to posts in West Africa special arrangements as to leave of absence and pension are made in each case.

CHAPTER XIX.

Interchange of Visits between Officers of Her Majesty's Ships and Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, Administrators, and Presidents of Colonies.

§ 431.—1. A Governor is to receive the first visit from all Naval Officers in command.

2. A Lieutenant-Governor is to pay the first visit to a Flag Officer or Commodore of the 1st Class, being a Commander-in-Chief, but to receive the first visit from all other Officers.

3. An Administrator or President is to pay the first visit to all Flag Officers or Commodores, but to receive the first visit from all other Officers.

4. Return visits are to be paid within 24 hours, and in person, to all Flag Officers, Commodores, Lieutenant-Governors, Administrators, and Presidents; but by an Aide-de-Camp or other Officer deputed by the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Administrator, or President, as the case may be, to all other Naval Officers.

5. Should the Governor or any other Officer administering the Government of a Colony find that from indisposition or pressure of important business he is unable to pay or return these visits in person, he will depute his Aide-de-Camp or some other Officer to do so. In like manner, should a Flag Officer or Commodore from indisposition or pressing occupation be precluded from paying or returning these visits, he will depute his Flag Lieutenant, or other Officer not below that rank, to do so. In each case the Officer failing to pay the required visit in person will report the circumstance, and assign the reasons which led to the omission, to the Department under which he is acting.

6. Officers acting temporarily in higher civil offices or commands are in respect to these visits to be upon the same footing as if they were confirmed in such offices or commands.

7. The Senior Naval Officers present will arrange, when necessary, to provide suitable boats to enable Governors, &c., to pay any official visits afloat, and to land them, on their notifying their wishes to that effect. (See also Circular, 7th March, 1879, enclosing the above Regulations.)

CHAPTER XX.

Use of Flags.

§ 432.—1. The Royal Standard shall be flown at Government House on the Queen's Birthday, and on the days of Her Majesty's Accession and Coronation.

2. The Union Flag, without the Badge of the Colony, shall be flown at Government House from sunrise to sunset on other days.

3. The Union Flag, with the approved Arms or Badge of the Colony, as shown in the drawing in the circular despatch of the 23rd August, 1875, emblazoned in the centre thereof, surrounded by a green garland, shall be used by Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, or Officers Administering the Government of Colonies or Dependencies when embarked in boats or other vessels.
4. The British Blue Ensign, with the Arms or Badge of the Colony emblazoned on the fly (as shown in the drawing enclosed in the circular despatch of the 23rd of August, 1875), and the pendant, will be flown by all armed vessels in the employ of the Government of a Colony.

5. The British Blue Ensign, with the Arms or Badge of the Colony emblazoned thereon, as described in the preceding section, but without the pendant, will be flown by vessels which belong to, or are in the service of, the Government of a Colony, but not armed.

6. All other vessels registered as belonging to one of Her Majesty's Colonies or Dependencies will fly the Red Ensign without any Badge.

7. Whenever a requisition is received by any Officer in command of one of Her Majesty's Ships for the embarkation or conveyance of a Governor, High Commissioner, Lieutenant-Governor, or Officer administering the Government of a Colony or Dependency, the Senior Officer present may direct the Special Flag of such official personage to be hoisted at the foretop-gallant masthead of the ship in which he is embarked; provided that he, after consultation with, and on requisition from, that official, considers it for the benefit of the service about to be performed that such flag should be hoisted, and provided that it is only hoisted or carried within the limits of His Government or High Commission in which he would be entitled to be saluted under Article 18, page 4, of the Queen's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, 1879.

8. If the Senior Officer considers it, in any circumstances, undesirable to hoist the Flag, he will inform the Governor, High Commissioner, &c., of his reasons, and will at once report the same to the Admiralty.

9. In the event of a Governor, High Commissioner, &c., of a Colony being detached on a Foreign Mission in his official capacity as Governor or High Commissioner, special instructions will be issued in each case as to the Flag which should be carried by a man-of-war in which he may be embarked; in the absence of which the Senior Officer present will exercise his discretion in consultation with the Official proceeding on the mission.

19. Computation, by the Auditor-General, of the pension, &c.

I Certify that the which may be paid to the applicant according to the Rules of the Colonial Service, amounts to and I base my certificate on the following calculation:

Instructions referred to on page

If this paper of particulars, and the certificates connected with it, be not sent in original, the copies must be duly attested.

Head 1 of Paper.—In the case of an Officer serving on the West Coast of Africa, a statement is to be added whether he is a native of that coast. (Colonial Regulations, § 430.)

Head 2.—State the description of allowance for which the applicant is recommended, viz., superannuation, compensation, compassionate allowance, or gratuity, and its amount. In the case of persons claiming an addition to their pensions in respect of professional or other special qualifications, this should be stated, and a reference should be given to the authority under which the claim is made.

Head 3.—If the service has been interrupted by one or more breaks, the word "broken" should be added before or after the number of years and months, and the causes, dates, and circumstances of the break or breaks should be stated under heading 9.

Head 4.—If the person retiring has been in receipt of the same salary, or in the class from which he retires, for the 36 months immediately before the date of his retirement, the actual annual rate of salary or wages at that date should be inserted, preceded by the word "actual." In other cases the average annual amount of salary or wages for the 36 months next preceding the date of retirement should be inserted, preceded by the word "average;" but if the whole period of service is less than three years, then the average for the whole period of service should be inserted.

Head 5.—A separate statement should be inserted of the average annual value, for the 36 months immediately preceding retirement, of each emolument (exclusive of salary or wages) which is claimed to be included in the calculation of the pension or gratuity.

Whenever the value of a house or house allowance, so ascertained, exceeds one-sixth of the salary and other emoluments which count for pension purposes, it is to be reduced to one-sixth of that amount, so that it shall not exceed one-seventh of the whole.

Fees which an officer is allowed to retain for his own use will be taken into account for pension purposes, with regular salary, at the annual average of the net receipts of the 36 months next preceding the officer's retirement. These net receipts are to be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of fees such office expenses, &c., as an officer may have had to defray from his own resources, in performing the services for which he was remunerated by fees. No deduction, however, from the fees should be made in respect of office expenses provided from public funds, for the due discharge of those duties to which a fixed salary is annexed. Papers of "particulars" when forwarded to the Colonial Department, should be accompanied by formal declarations from the retiring officers, showing the amount received by them for fees, and the amount defrayed as above for office expenses, &c., in each of the three years immediately preceding the retirement. It will be the duty of the Colonial Governments concerned to satisfy themselves of the accuracy of such statements before forwarding them to the Colonial Office. In the case of officers receiving fixed salaries and fees, the fees will not in ordinary circumstances be allowed to count for pension purposes to the extent of more than one quarter of the salaries; and fees will not in any case be allowed to count for pension purposes during any period in which the whole time of the officer receiving them was not given to the public service.

Head 6.—In cases of infirmity, if the applicant is below the ordinary age for retirement, a medical certificate is to be furnished showing that he is disqualified by infirmity of mind or body for discharge in the duties of his situation, and that such infirmity is likely to be permanent.

In case of ten years' service or more, this certificate should be signed by two Officers, of whom at least one should, if possible, be a salaried Officer of the Government.

Head 7.—As to "broken" service, see Head 5.
If the applicant has had any "acting" service; the details must be fully given, with a statement whether or not, during the "acting" service, he was connected with the permanent Civil Service of the Colony.

Head 11.—If, in special circumstances, a professional civil Officer has been allowed to have "private practice" without forfeiting his claim to pension, the facts are to be fully stated.

Head 14.—If the applicant is liable to any deduction from his service under Clause 102 of the Colonial Regulations, the facts should be fully stated.

Head 19.—The length of service and other particulars of the computation are to be given. When an average of salary, &c., is taken, the mode of calculating it (whether by months, &c.) is to be explained.

N.B.—This Form of Particulars is not at present used in Ceylon and the Straits Settlements, for which Colonies special Forms have been approved.—(See Despatches to Governors of those Colonies, 19th December, 1879.)
