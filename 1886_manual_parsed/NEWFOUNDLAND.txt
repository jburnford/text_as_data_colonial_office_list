NEW SOUTH WALES.*

This Colony is situated on the eastern coast of the Australian continent. It is said to have been discovered by the Spaniards in 1609, and was visited by several of the early navigators, Captain Cook having explored its eastern coast in 1770. The first settlement was formed in 1788.

* Norfolk Island, formerly a receptacle for English convicts, and Pitcairn Island, famous on account of the story of the mutiny of the 'Bounty,' are under the superintendence of the Governor of New South Wales. The inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were removed to Norfolk Island in 1857, but some of them have since returned.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 35° 25' S. lat., and 151° 17' E. long. Population, according to census of 1881, 224,211; estimated population at end of 1884, 267,194.

The Colony contains 310,700 acres square miles (198,840,012 acres), of which 852,017 acres are under crop.

The population according to the census of 1881 was 751,468.

The estimated population on 31st December, 1884, was 921,268.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean is 43° 5', to Grafton, 69° 0'. On the coast it varies from 59° 7', at Eden, to 69° 0' at Grafton, Sydney being 61° 7', almost the same as Madrid (61° 4'). On the mountains snow lies in some places all the winter. On the high table land at Bathurst the mean temperature is 56° 8', and on the inland plains about 70° 0'.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases; at Deniliquin it is 13 inches; at Sydney, 49 inches; and the days on which rain falls, 141. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; only 25 per cent of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while in Sydney 60 per cent may be said to fall in torrents of from half an inch to 8 inches per day.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry, cold westerly; and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

In 1874, 55,156,924 lbs. of wool, value 5,010,125l., were exported. In 1875, 87,534,280 lbs., value 15,651,643l. In 1876, 100,736,830 lbs., value 5,565,73l. In 1877, 102,150,246 lbs., value 5,256,038l. In 1878, 111,833,017 lbs., value 5,723,316l. In 1879, 123,710,450 lbs., value 6,491,198l. In 1880, 154,871,832 lbs., value 8,040,625l. In 1881, 139,601,506 lbs., value 7,149,787l. In 1882, 146,221,182 lbs., value 7,433,091l. In 1883, 188,161,710 lbs., value 8,953,100l. In 1884, 173,986,303 lbs., value

The Colony also produces coal, silver, tin, iron, copper, gold, tobacco, sugar, and kerosene.

A map is published herewith showing the mineral districts of the colony.

The live stock on 31 March, 1883, was as follows:—330,603 horses—cattle, 1,333,329—sheep, 30,379,871—pigs, 211,656. Gold and coin produce of the Colony exported in 1880 was valued at 830,776l.; in 1881, 1,915,023l.; 1882, 1,697,791l.; 1883, 1,689,517l.; 1884, 934,406l.

The coal mines have steadily advanced since 1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is given as 433,889 tons, valued at 236,230l., while in 1881, 1,775,224 tons, valued at 603,248l., were raised from 40 mines; 1882, 2,109,282 tons, valued at 948,966, raised from 44 mines; 1883, 2,521,457 tons, valued at 1,201,942l., raised from 54 mines; 1884, 2,749,109 tons, valued at 1,303,077l., raised from 48 mines.
