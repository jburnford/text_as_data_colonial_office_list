FIJI.

The Fiji Islands proper lie between 15° and 22° south latitude, and 175° east and 177° west longitude, and are consequently wholly within the tropics. They number about 255, varying in size from Viti Levu, with an area of about 4,250 square miles, and Vanua Levu, with an area of about 2,600 square miles, to the mere coral islet, crowned with a single clump of cocoa-nut trees. Only 80 of them are inhabited. The larger islands are mostly mountainous, rising abruptly from the shores to an altitude of from 2,000 to 6,000 feet, clothed to the summits with dense forests and rich grasses. The rivers are numerous, and subject to heavy and sudden mountain floods. Skirting the foot of the mountains and fringing the numerous bays which indent the coasts, are rich alluvial plains, stretching sometimes many miles into the interior.

The aboriginal population belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received some admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000 in number; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1874 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 the population has been reduced to about 110,000. The people were formerly cannibals, but have now been converted to Christianity by the Wesleyan missionaries.

By Letters Patent dated the 17th December, 1880, Rotumah, and all islets and rocks lying between the 12° and 15° of south latitude, and 175° and 177° of east longitude, have been included in the Fiji Government.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. This offer, upon the recommendation of Colonel, now Lieutenant-General, W. J. Smythe, R.A. (who had been sent out to investigate the case), was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. This government received the adherence of the Europeans, who persuaded the other chiefs to acquiesce in the supremacy thus claimed for Thakombau. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into attitudes of mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament, and in a manner at variance with the terms of the constitution. The question of annexing Fiji to Great Britain had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, both of local expediency and Imperial obligation; and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate the facts of the case on the spot, and report as to the best course to be adopted in the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable to Her Majesty's Government, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874; the form of government, the land question, and the various pecuniary questions then pending being virtually left to the discretion of Her Majesty. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government. A Legislative Council was established, to consist of not less than two persons, nominated by Royal instructions or warrant. There is also an Executive Council; and the usual powers of appointing and suspending officers, making land grants, and granting pardons, have been conferred on the Governor.

Sir A. H. Gordon arrived in the Island in June, 1875, but the Government continued to be administered by Mr. E. L. Layard, C.M.G., until the 1st September, when the Charter was proclaimed, and Sir A. H. Gordon assumed the Government.

By virtue of an Order in Council of the 13th
August, 1877, which came into force on the 4th February, 1878, Sir Arthur Gordon exercised the duties of Her Majesty's High Commissioner in over, and for the Western Pacific Ocean, with certain powers and jurisdiction therein expressed.

He was also appointed Her Majesty's Consul-General for the Western Pacific. The present Governor, Sir G. William Des Voeux, has acted in both these capacities since he succeeded Sir A. Gordon. An account of the Western Pacific High Commission is given in the Appendix.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and enteric diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable in Fiji. The islands are well adapted for the growth of sugar, the cultivation of which might place their prosperity on a secure footing. Their geographical position, their fine harbours, and the advantages which their occupation affords for preventing and punishing the outrages which have too frequently been practised against the Polynesian Islanders, render their inclusion within the British Dominions an important and fortunate event.

The highest shade temperature in 1884 was 87° in the months of February, March, and December, and the lowest 62° in August and September. The total rainfall during the year was 92·08 inches.

Shortly after the cession an epidemic of measles swept off not fewer than 40,000 of the natives. The alarm and distrust produced by this visitation contributed with various other causes to produce in the following year, an insurrection among the imperfectly subjugated mountain tribes of the interior of Viti Levu. This rising was, however, quickly suppressed, and the mountain districts thoroughly pacified, the inhabitants all adopting Christianity, and abandoning the use of arms. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the progress of the Colony has been satisfactory, every year showing a large increase in the revenue and in the amount and value of exports and imports. Considerable progress has been made in the settlement of titles to land, and sugar and coffee cultivation have been undertaken in several localities on a considerable scale. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their own system of village and district councils recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 550 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva exceeds 700.

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000l. to 18,000l. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce valued at the rate to be paid by the contractor for the year.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money.

The system, though open to some objections, may, on the whole, be considered to have been remarkably successful. As the people have little or no money, and live, for the most part, where they are unable to earn any without hiring themselves out for long periods, it is believed that in no other way could such a revenue have been obtained with so little pressure, while the system has this collateral advantage, that being worked almost entirely by the natives' own political and social organization, it tends to preserve the latter, and thus to save much expense in administration.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.
