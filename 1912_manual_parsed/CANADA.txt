DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba) were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabaska were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,650 square miles.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 87 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for Senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is now 221; 86 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 18 Nova Scotia, 13 New Brunswick, 10 Manitoba, 7 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 7 Alberta, 10 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $2,500 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $2,500 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot, and the franchise is regulated by the several Provincial Legislatures, which also regulate the polling divisions and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from November to May.

the Al by modified by Order in Council from December 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, which also regulate the polling stations and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from November to May.
For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials who possess the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. The territory not comprised within any province (such as the North-East Territory and the Arctic Islands) is very thinly inhabited, and is governed by a Commissioner and a Council of four appointed by the Governor in Council at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, as ascertained by the census of 1861, and in the case of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by each subsequent decennial census until the population of each of these two Provinces amounted to 400,000. Each Province also received an annual allowance for Government.

The Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, whose public debts were less, proportionally, at the Union than that of the old Province of Canada became entitled to receive an interest allowance, payable half-yearly, on the difference between their respective debts and certain stipulated amounts.

The annual subsidies granted to the several provinces have been revised by Imperial enactment (1907), and are now as follows:

(a) A fixed grant according to population:

| Population | Grant |
|------------|-------|
| Under 150,000 | $100,000 |
| 150,000 but does not exceed 200,000 | $150,000 |
| 200,000 | $400,000 |
| 400,000 | $800,000 |
| 800,000 | $1,500,000 |
| over 1,500,000 | $240,000 |

(b) A grant at the rate of 80 cents per head of the population of the province up to 2,500,000, and at the rate of 60 cents per head of so much of the population as exceeds that number.

(c) An additional grant of $100,000 yearly to the province of British Columbia for a period of ten years.

In lieu of public lands in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which the Dominion retains, each province receives until its population reaches 400,000, an annual sum of $375,000, payable half-yearly; thereafter until the population reaches 800,000, an annual sum of $562,500; thereafter until the population reaches 1,200,000, $750,000; thereafter the sum payable shall be $1,125,000.

Each of these two provinces, inasmuch as they were not in debt at the time (1905) of their statutory creation, are entitled to be paid half-yearly, in advance, an annual sum of $405,375.

As an additional allowance in lieu of public lands, each of these provinces became entitled to an annual allowance of $93,750 for five years to provide for the construction of necessary public buildings.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Provision was made by legislation of the Dominion, enacted in 1903, for the construction of a line of railway from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg, and thence to the Pacific Ocean, under the name of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The first contracts for building were let in August, 1906.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises:

(a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 square miles;
(b) villages with a population over 750;
(c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised within a large district, called a county, constitute

(d) the county municipality;
(e) cities are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 15,000. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councillors; the towns by a mayor and councillors, and the cities by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.
Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except a portion of Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,729,660 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion comprise a little over 1,000,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

Population, 1911, 7,150,000, approximate.

About 1,650,000 of the people are of French extraction, over one million three hundred thousand of these residing in Quebec, where French is the usual language spoken.

The total population includes about 94,000 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories, and there are about 34,000 half breeds. They are under the supervision of Government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs.

According to the census of 1910 there were 17,289 Chinese in Canada, most of whom are in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

The number of immigrants arrived during the year ended 31st March, 1911, was 311,084, nearly half of whom belonged to the farming or farm-labouring class; 123,013 were from the United Kingdom, and 121,451 from the United States.

The amount of customs duties paid in 1910 on British goods was $18,032,629.

### Industry

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. "Homesteads" of 160 acres can be obtained without any payment, and the process of settlement on the land in the west is rapidly going on; 45 per cent. of the population is engaged in agriculture, and 41,568 "homesteads" were granted in 1910, covering an area of 6,650,880 acres. In 1907 there were 3,516 butter and cheese factories and 7 factories producing condensed milk and cream. The value of land, buildings and plant is $8,564,440 and of working capital $1,641,787. The number of persons employed in factories during the year was 6,586, and the amount paid for salaries and wages was $1,811,875. The quantity of butter made in factories during the year was 45,930,294 lbs., with a value of $10,949,062; the quantity of cheese made was 204,788,583 lbs., with a value of $23,597,639; and the quantity of condensed milk and cream made was 12,176,135 lbs., with a value, including all products of condenseries, of $910,842. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Manufactures have been very considerably developed, the output being, in the year 1901, $106,08, and in 1905 $124,81 per head of the population. In 1911 the quantity of wood, blocks and other, for pulp...
exported was 936,791 cords, valued at $6,092,715; and the quantity and value of wood pulp exported was 6,588,655 cwts., valued at $5,715,532. The principal minerals produced in 1910 were coal $29,811,750; gold, $10,224,910; silver, $17,106,604; copper, $7,209,463; nickel, $11,181,310; asbestos, $2,458,929; lead, $1,237,032; cement $6,414,315; pig iron (made from Canadian ore), $1,651,321; and petroleum, $388,550. The total production of minerals was $105,040,958. Shipbuilding is an important industry, and, besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments.

The yield of Canadian fisheries was, in 1909, $29,629,170.

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is about 90,000.

The arrivals and clearances were, in the year 1910, a total tonnage of 44,567,991 engaged in outside trade, and 56,750,928 tons engaged in coasting trade, and 23,763,678 tons engaged on inland waters between Canada and the United States.

The number of steamers and sailing vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1910, was 7,904, with a net tonnage of 759,929. Of this number 3,332 were steamers, with a net tonnage of 357,493. The number of seamen employed was over 132,000.

In 1910 the number of light stations, lighthouses, lightboats and fog-alarm stations was 992, and lights shown, 1,227; the number of steam whistles, fog horns, bells and guns, 258; the number of gas buoys, whistling buoys and bell buoys, 369; the number of light keepers and engineers of fog-alarms, with masters of lighthouses, was 961.

Railways.

The length of steam railways in operation in the Dominion on 30th June, 1910, was 24,731 miles. This does not include 900 miles of the new Transcontinental Railway, which was open for traffic during the year, although officially returned as being still under construction. The estimated number of miles under construction on the 30th June, 1910, was 4,500 miles. The total capital invested amounted to $1,410,297,687 on 30th June, 1910. This does not include the capital expenditure on the Transcontinental and the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railways, which amounted to $87,250,549 in 1910. The total quantity of goods carried in the year 1910 amounted to 74,482,866 tons. The number of passengers was 35,894,575, and the distance travelled by trains was 85,409,241 miles. The total receipts were $173,956,217, and working expenses $120,405,440.

The Dominion Government owns and maintains 1,720 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $100,738,504. The working expenses in 1910 were $9,244,482, and the receipts, $9,833,578.

There are 50 Electric Railways in Canada with a mileage of 1,049. These ran 65,249,166 car miles, and carried 360,964,876 passengers, or nearly six passengers per mile run. The working expenses in 1910 were $10,121,781, and the receipts $17,076,124.

In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, via Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and a monthly mail service between Vancouver and Hong Kong, via Yokohama, which has been subsidised by the Imperial and Dominion Government to the extent of $219,000, has been established. Of this amount Canada pays $121,667. The Canadian Pacific Railway has now 12,806 miles of railway in operation; Grand Trunk Railway system, 5,480 miles. The number of miles operated by the Canadian Northern Railway during the year ended June 30th, 1910, was 4,480 miles.

Upon the western section of the new National Transcontinental railway the total mileage of track laid by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company to December 31st, 1910, was 1,469 made up as follows: main line; Winnipeg, Man., to Prairie Creek, Alta., 980 miles; main line, Prince Rupert to Copper River, B.C., 100 miles; Lake Superior Branch, Ont., 188 miles; Melville to Canora, Sask., 55 miles; Melville to Regina, Sask., 38 miles; Young towards Prince Albert, Sask., 25 miles; Tofield towards Calgary, Alta., 83 miles. The total number of miles in operation was 1,369, including the main line, Winnipeg, Man., to Edson, Alta., 922 miles; Lake Superior Branch, Ont., Fort William to Transcontinental Railway, 188 miles; Transcontinental Railway, Section F, Lake Superior Junction to Winnipeg, 250 miles. At the Prince Rupert terminus provision has been made for handling the traffic by the erection of wharves and warehouses, but work on the ultimate permanent lay-out has not yet been commenced. The eastern division of the National Transcontinental Railway, which is under construction by the Transcontinental Railway Commission, extends from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg, the through mileage from Moncton to the Union Station at Winnipeg being 1,805 miles. Of this division 68'56 per cent. was completed at March 31st, 1911. That portion of the line between Winnipeg and Lake Superior Junction (where the Grand Trunk Pacific Company's Fort William Branch joins the main line) was, with the exception of the entrance into Winnipeg, practically completed in 1910, and a fair share of that season's western crops was transported by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company over this portion of the line to Fort William. At the end of March, 1911, 1,388 miles were graded, 1,264'46 miles of track were laid (including sidings) and 784'73 miles of telegraph line were completed.

Great developments have also taken place on the Canadian Northern Railway, and during the year 1910 a new line of steamers between Canada and Great Britain was inaugurated by the Company. The new service, known as the "Royal Line," has Bristol for its English port, and the two first steamers of the Line, the "Royal Edward" and the "Royal George," are now making fortnightly sailings between Montreal and Bristol.

The long talked of project for the construction of a railway to the Hudson Bay, in order to provide an additional outlet for the shipment to Liverpool of Canadian grain, took definite shape during the year. Parliament decided that the line should be built and voted a sum of $500,000 for the commencement of operations. Contracts were signed for the construction of a bridge over the Saskatchewan River at the Pas.
Telegraphs.

There are 36,223 miles of telegraph line, and 145,997 miles of wire in operation in Canada (exclusive of miles of wire of Government lines), of which 7,788, including 294 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 7,329,251 messages were sent in 1910 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 3,413, being one to every 2,168 of the population. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. The telephone is very generally used. The Select Committee of the House of Commons, in April, 1905, reported that there were 81 telephone companies in Canada. Of these, 46 reported to the Statistical Office. Compilation of the reports showed that the 46 had 94,820 sets of instruments; 214,405 miles of wire, and nearly 291,000,000 connections.

There were, on March 31st, 1910, 398 electric light companies in Canada, having 20,701 arc lamps and 3,167,646 incandescent lights. Every Province of the Dominion is supplied with the electric light.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connection, magnificent inland communications. From Lake Superior to the sea there is water passage nowhere less than 14 feet deep. The total length of canals proper open is 2624 miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts for the year 1909 were $193,384, and the working expenses, including repairs, $935,378. Over one hundred and twelve-and-a-half million dollars have been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not yet been reimposed.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills, $1.80 being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

The Ottawa Branch of the Royal Mint was established in pursuance of The Ottawa Mint Act, 1901 (1 Edw. VII., c. 4), under which an annual sum not exceeding $75,000 is payable to the Imperial Treasury for the purpose of defraying the salaries of officials and other expenses of the Mint, the fees and all sums received being retained by Canada.

The Mint issues gold, silver and copper coins for circulation in Canada, and sovereigns and half-sovereigns coined are legal tender in every country under the British flag.

The Savings Banks, under the charge of the Government, on March 31st, 1910, had $38,264,229 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit on March 31st, 1910, $32,239,623, and on March 31st, 1911, $34,770,386. In addition all the 28 chartered banks have savings banks branches, but the returns to the Government do not specify the amounts on deposits in these branches.

III. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada was discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonisation were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter years nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), authorising the Crown to issue a proclamation dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-8. The risings in both Provinces were caused by Governor after Governor attempting to rule by the aid of Executive Councils not possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assemblies. The rebels were suppressed with very little difficulty. Afterwards the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. Subsequently, by 17 & 18 Vict. c. 118, the Canadian Legislature was empowered to alter the Constitution of the Legislative Council. This power was utilised in 1856 by an Act of Canada which made half of the Legislative Council elective for terms of eight years. This modification was an important one, for it was because of the dissatisfaction caused by the behaviour of the elected Councillors that, on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the new Senate was made appointive. The new House of Assembly, created in 1840, consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1854 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in Council, advised by five or more Cabinet Ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 106 members; Quebec, 74 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $6 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $1,000. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $6 per day while the session lasts, and their travelling expenses.

Industry.

The industrial wealth of Ontario is derived primarily, from its farms, its forests, mines and fisheries; secondarily, from its manufactures. In 1907, the value of the farm land, buildings, implements and live stock of the province was $1,222,000,000. There are over 24,000,000 acres of improved farm land, about half the acreage being under cultivation. The farms average 115 acres in extent, of which 81% are owned by the occupants. The average value of farm products per acre is greater than in any other province, and the total annual production is placed at $200,000,000. Dairying and the breeding and feeding of live
stock are combined with general farming. The value of the cheese factory output is about $18,500,000 annually. The total dairy output is valued at $35,000,000, the live stock output at $60,000,000.

All the fruits usually grown in the temperate zone may be produced in Ontario, not only successfully, but in a very high degree of excellence. Apples constitute the principal crop, but tender fruits such as peaches, pears, plums and grapes, are very extensively grown in the Niagara peninsula. The canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables is a well established industry. From 700,000 to 1,000,000 barrels of apples are exported annually, chiefly to Great Britain.

The value of the output of the mines and mineral industries of Ontario in 1909 was $32,772,684.

Great advances have in recent years been made in Northern Ontario. The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway has opened up a large and fertile territory. The mining at Cobalt has been notable; in 1909 it was producing over 25,000,000 ounces of silver, or about one-eighth of the world's supply, but the discovery caused so much unhealthy excitement that the great majority of the companies formed to take advantage of it lost their money.

Quebec enjoys a widely distributed, though little advertised, prosperity. Oats, hay, and potatoes are the chief crops. The best known mineral product is asbestos, of which recently the supply was about 90 per cent. of the world's. The industrial development has been rapid, especially in paper and tobacco products.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for both the elementary (public and separate) and high schools, of which there are 6,418, with 496,750 scholars in 1907. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and four theological colleges are also affiliated, and one university is confederated. There are also four denominational colleges with university powers in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges for boys and girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics' institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1908, 6,511 schools, with 360,512 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

Climate.

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°, at Montreal 42°; the extreme range being from 12° below zero to 91°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 26 inches; at Montreal 27 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between December and March is considerable.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the last census was 459,574.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonised by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I. in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the last census 40,832. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. A dry dock is also situated at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.

Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Digby, Kentville, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney (in Cape Breton), Amherst, Lunenburg, and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney, and this city is developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production of the principal minerals, that are
at present mined, for the year ended 30th September, 1910, is as follows:

- Gold ... ... ... 10,675 ozs.
- Iron ore ... ... ... 751,991 tons.
- Coal raised ... ... ... 5,477,146 ,
- Gypsum ... ... ... 322,974 ,
- Limestone ... ... ... 483,100 ,

There are large deposits of copper and other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe.

A large quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. The value of the catch of fish in 1909 was $8,081,111. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent. England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and the establishment of a plant for the construction of steel ships is proposed, and will probably be proceeded with in the near future; large bonuses are offered to encourage the establishment of such plant.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°.

**Constitution.**

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 18 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected every five years. The Members are paid $700 sessional indemnity.

**Education.**

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by a Board of Commissioners partly appointed by the Town Council and partly by the Government.

In 1910 there were 2,579 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 102,035 pupils. Education is compulsory in towns, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

Under "The Technical Education Act," of 1907, local technical schools have been established in all the larger industrial centres in order to produce a class of educated, skilled workmen for the various manufacturing industries. A central institution called the "Nova Scotia Technical College" has been established at Halifax, where instruction of a college grade is provided in mining, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The principal of this college is the Director of Technical Education.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.
New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,177 square miles, or about 17,393,410 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population on 1st July, 1901, was 331,120.

History.
New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.
The mean temperature of St. John is 41°, the extreme range being from 19° below zero to 85°. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches, and the snowfall 75 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.
Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, from which excellent salt is manufactured,
and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 65 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 7,117), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 40,711). Other towns are Moncton (9,026), Chatham (4,868), Woodstock (2,984), and St. Stephen (2,840).

**Constitution.**

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 13 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 46 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

**Education.**

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were 1,867 schools, with 67,785 scholars in attendance in 1909.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville and Memramcook.

MANITOBA.

Situation and Area.

Manitoba was created into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vict., c. 3, taking effect on 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-99° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°-53° N. lat., and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 73,956 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 62,260, which had grown to 154,442 in 1891, and 365,688 in 1906.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St. Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

History.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, incited by disaffected persons, rose in insurrection, and established a Provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection, having previously imprisoned 39 Canadians, shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871, the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid, but it was arrested by the United States Commander at Fort Pembina on the International Boundary.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence to two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced.

"Manitoba No. 1 Hard," because of its superior milling qualities is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle and dairy products.

In 1910 the production was as follows:

| Product | Area in Acres | Total Yield in Bushels | Total Value |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Wheat   | 3,014,400     | 41,159,000             | $32,927,000 |
| Oats    | 1,451,000     | 41,742,000             | 12,940,000  |
| Barley  | 684,000       | 13,826,000             | 5,392,000   |
| Flax    | 24,577        | 290,000                | 607,000     |
| Rye     | 3,800         | 92,400                 | 66,000      |
| Peas    | 1,200         | 18,600                 | 11,000      |
| Roots   | 2,714         | 800,000                | 352,000     |
| Potatoes| 19,798        | 2,838,000              | 1,533,000   |

Hay, etc. ... 117,500 135,000 1,378,000

The average yield of wheat per acre for ten years is 18.38 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Free grant lands are still available in several districts into which new railways are being projected. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased at from $8 to $20 per acre.

The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of about 10,000; in 1896, 35,000; and now it is over 135,000. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Carberry, Minnedosa, Morden, Manitou, Deloraine, Dauphin, Souris, Virden, and St. Boniface.

Coal of the lignite variety is to be found in the Souris Valley. Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful. A sand suitable for glass is found in great quantities, and the industry is being developed.

Manufacturing industries are becoming numerous in Winnipeg and other centres of the Province.

Railway Facilities.

In the year 1879 there was no railway at all in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains.
In the year 1907 there were in the province of Manitoba over 4,500 miles of railway, which afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.

Climate.

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°; but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 inches, and snowfall (November to March), 53 inches.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 4 members in the Dominion Senate and 10 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 41 members elected by manhood suffrage for 5 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876.

The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $1,000 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control was in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively. The local management was entrusted to school trustees elected by the people.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, all the previous School Acts were repealed, and a system of national non-sectarian schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns, and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school."

In 1908 there were 2,014 schools in operation, employing 2,526 teachers, of whom 598 were men, and 1,928 women.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled "The University of Manitoba," with examining and degree-conferring powers only. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian down to the 54th parallel, thence by summit of Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean—the average breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of coast line over 1,000 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 383,000 square miles, and the population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173, and at that of 1901, 190,000.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and seven in the House of Commons of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and legislative assembly of 42 members on the system of executive administration known as a "responsible government." The assembly is elected for four years, every male adult (British subjects) having resided six months in the province, duly registered, being entitled to vote.

Members receive $1,200 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

Population.

According to the census of 1911 the population is 362,768, including 25,000 native Indians, 17,000 Chinese, 16,000 Japanese, and 5,000 natives of India.

The chief cities are Victoria (the Capital) population 31,620; Vancouver, 100,333; New Westminster, 13,394; Nanaimo 8,305; Nelson, 4,472; Prince Rupert, 4,471.

Description.

British Columbia is the largest province in the dominion, its area being estimated at from 372,630 to 395,610 square miles. It is a great irregular quadrangle, about 700 miles from north to south, with an average width of about 400 miles, lying between latitudes 49 degrees and 60 degrees north. It is bounded on the south by the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the States of Washington, Idaho and Montana, on the west by the Pacific Ocean and Southern Alaska, on the north by Yukon and Mackenzie Territories, and on the east by the Province of Alberta.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream (Japan current) striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains; the climate is for the most part drier, and the snowfall consequently less.

Trade.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; in 1910-11 the imports amounted to $38,692,539, and the exports $23,016,655, showing an increase in the total trade of the Province in seven years of $33,000,000, a remarkable fact considering the number of the population. Exports consist of minerals (chiefly gold, silver, copper and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon, halibut, herrings, whale products and oil), lumber, furs, skins, etc.

Industries.

The mineral production of the Province to the end of 1909 amounts in value to over $374,000,000, towards which sum coal has contributed $114,000,000.

A great advance has been made in metalliferous mining; the oldest districts have increased their production, while new fields have been opened up. Total output of metalliferous mines for 1909, $24,443,025. There has been a corresponding increase in the population; some of these new mining districts, which a year or two ago were only inhabited by a few hardy prospectors, are now dotted with active and prosperous mining towns.

British Columbia has a vast and compact area of merchantable timber, producing an average of over twelve million dollars annually. The fisheries afford another great industry producing from eight to ten millions yearly. Only one-tenth of the available agricultural and fruit lands are at present taken up. There are immense tracts of pulp wood as yet unexploited, as well as extensive deposits of magnetite and hematite iron, and petroleum.
In 1910, 3,737 sea-going vessels (3,592,319 tons) inwards, and 4,137 (3,700,220 tons) outwards, entered and cleared, while 24,804 coastwise vessels (15,508,000 tons) entered and cleared outwards.

There are 1,800 miles of railway in operation, and 1,000 miles under construction, as the Grand Trunk Pacific and the Canadian Northern Pacific are extending their transcontinental trunk lines to the Pacific coast.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of the members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in city school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether first, second or third class) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 20 high schools in the Province, employing 59 teachers. The number of common schools in operation in 1909-1910 was 433, under 1,037 teachers, with an enrolment of 39,882 pupils.

The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma nor creed is permitted to be taught.

School districts are formed wherever there are 20 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.
This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long. Its area is 1,356,120 acres, or 2,133 square miles; it is about 130 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census was 103,258.

Description.
The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, etc. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,080) and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro' River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

Constitution.
Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $200 per annum.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

Education.
A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 479 schools, with 18,012 scholars. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic College not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens. A new consolidated school is opened at Hillsboro' through the beneficence of Sir William McDonald, of Montreal, a native of the island. Another is opened at Tryon by the people themselves.

Finance.
The province has a large sum to its credit, from which it draws interest. There is a provincial tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also a Road Tax in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND ALBERTA.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory, were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North-West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The Territories were governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1905, the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed out of the southern portion of the Territories, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs North and South. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,560 square miles.

Each of these provinces is governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, with the assistance of an Executive Council. Each is represented in the Senate of Canada by 4 members, which number may be increased to 6, and in the Dominion House of Commons there are 10 members for Saskatchewan and 7 for Alberta. There is also in each a local Legislative Assembly, each consisting of 41 members. Further information will be found under the heading of Constitution of the Dominion, above.

The seat of Government of the province of Saskatchewan is at Regina, and of Alberta at Edmonton.

The population of Saskatchewan and Alberta was (1901) 91,279 and 73,022 respectively, which numbers had increased by June, 1906, to 257,763 and 185,412. Since the latter date these figures have, owing to immigration, more particularly from the United States, been greatly augmented.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply also to Saskatchewan and Alberta. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Edmonton than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that there are 100,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement. Recent developments in Saskatchewan have been phenomenal; in 1909 the production of grain, roots, fodder and dairy products was of the value of $132,539,242, grown on less than 12 per cent. of the arable land of the Province; only two of the United States (Minnesota and North Dakota) produced larger totals.
The estimated revenue of Saskatchewan for the year ending 28th February, 1911, was $2,754,600, and the expenditure $2,742,456. The debt at the end of 1910 was $7,266,379.

In Alberta the crop area, which was 298,404 acres in 1904, was 1,808,719 in 1910.

NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES AND YUKON.

The North-West Territories now consist of the territories formerly known as Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, except such portions thereof as form the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and the Yukon Territory, together with all British Territories and possessions in North America and all islands adjacent thereto not included within any province, except the colony of Newfoundland and its dependencies. The Territories are governed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor-General, with a Council of not more than four members, also appointed by the Governor-General, and the Commissioner in Council is empowered to make ordinances for the Territories.

The boundaries of the Yukon Territory were more closely defined by a Proclamation of the 16th August, 1897, amended by C. 41 of 1 Ed. VII. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 61-62 Vict., cap. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate Territory, arrangements being made for its local administration by a Commissioner under instructions given by Order in Council or the Minister of the Interior. From 1896 to 1909 the Yukon produced $127,789,500 of minerals. The population is about 6,000.
