UGANDA.

(For Map see East Africa.)

Extent and Boundaries.

The British Protectorate over Buganda was proclaimed on June 19th, 1894, in succession to a brief administration by the Imperial British East Africa Company. The Protectorate was further extended over Bunyoro and Busoga on July 3rd, 1896. By numerous subsequent treaties concluded by various officers in the service of the Protectorate, the British administration has spread still further over countries adjoining the kingdom of Buganda proper, and the boundaries of the Protectorate may now be set forth more or less as follows:

On the east the Uganda Protectorate is bounded by British East Africa as far north as the 6th degree of north latitude, Lake Rudolph, River Turkwell, Mount Elgon and the Sio River running into the north-east corner of Lake Victoria; on the south, by the Anglo-German boundary and by the 1st degree of south latitude; on the west, by the frontier of the Belgian Congo, Lake Albert, and the Enclave; and on the north, by the 5° N. Lat. and the Uganda-Sudan-Abyssinian boundary.

The area of the Uganda Protectorate up to the parallel 5° N. latitude, but exclusive of the portion of Lake Victoria which lies within the Protectorate, is estimated at 117,681 square miles. Pending the complete survey of the country, it is not possible to give the correct area.

For administrative purposes the Protectorate is divided into five provinces (Rudolph, Eastern, Northern, Western, and Buganda), and then again into numerous districts. The King or "Kabaka" of Buganda is accorded the title of "His Highness," and his position and rights are regulated by treaty.

Climate.

The climate, when compared with that of some tropical countries, is not unpleasant but it can by no means be called healthy. European children thrive well in infancy in a few of the healthier stations, but considerable risk is attached to bringing them out when over two or three years old, as they are always liable to attacks of malaria and the consequent anaemia and general ill-health caused thereby. Residents in Entebbe keep in fairly good health but even there the three most troublesome diseases—malaria, spirillum fever and dengue fever—are by no means unknown.

The climate is mild, neither excessively hot nor cold, the average temperature for the year 1910 being—Maximum, 86°; minimum, 57°, and the average daily sunshine, 6 hrs. 38 mins.

The average rainfall for the Protectorate for the year ending 31st December, 1910, is 58 21 inches. Highest rainfall was registered in Ankole, Western Province, and was 92 09 inches in 110 days.

The seasons are not well defined, but there are two dry seasons within the year; one dry season usually includes June and July, and the other December, January and February.

The healthiest months of the year are usually January, February and March, July, August, September and October, and the least healthy, April, May, November and December, or the periods corresponding to one immediately following the rains, when the mosquitoes become more in evidence and malarial infections more numerous.

No part of the Uganda Protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Ankole in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria prevails at all seasons of the year.

Sleeping sickness has been the scourge of the country in the last few years, at least on the islands and along the shores of the great lakes and rivers; but now that the whole population has been removed from the neighbourhood of these, the disease is well under control, and should spread no further, in spite of the fact that no curative remedy is known and but little hope is entertained of one being found.

History.

During the first years of the British Protectorate an armed force was created from the
remains of the Sudanese army of Emin Pasha. To these other recruits were added from the districts of the White Nile, and the force thus organised, together with irregular bands of friendly Baganda, was used to repel the hostile attacks of the King of Bunyoro, and later of Mwanga, King of Buganda. Later on an Indian contingent, similar to that employed in East Africa and in British Central Africa, was established. Unfortunately discontent arose amongst a section of the Sudanese force. These Sudanese broke into open mutiny at the end of 1897, and Mwanga, who had escaped to German territory, returned to Buganda and joined the mutineers and Kabarega, rebel King of Bunyoro, in December, 1897. The Baganda, however, remained loyal, and after a year's fighting, with some loss in British officers, the mutiny was thoroughly quelled, and Mwanga and Kabarega were captured, and sent as prisoners to Kisimayu. In 1901 (Mwanga died May 8th, 1903) they were transferred to Seychelles, where they and a number of followers are maintained at the expense of the Uganda Government. Since the early part of 1899 the country has been perfectly peaceful, and has made considerable progress in commerce.

Communications.

The Uganda Protectorate itself is separated by about 800 miles from the east coast of Africa, but the north-easternmost extremity of Victoria Lake is not distant more than 580 miles. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the British East Africa Protectorate, transport was formerly exceedingly difficult, owing to the paucity of inhabitants to act as porters, and stretches of country unhealthy for beasts of burden. Consequently the Imperial Government resolved in 1895 to construct a railway from Mombasa to the north-east corner of Lake Victoria. This railway, at the end of 1901, had reached and descended the Kikuyu escarpment, traversed the Great Rift Valley, ascended the slopes of the Mau range to within a short distance from the summit, descended thence the Nyando Valley, and finally covered the whole 584 miles separating Mombasa from Port Florence on Victoria Nyanza, which is the terminus of the railway. Thus the line, though called the Uganda Railway, actually lies entirely in the East Africa Protectorate. The gross expenditure to 31st March, 1903, was £5,384,370. (about 9,500/- per mile). Uganda is now in telegraphic communication with Mombasa by a land line, and thence by cable with Great Britain and other countries. A telegraph line has been constructed to Butiaba on the Lake Albert, and to Masinde, in Unyoro, and to Nimule; eventually it will meet the Sudan wire at Gondokoro.

During 1911 a railway was completed from Jinja to Kakindu, a distance of over 54 miles.

Population.

The estimated population is:—

| Europeans, males | 484 |

| females          | 166 |
| Asiatics         | 2,216 |

Products.

Coffee of the Arabian varieties has been introduced and thrives exceedingly well. Rubber trees and vines are plentiful. A forest area of about 150 square miles has been leased to the Mabira Forest Company. Cocoa is promising, and fibre plants are abundant. The principal industry is cotton; the export has risen to over 2,988 tons in four years, and is all produced by the natives. Cattle are plentiful. Freehold or leasehold grants of land can be obtained from the government.
