NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.

(See Map under Rhodesia, South Africa.)

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shiré Highlands and Mlanje.

It is bounded on the north by German East Africa, on the west by the British South Africa Company's Territory known as "North Eastern Rhodesia," on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and has a total area of about 39,801 square miles, according to the most recent survey.

It is divided into fourteen districts, each in charge of a resident, who is also a district magistrate. An agent of the Government is stationed at Chinde at the mouth of the Zambesi, where a concession has been leased from the Portuguese Government as a landing and forwarding depot for goods intended for British Territory north of the Zambesi, and where a Postal Agency is also established.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 300 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

History.

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was
appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (now Sir H. H. Johnston, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.) arrived at Mozambique by H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaos round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shire districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wabenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (now Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shire and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanj and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaos at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. On the 22nd February, 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in October, 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

**Constitution.**

The administration of the Protectorate, which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Zanzibar.

This Court was transferred to East Africa in January, 1910. Place of sitting fixed for Mombasa.

**Climate and Products.**

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shire Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shire Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shire Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

**Industry.**

The chief products of the Protectorate are cotton, coffee, tobacco, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat.

Coffee, at one time the staple product, has declined; cotton has rapidly increased, the export in 1910–11 being 392 tons, 83 per cent. of the export trade is to the United Kingdom. Further development is greatly dependent on improved transport, as during the dry season the Shire River is shallow.

The chief imports are, provisions, cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition.

**Population (31st March, 1910).**

Europeans, 766; Asiatics (not including Sikh Troops), 481; Natives, 969,183.

**Means of Communication.**

A railway from Port Herald (the inland "port" of the Protectorate) to Blantyre (113 miles) is open for traffic. An extension to Zomba and Fort Johnston, on Lake Nyasa, and to the Zambesi, is contemplated. There are fifteen British steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shire between Chinde and the highest navigable point of the Shire, whence the journey to the Shire Highlands is continued by rail and road. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being 3,156. There are seven steamers on Lake Nyasa. Steamers arrive and depart every three weeks at Chinde (the port of entry at the mouth of the Zambesi) to Europe, via the Suez Canal, or by Durban and Cape Town. Mails to and from
England, are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

A message from Zomba to London takes about twenty-four hours in transmission. The total mileage through the Protectorate is 808 miles.

Education.

There are no Government schools, and native education is in the hands of the missionary societies. There are 1,237 schools, at which 95,137 natives receive instruction, which is largely practical. An annual grant of 1,000l. is made by Government.

Currency and Banking.

By a Proclamation in the Official Gazette of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling.

Banking operations in the Protectorate are governed by "The Banking Ordinance, 1902."

Two Banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., The Standard Bank of South Africa, and The African Lakes Corporation, Limited; the latter have also a branch at Chiromo and Zomba.

A Post Office Savings Bank has also been established in the Protectorate.
