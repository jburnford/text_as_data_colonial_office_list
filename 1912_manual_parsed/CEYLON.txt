CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane (Támraparnú, the Island of "dusky leaves"), is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustán, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 51' N. lat. and 79° 41' and 80° 54' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 266 miles; its greatest width 140½ miles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangamankande on the east. Its area is 25,332 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Máldives Archipelago, 400 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is roughly estimated at about 30,000; the people are traders and seamen. Male, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy: the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustán. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual mean rainfall is about 87-83 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November, but there is hardly a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.

History.

The authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity, exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

In 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

Constitution.

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government existing down to 1910 was established.

By Letters Patent and Instructions issued at the end of 1910, and by an Ordinance passed in the same year in Ceylon, the present constitution was settled.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of six members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Controller of Revenue, the Treasurer, and an additional officer nominated by the Governor; and a Legislative Council of 21 members, including the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, the Government Agents for the Western, Central, and Southern Provinces, the Principal Civil Medical Officer, one other office holder, and six nominated and four elected unofficial members. Of the elected members two represent the Europeans, one elected by the urban residents and one by residents in the country districts and small towns. One member is elected by the Burgher class, and one by the educated Ceylonese, other than Burghers or Europeans. Of the unofficial members nominated by the Governor, two represent the low-country Sinhalese, two the Tamils, one the Kandyans, and one the Mohammedan community.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

Population, Area, and Statistics.

According to the decennial census, taken on the 10th March, 1911, the population was 4,106,350, an increase of 14.7 per cent. on the population enumerated in 1901. The details of the population were as follows (including the military, shipping and estates).

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 1,106,321  |
| Central ditto             | 672,238    |
| Northern ditto            | 369,651    |
| Southern ditto            | 628,817    |
| Eastern ditto             | 183,698    |
| North-Western Province    | 434,116    |
| North-Central ditto       | 86,276     |
| Province of Uva           | 216,692    |
| Province of Sabaragamuwa  | 408,521    |

Total 4,106,350

Among these were 8,555 Europeans, 26,857 Burghers and Eurasians, 27,414,616 Sinhalese, 1,080,354 Tamils, 266,454 Moors, 13,089 Malays, and 12,198 persons of other nationalities. The Buddhists (2,479,118) numbered more than half the population, there were 932,696 Hindús, 408,984 Christians (mostly Roman Catholic), 283,782 Mohammedans, and 1,155 other religionists. The population of the principal towns was as follows:—Colombo, 211,284; Negombo, 13,045; Moratuwa,
The number of Indian coolies on the tea estates, &c., is about 500,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 530,279.

The entire area of the Colony is 25,332 square miles. About one quarter of this area, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. Some 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The most important products are:

| Product       | Acres |
|---------------|-------|
| Cocoanuts     | 942,621|
| Rice          | 680,574|
| Tea           | 589,845|
| Grain (other than Rice) | 101,708|
| Rubber        | 186,634|
| Cinnamon      | 47,292 |
| Cocoa         | 43,358 |
| Tobacco       | 16,241 |
| Coffee        | 1,512  |
| Cinchona      | 263    |

There are 609 plumbago mines and pits in the island, which gave an aggregate yield of roughly 632,275 cwt.s of mineral in 1910, the value of which may be estimated at over rs. 9,484,125. There are 1,986 gem quarries.

The pearl banks near Maanar have been leased to an English Company for a term of twenty years from January 1st, 1906, at a rental of rs. 310,000 per annum, it being stipulated that a sum of between rs. 50,000 and rs. 150,000, at the discretion of the Government, shall be expended annually by the Company upon the improvement of the banks on scientific lines.

The minimum upset price of Crown land is rs. 15 per acre. 46,042 acres were sold in 1910 at an average price of rs. 40 per acre.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs Duties, Land Sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt in 1910 was rs. 2,351,733. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Minuwangoda, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Nawalapitiya, Hatton Dickoya, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradapura, Badulla, Bandarawela, Ratnapura, Kegalla, and Moratuwa amounted in 1910 to rs. 5,972,154.

The municipal debt on 31st December, 1910, was rs. 8,025,659. Of this amount rs. 7,530,969 were borrowed from the Government for the Colombo Drainage Works, rs. 132,340 is the balance unpaid out of a loan of rs. 250,000 for the construction of waterworks at Kandy, and rs. 201,168 balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle for the construction of waterworks.

The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1886, 7,849,888 lbs.; 1888, 23,820,471 lbs.; 1890, 45,793,518 lbs.; 1892, 72,282,525 lbs.; 1893, 82,269,353 lbs.; 1894, 85,376,322 lbs.; 1895, 98,581,060 lbs.; 1896, 110,095,193 lbs.; 1897, 114,466,318 lbs.; 1898, 122,395,517 lbs.; 1899, 129,661,908 lbs.; 149,264,602 lbs. of tea were exported in 1900; 144,275,608 lbs. in 1901; 150,829,707 lbs. in 1902; 149,227,236 lbs. in 1903; 157,929,383 lbs. in 1904; 170,183,558 lbs. in 1905; 170,527,126 lbs. in 1906; 179,843,462 lbs. in 1907; 179,398,312 lbs. in 1908; 192,886,545 lbs. in 1909; and 182,070,094 in 1910.

There has been a remarkable development in rubber cultivation in recent years. Rubber was first brought to Ceylon in 1876, and its growth proved successful. On the failure of coffee planters preferred to substitute tea, which was found to thrive so well, and which gave a return three years after planting, whereas in the case of rubber six or seven years were required. On the price of tea falling, however, planters turned their attention to rubber, the demand for which had increased owing to trade requirements, and while in 1898 750 acres were estimated to be planted with rubber, in 1901 there were 2,500 acres, in 1904 11,000 acres, in 1905 40,000 acres, in 1906 100,000 acres, in 1907, 150,000 acres, in 1908, roughly, 180,000 acres, and in 1910 186,634 acres under this product.

The value of the products of the coconut palm exported in 1910 was rs. 38,313,348; of cinnamon exported, rs. 2,724,506; and of cocoa exported, rs. 2,861,760. Of the total Ceylon produce exported that portion going to the United Kingdom was valued at rs. 80,063,196, that to British possessions valued at rs. 25,667,370, and that to foreign countries at rs. 67,987,156.

The chief imports are rice from India, valued at rs. 47,064,866 in 1910, and textiles and coal from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of minor criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the Police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases. In addition to these there are the Ganabawas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 24 of 1889, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked well and are thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people. Besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, they have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided
school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1910 was 96,600, in schools aided by Government 203,020, and in unaided schools 36,764.

The total expenditure on account of the Educational Department was rs. 2,215,261. In 1888, the number of scholars was only 6,897, and the expenditure rs. 161,660. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education; small fees are charged for English teaching.

The only High School entirely supported by Government is the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-aid High Schools. Two Government scholarships, each of £250 per annum for three years (extended in certain special cases to four years), to be spent at English universities, are awarded annually.

Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are 34. A central Technical College was founded in Colombo in 1893; its title has since been changed to "Government Technical Schools."

A Government Training College for Masters in English Schools and Government Anglo-Vernacular and Vernacular Schools was opened in 1903.

Medical Institutions.

There is a Medical College, with a full staff of professors. The lectures are recognised by the examining bodies in Great Britain. There are two departments in the College, the Medical and the Apothecary. The former consists of students whose course of study extends over five years. A license to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery is granted to each member of the Medical department who passes the prescribed examinations in the College. This license is recognised by the General Medical Council of Great Britain as a registrable qualification. The members of the Apothecary department, after a training of two years, and after passing the prescribed examination, are qualified to serve as apothecaries. Female students were admitted from 1st May, 1892. There were 181 students attending during the year 1909, of whom 147 belonged to the Medical and 34 to the Apothecary department.

The Government maintains 71 hospitals, exclusive of 22 infectious hospitals, 18 jail hospitals, and two asylums, one for lunatics of 402 beds, and the other for lepers of 382 beds. There are special institutions for diseases of women, and for the eye, ear and throat. There is a Bacteriological Institute. There are 400 dispensaries, 73 of which are attached to hospitals, the remaining 327 are institutions independent of hospitals. In addition there are 220 private estate dispensaries which receive free drugs from the Government.

The Ceylon Civil Medical Department consists of one Principal Civil Medical Officer and Inspector-General of Hospitals who is also Principal of the Medical College, one Assistant Principal Civil Medical Officer and Inspector-General of Hospitals, one Accountant, one Registrar of College, one Director De Soyza Bacteriological Institute, one Medical Superintendent, General Hospital, Colombo, one Medical Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, one Medical Superintendent, Leper Asylum, one Superintendent, Civil Medical Stores, one Assistant Bacteriologist, Nine Provincial Surgeons, one Government Analyst, one Professor of Chemistry and one Professor of Physics, 65 officers having British qualifications, 2 with a Calcutta degree, 3 with Madras degrees, 3 medical women with British qualifications, 62 with licenses to practise granted by the Ceylon Medical College, 243 apothecaries, 1 Chief Inspector of Vaccination, 8 inspectors of vaccination, and 130 vaccinators, including 5 females. There are two institutions where nurses are trained, and the nursing staff consists of 16 European qualified matrons and sisters, 37 European Roman Catholic sisters (untrained), 32 matrons and 26 nurses trained locally, and 33 pupils in training.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1910 to rs. 3,903,000. The expenditure on account of estate medical aid was rs. 716,530 94. The receipts, which included cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, etc., amounted to rs. 301,038 01. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estates Branch of the Department yielded rs. 180,594 40.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is Indian and Ceylon rupee currency and sovereigns, gold having been made a legal tender at the fixed rate of rs. 15 per sovereign in 1901. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and piee. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue of which the amount in circulation on the 31st October, 1911, was rs. 23,427,240 00. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885. The deposits in these two banks amounted, on December 31st, 1910, to rs. 7,730,814.

Public Works.

The Colombo Harbour.

The Harbour Works consist of three breakwaters. The South-West, commenced in 1873, and completed in 1885, at a cost of 705,207L, is 4,212 feet long, and runs from the shore in a direction North by East. It is built of concrete blocks weighing from 18 to 30 tons, set in what is known as the sloping bond system.
The North-East and North-West breakwaters were commenced in 1894, and completed in 1906, at a total cost of £500,000. The North-East breakwater is a rubble embankment 1,100 feet long, tipped from a staging.

The North-West breakwater is an island work, 2,657 feet in length, running between the two shore breakwaters, leaving a southern entrance of 800 feet, and a northern entrance of 700 feet. This breakwater is of similar construction to the South-West arm.

These three breakwaters enclose an area of 640 acres, or one square mile, with a depth of from 30 to 36 feet at low water.

The Graving Dock. In addition to the above-named works a Graving Dock was commenced in 1899, and is now in use. It is 700 feet long, 85 feet wide at the entrance, and has a depth over the sill of 30 feet at low water. Its cost was about £400,000. There is also a guide pier, 800 feet long, to assist vessels entering the dock.

The Patent Slip was commenced in 1899, and opened on the 1st January, 1903, the cost being £43,000. It is 800 feet long, the cradle being 220 feet, and is capable of dealing with vessels up to 1,200 tons dead weight.

The Cooling Depot consists of 24 acres of land, reclaimed from the sea, with a frontage of 2,200 feet, from which 18 jetties project into the harbour for the landing, stacking and shipping of coal.

The total cost of the Reclamation and Jetties amounts to about £163,000.

The Fishery Harbour has been constructed to the northward of Colombo harbour for the use of the fishermen as a beaching ground, the whole of the foreshore inside Colombo harbour having been covered up by reclamation work. The fishery harbour consists of a rubble breakwater running out from the shore in a curve for 800 feet, the sheltered part forming a natural beaching ground for fishing canoes. The cost was approximately £12,000.

The total expenditure on the harbour from 1873 to the 30th June, 1911, amounted to £42,730,796 or £2,848,739., taking the value of the rupee at 1s. 4d.

An extension of the S.W. breakwater, starting from a point 3,150 feet from the shore end, is now in hand. The new arm will have a length of 1,800 feet and runs in a direction almost due north, protecting the present main entrance from the S.W. Monsoon seas. The cost of this additional arm will be £440,000, and it will be completed about 1912.

Water Supply. Works have been constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo. The water is stored in a reservoir at Labugama, 25 miles distant from Colombo, and conveyed by piping to the service reservoirs at Maligakanda and Elie House, whence it is distributed through the town. The total cost of the scheme was £4,330,000 exclusive of the cost of Elie House reservoir. A duplication of the main and reservoir at Elie House have been completed at a cost of about £1,863,200.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—1,704 miles of line, comprising 3,651 miles of wire are open in Ceylon.

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus:—Broad Gauge (5ft. 6in.), Colombo to Bandarawela (160½ miles), Polgahawela to Kankesanturai (211½ miles), Peradeniya Junction to Kandy and Matale (21 miles), Ragama Junction to Malara Quarry (1½ miles), Colombo to Matara (98½ miles), Ragama to Negombo (1¼ miles), Fort Junction to Wharf (1¼ miles), Narrow Gauge (2ft. 6in.), Colombo to Yatiantota (47½ miles) Nanuoya to Ragalla (19¾ miles). Total mileage 576½ miles. The total cost of construction up to 31st December, 1909, charged in account was £91,184,208. The receipts during 1910 were £20,160,124, and expenditure £8,838,955.

Steps are now being taken to connect the Ceylon railway system with that of India by the construction of a broad gauge line from Madawachi, a station on the Northern Railway about 142 miles from Colombo, to Talai Mannar, at the North-western end of Mannar Island. Steamers, provided by the South Indian Railway Company, will convey passengers and goods to the terminus of the Indian line at Danishkodi. The line, which will be about 63½ miles in length, will probably be completed in 1912.

Of metalled and track metalled roads there are 2,890·86 miles; gravelled and natural roads, 574·63 and 338·27 miles respectively; of canals 153·02 miles. The maintenance of 3,803·76 miles of road cost, in 1910, £2,424,587, or an average rate of £637 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees collect the commutation, but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new waterworks.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom and Ceylon, Straits, and China, and Australia.
2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles and Ceylon, Straits and China, and a monthly service between Ceylon and Australia by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes.
3. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, Ceylon, by steamers of the Orient Line.
4. By the steamers of the Norddeutscher Lloyd Steam Navigation Company, a fortnightly service between Europe and China and Ceylon, and a monthly service between Ceylon and Australia. The passage to Brindisi or Marseilles generally occupies from 14 to 16 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 5, 4, 5, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, and a daily service between Ceylon and India carried on by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company.
Letters, etc., from England reach Colombo in about 16 days (14½ minimum, 17½ maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, the N.Y.K. Line, Natal Direct Line, and the Indian and African Line.
