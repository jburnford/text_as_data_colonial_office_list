STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, comprising Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement, which now comprises also Labuan, Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 288 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindinga, area about 265 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed, by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There are large cocoanut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers about 700.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 43 miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 12 miles, and its greatest breadth about 9 miles. The inhabitants, who number about 1,100, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employés of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued to the existing Governor of the Straits Settlements in 1906, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17th March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. At first unimportant, that trade has now assumed enormous proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas of the Malay Peninsula.
Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 238 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, cocoa-nuts, and rubber. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Semibilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded in 1160 A.D. by immigrants from Sumatra. It rapidly rose into prominence, and in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries appears to have been one of the wealthiest and most important cities in the East. Its greatness came to a sudden end in 1377, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca, under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

**Constitution, Law, and Justice.**

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 10 official members and 8 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

**Climate.**

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1910 was 82°1°F.; in Penang, 81°9°F.; in Province Wellesley, 82°9°F.; and in Malacca, 81°8°F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 96°5°F. and 63°6°F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1901 to 1910, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 178 wet days; the average rainfall for the same period being 98°01 inches. In 1910 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 128°93 inches; in Penang 108°46 inches; in Province Wellesley 103°38 inches; in Malacca 76°64 inches; and in the Dindings 79°39 inches.

The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have southeast, south or south-west winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.

**Population.**

At the census taken in April, 1901 and 1911, the population of the Settlements was ascertained to be as follows:

|                | 1901   | 1911   |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Singapore      | 228,555| 311,985|
| Penang, Province Wellesley, and Dindings | 258,207| 278,003|
| Malacca        | 95,487 | 124,081|
| **Total**      | **572,249** | **714,069** |

The total at the census of 1866 was 273,000.

Trade.

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of ½ anna per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmeg, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, para rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, etc. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are tapioca, rice and rubber (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). The approximate quantities of some of the exports in 1910 were coffee, 2,051 tons; gambier, 28,948 tons; principal gums, *50,526 tons; principal spices, 91,026 tons; tapioca, 40,783 tons; tin, 57,405 tons; copra, 104,839 tons; rattans, 26,317 tons; preserved pineapples, 488,292 cases; and sago, 64,038 tons.

The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The quantities imported in 1910 were cotton piece goods, 4,491,966 pieces; coal, 758,615 tons; rice 592,161 tons; opium, 11,386 chests; silk piece goods, 365,641 pieces; petroleum (cases of 65 lbs.), 1,270,429 cases; sarongs (corges of 20 pieces), 369,913 corges; fish (dry and salted), 61,459 tons; tobacco, 7,009 tons; tin ore, 58,764 tons; and wheat flour.

* Para Rubber, 8,100,400 lbs., included in gums.
27,904 tons. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and the Native States. Singapore and George Town (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had, on the 31st December, 1910, 602 vessels registered, of a total net tonnage of 76,043 tons.

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe via Ceylon, and with China and Japan weekly by the P. and O., Messageries Maritimes; in addition there is a fortnightly service via India, and fortnightly by packets of the Norddeutscher-Lloyd and Hamburg-American Line, and the Steamship Company “Nederland” Line; and at frequent intervals by Holt’s, Austro-Hungary Lloyd’s, British India, Chargeurs Réunis, Glen, Shire, Japanese, and other lines; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manila via Hong Kong and by Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok weekly by Norddeutscher-Lloyd and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Messageries Maritimes and Netherlands India Company’s steamers; with Australian ports weekly, and otherwise by P. and O., Norddeutscher-Lloyd and Messageries Maritimes, via Ceylon, by British India, Burns Philp, Ocean Steamship Company, Western Australia Steam Navigation Company, and other lines; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, fortnightly by the British India Company’s steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, British India, Apcar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and other ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, etc., by local lines; and the Norddeutscher-Lloyd has a large fleet of steamers running between Singapore and most of the neighbouring foreign ports. Most of the larger steamers call at Penang. Letters from England reach Singapore in from 20 to 24 days.

Postage and Communications.

| Letters, Newspapers, cents. per 2 oz. cents. |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Within the Colony, and to the Federated Malay States, Johore, North Borneo, Sarawak, Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, Perlis and Brunei, per 2 oz. | 3 1 |
| To U.K., Egypt, India, and British Colonies, per oz. | 4 1 |
| Elsewhere, for the first oz. | 8 |
| For every succeeding oz. | 5 |

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1910 to $2,471,629, the principal business done being with the United Kingdom, India, and the Federated Malay States.

There is telegraphic communication by 5 submarine cables from Penang to Madras (2), Deli, Malacca and Singapore, and Singapore (2); and from Singapore there are 4 cables (1st) to Saigon, Haiphong and Hong Kong, (2nd) to Labuan and Hong Kong, (3rd) Batavia and Cocos, (4) Banjoewangie and Port Darwin. There is also a Government telegraph line from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Sungei-Ujong, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur was opened for traffic in June, 1909. There are 385 miles of telegraph line, 25 miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley, and 6,479 miles of telephone line. There is a telephone exchange worked by the Oriental Telephone Company in Singapore, and two worked by the Post Office, one in Penang and the other in Province Wellesley. A railway, 23 miles long, connects Prai in Province Wellesley with the Perak railway system. A railway, 15 miles long, from the docks of Singapore to Kranji, on the Straits of Johore, constructed by the Colonial Government, is now open for traffic. A railway connecting the town of Malacca with Pulau-Sebang, on the borders of Negri-Sembilan, forms part of the Federated Malay States Railway system. Reclamation and harbour works are in progress at Singapore.

Education.

The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which will be under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children in Malacca, Province Wellesley and Penang Island outside municipal limits. It is not compulsory in Singapore or Penang Town. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unitarian. There is a reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1910 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 8 | 2,818 | 2,625 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 29 | 9,381 | 8,907 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 179 | 12,009 | 10,251 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 2 | 88 | 61 |
| Total. | 218 | 24,296 | 21,544 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

* The extensive docks owned by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company were acquired by the Government in 1905, and are now controlled by a Board, composed of official and unofficial members. Graving and wet docks and other works are in progress.
A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Committee were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to 9½ and 8½ respectively. The half-dollar is now unlimited legal tender.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the International Banking Corporation, the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands Commercial Bank; the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank; National Bank of China, Ltd.; Kwong Yik Banking Company, Ltd.; and Sye Hai Thong Banking Insurance Company and Communication Bank.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes, but none have been issued since 1909. The average amount of notes of local banks in circulation in 1910 was $450,615 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the undermentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec. 1890—$3,920,000
" " " " " " 1900—$6,105,000
" " " " " " 1901—$9,178,000
" " " " " " 30th June, 1902—$12,393,900
" " " " " " 1905—$17,209,105
" " " " " " 31st July, 1908—$22,331,705
" " " " " " 31st August, 1909—$27,569,475
" " " " " " 1910—$33,446,860
" " " " " " 1911—$35,448,760

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1910, the deposits amounted to $674,002.

A scheme was in 1902 drawn up for placing the salaries of the higher officers in the service of the S.S. and Federated Malay States Governments on a sterling basis from 1st January, 1903. Existing higher officers had the option of accepting a salary in sterling (to be paid in dollars locally according to a monthly rate of exchange), or in the alternative, continue to draw their dollar salary together with exchange compensation, i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar = 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave pay and pension at home. In 1907 a local allowance of 10 per cent. was sanctioned temporarily to the same officers.

In 1911 a revised scheme of salaries was prepared, and duty allowances of varying amounts are now granted in lieu of the 10 per cent.

The native Weights are:—

| 1 kati | = 16 tahil | = 14 lb. |
| 100 kati | = 1 picul | = 133½ lbs. |
| 40 picul | = 1 koyan | = 5333½ lbs. |

Local Government.

There are Municipal Boards at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, the members of which are partly elected by the ratepayers and partly nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1910 was $3,692,947; and the expenditure $3,638,630.

Labuan.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30-23 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles; from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

An attempt was made by the East India Company's servants, who were expelled from Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish a trading station in Labuan, but the project was soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the history of the island begins with its cession to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei. It was then uninhabited. The reason for the cession, given in the treaty, by which the island was handed over to Great Britain, was that it was "desirable that British ships shall have some port where they may careen and refit, and deposit such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary for the carrying on of the trade with the dominions of Brunei," and the consideration given by Great Britain was an undertaking to suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was at first occupied only as a naval station under the control of a naval officer, and the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was deferred until 1848. From that date until the end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate Colony. Until 1869 it was assisted by grants-in-aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a head, and, as it was thought that the island could be more economically governed in connection with the territories of the British North Borneo Company, the administration was entrusted, from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the Company, whose principal representative in Borneo was given a commission as Governor of Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 1905, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1907, Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and declared part of the settlement of Singapore.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded great hopes for the success of the new settlement were based upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, but hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success. In 1883, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited. The mines have been closed since the beginning of 1911.

The coal from the Brooketon mine of the Rajah of Sarawak is exported from Labuan, and, in 1906, 11,881 tons were brought over for sale.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty, and vessels drawing 15 feet alongside the old jetties to coal.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton from standcocks close to the piers, and H.M. ships with coal, by agreement, at 15s. per ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, tortoise-shell, and beche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation. There are saw factories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into saw flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is no bank or savings bank. The currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary coins. Straits notes also circulate in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Brunei and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.
Two schools are aided by Government grants, but there are no Government schools, and education is not compulsory.

The small garrison of 150 or 200 men formerly maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn in 1871.

A railway has been made, 2 feet 5 inch gauge, and of about 10 miles in length, from Victoria Harbour to the coal mines at Coal Point. The railway is the property of the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited.

The Labuan Water Company was started in 1886, and, with two miles of piping, supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with potable water.

The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has connected Singapore, Borneo and Hong Kong by cable via Labuan. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

Steamers go about twice a month to Singapore, and also to North Borneo and Sulu. Most of the vessels calling at Labuan are engaged in the North Borneo trade, and ply regularly between the ports of that State, Singapore, and Manila, making Labuan a port of call, while several vessels call for bunker and cargo coal, on their way to and from northern ports of China, and the Philippines.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are cheaply supplied by a Navy contractor. Labuan has joined the Postal Union and the Imperial Penny Post.

The chief sources of revenue are the farming of licences to sell tobacco, spirits, opium (retail), and the rent of market stalls.

**BRUNEI.**

Brunei is a State lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta, of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the district of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 4,000 square miles, containing a population of about 22,000, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Tutong, Belait and Tamburong.

In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, and a further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. The Resident combines these duties with those of Resident of Labuan. An Assistant Resident is stationed in Brunei.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000. Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 300 in the capital. The principal imports are cloth and sundries, and the principal exports coal, cutch, rotans, sago and damar. The trade, to which an impetus has been given by the inauguration of a new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

A cutch factory has been established by a London syndicate at Brunei, and coal is worked by the Raja of Sarawak at Muara (Brooketon) at the mouth of the Brunei river, under the terms of a concession granted in 1882.

The Sultan and his leading ministers would derive a considerable income from the yearly cession payments made by the British North Borneo and Sarawak Governments had they not mortgaged them for years to come. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amounts recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from an opium and spirit farm and from the collection of customs duties.

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years previous to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889 by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1885 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Chief Secretary and to the High Commissioner for the Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States,* to control the Resident appointed to each State, and to be the main communication between the State Governors and the High Commissioner. Subject to the arrangement created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other mutual assistance in men and money, the wealthiest assisting those in want of help, and all most advanced being considered as loans; and undertook to raise and equip a force of troops for service throughout the States, supply a portion of these troops on requisition, the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should periodically meet in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Kangsar in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Perak expressed himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

No further meetings of this nature have been held since 1903, as the necessity for the principle of Federation, which was introduced in 1909. In that year a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The Council, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State, and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or more than one State." The Council consists of the High Commissioner, as President, the Secretary, the Sultans of Perak, Selangor, and Pahang, the Yam Tuan of Negri Sembilan, the four British residents and four un-named members, nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. Provision was made in the agreement for the addition, if desired, of the heads of one or more public departments and of a corresponding number of unofficial members. The Council meets at least once a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the Federated States. The first meeting of the Council opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

### Railways

The length of open line F.M.S. Railways is 537 miles, as follows:—Province Wellesley, Péraí, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, and Malacca, 23, 205½, 102, 154, 31 and 21 miles respectively.

* A not inconsiderable portion of Pahang trade is included in the Selangor returns only, at Port Swettenham.

† Square miles.
In addition to the above, 120½ miles of railway have been constructed in the State of Johore, and are worked by the Federated Malay States Railways. The main line connects Prai, on the mainland opposite Penang, with Johore Bharu, which is opposite to Singapore, and steam ferries at either end complete the connection between Penang and Singapore. Branch lines run to Port Weld, Teluk Anson, Tronoh Mines, Batu Caves, Port Swettenham, Port Dickson, Kuala Pilah, and Malacca. The length of line under construction is 42 miles in Pahang. The total length of line surveyed is 30 miles in Selangor, 53 miles in Pahang and 22 miles in Perak.

Perak.

H.H. Sir Idris Mersid-el-Aäzam Shah, G.C.M.G., Sultan.

Perak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State, which has an area of 7,900 square miles, is well watered. The Perak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus), the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills, on Gunong Kledang, and on Gunong Arang Para, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 70,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is 760 of metalled and 66 of unmetalled cart roads, 843 miles of bridle and other paths.

The whole length of the State is traversed by the main line of railway from Penang.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh (which has made extraordinary progress), Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909* the territory claimed by Perak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Perak, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory, which was taken over on the 16th July, 1909, and incorporated in the Upper Perak District, exceeds 1,000 square miles in area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legeh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasik on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

Selangor.

H.H. Sir Sulaiman bin Almerhum Raja Musa, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Selangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Perak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negeri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

The total area is estimated at 3,200 square miles, with a coast line extending for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Perak and Selangor, the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Perak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines.

The climate is uniform, and may be described as hot and moist. The nights are cool. The average maximum temperature in the low country is 91 and the average minimum temperature is 71. The rainfall varies considerably, as much as 124 inches having been registered. The wettest seasons are during March and April, and from October to December.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 46,718 (1911 Census). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is lighted by electricity. There are 59½ miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and a new post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence. The telegraph system extends all over the Sta...
and the telephone, with the exchange at Kuala Lumpur, is worked over about 400 miles of wire.

There are 56 schools in the State; 49 are maintained by Government for education in native languages, the remainder are grants-in-aid schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels registered during 1909 was 1,182,284.

The total revenue of the State during 1910 amounted to $9,238,345, and the expenditure to $7,831,805.

There is no public debt.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land. The only import duties are those charged on opium and spirituous liquors. In 1910 the gross total value of imports was $24,315,540, and the exports $46,732,136.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1909 was 266,006 piculs, valued at $18,088,479. The area alienated for mining is 76,110 acres, and there are 62,374 Chinese employed exclusively in this industry. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress some years ago, but has now been almost entirely abandoned owing to the fall in price. There are 26,316 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides. Most of the large estates have been converted into or sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1910 the area alienated for rubber cultivation was 225,013 acres, of which 113,114 acres were planted up. The value of rubber exported during 1910 was estimated at $26,260,569.

There are 72 miles of metalled town streets, 488 miles of metalled, and 54 miles of gravelled country roads, 181 miles of bridle roads and paths, and 52 miles of natural roads.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Tuniku Mohamed, C.M.G., Yang di Pertuan of Sri Menanti, and Chiefs.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan dates, as at present constituted, from 1895, but a similar Federation was already in existence before that year. The present Federation consists of the following States: Sungei Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungei Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at the Coast, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Kuala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and at Tampin.

The total area of the State is about 2,600 square miles. The population, which stood at 96,028 in 1901 and now stands at 130,201, is mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Tamils.

The value of imports amounted to $4,780,477 in 1909, and that of exports to $7,978,071. The revenue of the State, which in 1910 amounted to $2,066,573, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1909, 26,677 acres of land had been alienated for mining and 295,827 acres for agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative.

The Malay population, numbering some 65,000, is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coco-nuts.

During 1910 the areas under cultivation with these products were as follows:—Rubber 51,806 acres, rice 33,876 acres, and coco-nuts 19,246 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses about 59 Malay vernacular schools. There is an English school, together with a Convent School for girls, at Seremban, which receive grants from Government. Education is much appreciated by the Malays of the Negri Sembilan. A few Tamil vernacular schools also have been opened.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 663 miles, and consists of 400 miles of metalled and 19 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 247 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts. The Federated Malay States railway line passes through the State via Seremban and Tampin. Seremban is also connected by rail with the coast at Port Dickson.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Sir Ahmad Maitlam Shah bin Almerhum Ali, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, having an estimated area of some 14,300 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the
Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for house-boats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River, and 83 miles by road from Kuala Kubu, on the F.M.S. railway, in the State of Selangor.

The Sultan resides at Pekan, the old capital, near the mouth of the Pahang River, as also does the Regent, H.H. The Tungku Besar.

There is a daily motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 83 miles, and from Raub to Bentong, via Tras and Tramun, a distance of 30 miles. There is also a service between Bentong and Kuala Lumpur.

A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Raub, Kuala Lipis, and Bentong, and will shortly be extended to Kuantan on the east coast.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan (104 miles), and from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungai Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles.

An important road is now under construction, and will, when completed, connect Benta, a point 16 miles from Kuala Lipis, with Kuantan on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. The distance is about 150 miles in length, and it will render accessible large areas of land which are believed to be suitable for both mining and agriculture; but it will at present be difficult to persuade miners and planters to come to Pahang so long as they can find and in the other States, where means of communication are easier and transport expenses lighter.

A line of railway from Gemas in the Negri Sembilan to Kuala Semantan in Central Pahang, a distance of about 70 miles, was completed in June, 1911. It is now being extended to the borders of Kelantan.

The total revenue of the State during 1910 amounted to $1,017,801, and the expenditure to $1,755,128. Pahang has at present to look to Perak and Selangor for financial support.

In the absence of complete records, it is only possible to estimate the population approximately. The census of 1901 gave a total of 84,113, and the figure is now 117,933.

MALAY STATES NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEDERATION.

In addition to the territories comprised in the Federated Malay States, the British sphere in the Malay Peninsula includes the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu.

Johore had entered into a Treaty with Great Britain as early as 1855, and in 1885, the Sultan, by an agreement dated the 11th of December, placed his foreign relations under the control of the British Government. He also undertook to receive a British Agent at his Court when required to do so, but no such appointment was made until January, 1910, when, in consequence of a request received from the Sultan, Mr. D. G. Campbell, Resident of Negri Sembilan, was transferred to Johore to act as His Highness's Adviser.

The other States came under British protection in 1909 as a consequence of a Treaty, signed at Bangkok on March 10th of that year, by which Siam transferred to Great Britain all her rights over them. The transfer was formally effected in July, 1909, and British officers were then appointed to reside at the Courts of the native rulers, and to assist them in the administration of their territories.

The officer administering the Government of the Straits Settlements is His Majesty's High Commissioner for all Protected States in the Peninsula.

All these states, as well as the Federated Malay States and Brunei, are included in the Imperial Penny Postage system.

JOHORE.

Sultan, H. H. Ibrahim, K.C.M.G.
British Adviser, D. G. Campbell, C.M.G.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the north by Pahang, on the north-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the west by the Straits of Malacca, on the south by the Strait north of Singapore, and on the east by the China Sea.

The area of the State is estimated at about 9,000 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with virgin jungle, and has not yet been fully explored. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the north-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the north, which, during part of its course, forms the boundary with Pahang, and the Johore, which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bharu, the capital, situated on the Straits opposite to Singapore, and Bandar Maharani in Muar. The population of Johore Bharu is probably about 20,000. The population of the whole State is estimated at about a quarter of a million, four-fifths of the number being Chinese.

The principal products of Johore have hitherto been gambier, pepper, sago, and tapioca. In the last few years rubber has been extensively planted. Little attention has as yet been given to the mineral resources of the State, but tin is worked in one or two districts, and gold was at one time mined at Mount Ophir. Iron is found in abundance, but owing to the absence of coal no attempt has been made to work it.

The Johore State Railway, to which reference has been made above (see Federated Malay States), runs from Kuala Gemas on the Negri Sembilan border to Johore Bharu, a distance of 120½ miles. The line, which was opened for traffic in July, 1909, was constructed by the Railway Department of the Federated Malay States, the necessary funds being lent by the Federation.

KEDAH.

Situation and Area.

Kedah is a State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula situated between the parallels of 5° 5' and 6° 40' N. lat. and the meridians of 99° 40' and 100° 55' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (north and east) by the States of Singgora and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sanglang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.

Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah. Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded by Kedah to Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1800, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of $10,000 is, under the treaty of 1849, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the south. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the north of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern watershed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 105 miles in length and about 40 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi group, about 3,150 square miles. The two highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Jerai (3,986 feet) and Bukit Perak (2,820 feet). Gunong Raia, on Langkawi Island, is 2,950 feet high.

History.

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammadanism
in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like the other States in the Peninsula, it was, at various times, under the domination of Burmah, Acheen, Malacca and Siam. Like the other States, too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul, Perlis, and part of Singgora on the north, and Krian on the south, and under a weaker man, or upon the rising of a stronger raja beyond the borders, its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1641), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Oppenhoefden (Commandants) in Kedah from 1654 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpecting Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan, made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese, and held the country from April until October, but was later conquered by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammad Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1841 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of his own. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kedah.

General Description.

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammadans. There is also a considerable Siamese population. Only a few families of the aborigines (Sakais) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River.

The country is divided into South Kedah, the area lying south of the mountain known as Kedah Peak, and North Kedah. South Kedah is for the most part populated with Malays, who plant rice in the low-lying land along the coast, and Chinese, who plant tapioca, coconuts, and rubber in the land behind the coast strip. There is also a big Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be nearly worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally heavy fertile clay. A very large quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang, but no reliable figures have yet been obtained.

The population of Kedah is estimated at 220,000, of whom by far the greater number are Malays.

Galena has been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered.

Communications.

Steamers ply daily between Penang and Semiling, and Yen (in South Kedah), and Sala, and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawi Island.

A metalled road is being made to connect Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 45 miles. Of this, 10 miles have been finished, and two sections of 12 and 10 miles will be taken in hand early in 1910.

A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (25 miles), and an earth road connects the State with Singgora, with which the frontier is distant 30 miles from Alor Star.

There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in South Kedah with the towns.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There is an English school, and a Malay girls' school in Alor Star. There are twenty-four Malay schools.

Constitution.

Until recently the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1905, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

On the 23rd July, 1905, the Sultan, by an edict appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country.

The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H.H. Tunku Mahmud the present President. The Adviser and the Chief Judge are ex-officio members, and two members may be nominated.

All enactments passed by the State Council are submitted by the President to the Sultan for approval. Decisions in important matters are also submitted for confirmation.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1905 from Siam was of $2,400,000. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the trea...
of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government.

The estimated revenue for the year A.H. 1329 was $1,444,955 and the estimated expenditure (including revotes) is $1,613,820.

Perlis.

Perlis is a small State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula North of Kedah. Its area is about 240 square miles.

Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in bat guano. Perlis has a bi-weekly steamer communication with Penang, and has a good system of telegraphs and telephones. There are eight miles of metalled roads, and thirty miles of earth roads.

The population is supposed to be about 20,000. The revenue for the current year is estimated at $100,000, and the expenditure at $85,000. The State, by loans made in 1905 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are four other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

Kelantan.

Raja, H.H. Tuan Long Snik bin Almerhum Sultan Muhammed.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula. It is bounded on the north by the China Sea; on the east by Trengganu; on the south by Pahang; and on the west by Perak and the Siamese Monton of Petani, the boundary between Siamese and British territory being the Golok River. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,500 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan.
for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the State according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in July, 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the south. Gunong Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The Duff Development Company's steamers ply regularly between Kuala Lebir, and Kuala Kelantan, a distance of about 60 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semarak. By the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Tabal, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semarak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan probably possesses a larger Malay population than any other State. The total population at the 1911 Census was 286,752, including 108 Europeans, 268,707 Malays, 9,844 Chinese and 5,355 Siameses. Large numbers of Chinese, agricultural labourers are now being imported for the rubber estates.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 12,000 people. It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Raja's palace and the British Residency. It has a school attended by some 300 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese administration. It is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Chehe and Menara. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 4,000), Bachak (population 2,000), Tabal (population 2,000), all on the coast, and Pasir Puteh (population 2,000) the headquarters of the southern district of the State. Roads are now being built connecting Kota Bharu with Pasir Puteh, 30 miles, and with Batu Mengkebang, near Kuala Lebir, 45 miles. The route for the railway which will eventually connect Kelantan with Singapore and Bangkok is also being surveyed.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the annual harvest of which amounts to 70,000 tons. Kelantan is one of the few Malay States which export padi and rice. Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, para rubber has been largely planted in recent years. In addition to several small properties owned by Malays there are twenty large estates owned and managed by Europeans. As some of the estates have reached the tapping stage, there is now a steady output of rubber. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, and some 8,000 head of cattle are annually exported to the Singapore market. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of silk sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Dredging for gold is carried on successfully by the Duff Development Company in the interior. The Company's output during 1910 was 3,639 ounces, as compared with 8,508 ounces in 1909 and 8,867 ounces in 1908. Since the extension of British protection to Kelantan, there have been several applications for land for tin mining. The tin-mining industry is likely to increase in the near future.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, gold, cattle, padi and rice, betel nuts, fish, tin ore, and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, opium, sugar, timber, salt and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable and may be described as hot, moist and soft, but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plains the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90° F., or goes below 69° F. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoons keep the air pleasant. In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 103 inches a year.

TRENGGANU.

Sultan, H.H. Sir Zainal Abdin ibni Almerhum Ahmad, K.C.M.G.
British Agent, W. D. Scott, 660l. to 780l.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 4° 30' and 5° 45' North, and longitude 102° 15' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 6,000 square miles.

The total population of the State, as recorded by the census taken in March, 1911, is 154,073. This total is made up as follows:

- European and kindred races ... 10
- Malay races ... 149,379
- Chinese ... 4,169
- Indians ... 61
- Other nationalities ... 464

There are no roads, railways, or telegraphs; communication with the interior is entirely by means of the rivers and good native paths.

The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 13,991.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman, Kretai, Dungun, Paka, Merchang, Marang, Ibar, Stiu, and Besut.

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the north-east monsoon, from November to February.

The total rainfall recorded in 1910 was 101.48 inches. The temperature ranges between 70° and 94° F., the greatest range in 24 hours being 21°. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee and pepper.

During part of the north-east monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable. British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909; on this date a Commissioner from the Siamese Government surrendered in the presence of the Sultan and his principal Chiefs, the suzerainty formerly exercised over the State by Siam, to a British Officer (Mr. W. L. Conlay), appointed to accompany the former to Trengganu for the purpose of notifying the transfer, and of assuming the position of British Agent resident in the State. The suzerainty of Siam was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the Bunga Mas to Bangkok. This tribute will not be rendered in future either to Siam or to Great Britain.

An Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainal Abidin was signed in Singapore on the 22nd April, 1910.

This agreement of four articles provides that mutual help shall be rendered by the two Governments, and for the rendition of fugitive criminals. It also provides for the appointment of a British Officer to reside in Trengganu to be an Agent with functions similar to those of a Consular Officer. His Majesty's Government undertake to protect the Government and the State of Trengganu and all its Dependencies from attack by foreign enemies, and the Trengganu Government surrenders the management of all political matters with Foreign Governments to His Britannic Majesty's Government. The limitation of mining and agricultural concessions to any person other than natives and subjects of Trengganu is also provided for.

In the year 1819 Sultan Ahmad the First applied to Sir Stamford Raffles for a supply of arms, and under date of the 6th February in that year Sir Stamford Raffles wrote a letter to Major William Farquhar, in which the following paragraph appears:

"With regard, however, to those States which have not yet fallen under their authority (the Dutch), it is justifiable and necessary that you exert your influence to preserve their existing state of independence. If this independence can be maintained without the presence of an English authority it would be preferable, as we are not desirous of extending our stations; but as from the usual march of the Dutch policy, the occupation of Tringano, and the extension of their views to Siam, may be reasonably apprehended, a very limited establishment in that quarter may become ultimately necessary. It is at all events of importance to cultivate the friendship of these powers, and to establish a friendly intercourse with them; and as the recent application from the Sultan of Tringano for a small supply of arms affords us a favourable opportunity of advancing towards this object, you will avail yourself of the first opportunity to comply with his request."

In November, 1861, Colonel Macpherson, Resident Councillor, left Singapore for Trengganu in H.M.S. "Scout," a 21 gun corvette of 1,462 tons, for the purpose of removing an ex-Sultan of Lingga who had gone to Trengganu and repeatedly instigated attacks upon the neighbouring State of Pahang, which was invaded by one Wan Ahmad (the present Sultan of Pahang), acting under his orders, with a force from Trengganu. The Rajah refused to give him up, and the "Scout" and "Coquette," a sloop of 677 tons which had also gone, opened fire on Bukit Petri, the hill above the Rajah's residence. A letter afterwards came from the Rajah professing great penitence for his
conduct, and saying that the ex-Sultan had disappeared from Trengganu, and it was not known where he had gone to. It was understood that he was afterwards taken to Bangkok by the Siamese. The ex-Sultan of Lingga referred to, was a brother-in-law of Sultan Ahmad the Second, of Trengganu. His name was Sultan Mahmud. He died in Pahang, and his grave is at Kampong Merhum, near Kuala Pahang.

The ruling line of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainal Abidin, a son of Sultan Abdul Majid, of Johore, who died in the year of the Hijera 1109, through nine intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

The State is included within the Imperial Penny Postage System, and the universal Postal Union, under the regulations approved by the Convention of Rome, on the 26th May, 1906.

**TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.**

**TRINIDAD.**

**Situation and Area.**

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 69 miles, and its average breadth 54 miles, and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony includes the island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1899. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of Oct., 1898, it was provided that, on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, the island of Tobago should be a ward of the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony, and that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled. A proclamation was issued bringing these provisions into force from the 1st January, 1899.

**History.**

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalised his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago, by the census of 1911, was 330,093. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Germans, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 86,373. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of five members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted in 1898, and now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, the Inspector-General of Constabulary, the Director of Public Works, the Surgeon-General, the Protector of Immigrants, the Receiver-General, and the Collector of Customs, and of such other persons (unofficial members) as the Governor may appoint. The unofficial members hold their seats for five years, and are at present eleven in number.

**General Description.**

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Government acquired in May, 1910, the floating graving dock and workshops formerly worked by the Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company under agreement with the Government, and the concern is now being carried on by the Government as a business administration. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 65 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the administration. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the
north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products; more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1910 were: Sugar, 924,953 cwts., cocoa, 516,695 cwts. and coconuts 18,872,962. Molasses, rum, bitters, copra fruit, timber, manjack and asphalt are also exported. In the near future it is expected that the mineral resources of the colony will become of considerable importance. Two local companies are working manjack mines at Viatabella and Marabella, near San Fernando. The Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company have drilled for oil extensively on their lands at Brighton and seven other Companies are prospecting on private lands in the Southern part of Trinidad. The General Petroleum Properties of Trinidad, Ltd., and the Trinidad Oilfields, Ltd., are working over extensive areas of Crown Lands under leases in the wards of Guayaguayare and Guapo respectively. The Trinidad Petroleum Options, Ltd., and the Trinidad Western Oilfields were at work under prospecting licenses on Crown lands in the wards of Cedros and Cropuche. In addition, 63 prospecting licenses to operate over an area of some 84,386 acres of Crown lands have been duly registered, of these some few covering 10,996 acres have been merged in exploration licenses. Exploration licenses covering an area of 64,463 acres are now in process of formal completion while others affecting further large areas are under consideration.

The total amount of Crown lands involved in connection with oil development work under oil concessions in the southern oil fields of the Colony amount to some 400 square miles. A beginning has at last been made in the direction of the establishment of a fruit trade, and in 1905-6, 4,259l. worth of fruit was exported to the United Kingdom as a commencement of the industry, and in 1910, it had increased to 19,952l. The prospects of the banana and rubber cultivations, which have been taken up in recent years, are very encouraging.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about 75,000l. sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the last 49 years, 1862 to 1910, was 65.41 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1910 was 78.2 Fahr., the maximum being 87.9 in September, and the minimum 67.7 in January and the rainfall 68.19 inches.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1911, 59,658), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st March, 1909, 69 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 4,000 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

The borough of Port of Spain was placed on the 1st January, 1899, under the management of four Commissioners, styled "The Port of Spain Town Commissioners," but under an Ordinance passed on the 8th April, 1907, a "Town Board" took over the duties of the Commissioners in addition to those of the water and sewerage authorities. This Board, with Mr. Adam Smith as Chief Commissioner, consists of 11 members nominated by the Governor.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1911 (census), 8,697), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1911 (census), 4,076). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain in 1910-11 was 95,809l., the expenditure 95,511l., and the debt boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was 235,328l. on the 31st March, 1911.

A pitch lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of 10,000l., and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease is for 21 years from 1st of January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of 4,000l. a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from pitch (the majority of which came from the Lake) in 1910 was 56,038l.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, which is estimated at about 1,120,000 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of March, 1910, was estimated to be approximately 584,797 acres. About 423,600 acres are under cultivation; 535,203 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

The Gulf steamers connect with the railway at San Fernando and proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain. Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the railway. Under a contract between the Government and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company a bi-weekly service is maintained between Trinidad and Tobago, with regular communication between Port of Spain and all the principal ports of each island.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles) on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Prince's Town in 1884, and further extensions to Sangre Grande (12 miles) and Tabaquite (15 miles) were opened to traffic on 29th August, 1897, and 13th August, 1898, respectively. On the 2nd March, 1908, the Legislative Council passed a resolution approving the extension of the railway system from San Fernando to Siparia, a
distance of 16½ miles, and from Tabaquite to Poole, a distance of 13 miles, which had been recommended by a Special Committee in 1906. The first extension, which will pass through cultivated lands throughout nearly its whole course, has been estimated at £195,672., and will serve a population of about 14,000 persons, with a cultivated area of over 14,100 acres. The second has been estimated at £124,366., and will serve a population of about 6,500 persons, with a cultivated area of about 10,500 acres, which is, however, rapidly extending. The loan to be raised is estimated at £75,000. The preliminary surveys have now been completed. A start was made on the Tabaquite Poole extension on the 30th September, 1911. There are also 8 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande. The total length of line open is about 81½ miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total receipts from the railways, tramways and telegraphs during 1910-11 were £108,578., and the expenditure was £64,283. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund. The interest on 31st March, 1911, amounted to £21,607.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and about 93 out-offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada and Saint Croix, and thence via Canada or the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 85 miles, constructed by the Government.

The wireless telegraph system, established in 1906 to bring Tobago into telegraphic communication with Trinidad, gave satisfactory results during the year 1909-10. The following number of messages passed:

| From Trinidad to Tobago | 319 | 114 | 84 | 517 |
| Tobago to Trinidad       | 368 | 136 | 7   | 511 |

Every opportunity to communicate with ships equipped with wireless apparatus was taken advantage of, and 151 such communications were received during the year at the Trinidad station, and 21 at the Tobago station. In addition 7 ships' messages were sent from Tobago and 84 from Trinidad.

Wireless communication has recently been established with British Guiana. The system is not yet open for general service. It is practically a duplicate of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company's cable and for the present is for use only, under a special license, in case of cable interruption.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 60 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides some few transient steamers:—Harrison Line, Leyland Line, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Navigazione Generale Italiana, Scrutton's Direct Line, Dutch Line, London Direct Line, Canadian, Pickford and Black's Canadian Line, Orinoco Line (Compania de Vapous del Orinoco), Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co., La Veloce, and the Royal Mail Line. The ocean steamers of the Royal Mail Company now make Port of Spain their headquarters and connect here with the inter-colonial steamers of the Company. It is worthy of note that the steamers of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique are, as a rule, of greater tonnage than the ocean boats of the Royal Mail, and find no difficulty in entering the port. A weekly service to New York is carried out by a local firm and the Dutch Line, and to Canada by Pickford and Black's Line, the latter service being subsidised. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers. The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

- Within Colony ... ... ... ld.
- To U.K., India and British Colonies* ld.
- To other places ... ... ... 2½d.

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £69,187.14s.11d. was expended by the Government in 1908-9, in introducing 2,445 (Statute adults) immigrants. The numbers introduced in 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901-2, 1902-3, 1903-4, 1904-5, 1905-6, 1906-7, 1907-8, 1908-9 and 1909-10, 1910-11 respectively were 3,087, 1,860, 1,282, 1,750, 1,779, 2,475, 2,948, 2,458, 1,219, 3,604, 2,417, 1,860, 2,445, 2,611 and 3,286.

622 Statute adults were returned to India on 14th December, 1910.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, and United States gold currency. These are all legal tender, but British gold is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of £100,000, estimated. The Royal Bank of Canada also issues its own notes.

There is no Colonial coinage, but an Ordinance (No. 16.-1903), for the issue of Government 1 and 2 dollar currency Notes was passed on the 23rd December, 1903, and these Government currency notes are now in common use.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank and the Union Bank of Halifax have now branches in Port of Spain and San Fernando. Government savings banks are established in thirteen districts, with a head office in Port of Spain. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1910 was £360,796.15s. 4½d. The total number of depositors was 19,652. They are under the management of a board, a chief manager of savings banks, and the local wardens.

Openings for the Investment of Capital.—Of the industries which offer inducements to investors of capital, in Trinidad and Tobago, the cultivation of cocoa is perhaps the most attractive, and profitable investments are to be secured either in

(a) the formation of an estate,
(b) the purchase of an established estate, or
(c) the investment of capital on the security of an established estate.

Sound investments for capital can usually be obtained for sums under £1,000 (20£. 6s. 8½d.) at 10½%; from £1,000 up to £6,000 (1,250£.) at 8%; and over £6,000 at 6 or 7%.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Roya...
College (secular), the Roman Catholic Institutions, St. Mary's College and the Convent School in Port of Spain, and Naparima College (Presbyterian)—the two latter being affiliated to the Royal College. Attached to these institutions are three exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of £150., each tenable for four years, or £200., tenable for three years, at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of March, 1910—231 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 237 on those of St. Mary's College, and 68 in the Naparima College.

The elementary schools are now 263 in number, 53 of which are secular schools, supported entirely by Government, and 210 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the practising schools and 2 assisted schools 5s. per month is charged. There are 2 Government and 3 denominational colleges for teachers, in which 42 students are trained. The Government schools in 1910-11 had 35,210 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 10,177.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 47,661, with an average daily attendance of 27,083. The teaching of practical agriculture now proves part of the daily routine in the majority of boys' and mixed schools throughout the Colony. 218 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1910-11.

**TOBAGO.**

**History.**

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanderers were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

By Order in Council under Act 50 & 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, Tobago became a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from the 1st January, 1899.

**Situation and Area.**

It lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,313 acres, of which about 10,000 acres are under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

**General Description.**

Sugar, rum, molasses, cocoanuts, and live stock form the principal articles of export. Cocoa and rubber are now, however, being fairly extensively planted. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the Windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 13,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The cultivation of cotton is now forming an important minor industry in Tobago, and a cotton gin, operated by a steam engine, has been erected by the Government in the chief town Scarborough.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1911, of 729. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacolet Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.
Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of subsidized coastal steamers, provided under contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created. Various other changes have been made in the direction of reducing the establishments.
