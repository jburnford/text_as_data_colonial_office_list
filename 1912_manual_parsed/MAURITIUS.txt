MAURITIUS.

Situation and Area.

Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 18' and 57° 49' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat., distant 115 miles from Réunion, 934 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 720 square miles (nearly equal to Surrey), having an extreme length of 36 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 28 miles from east to west.

The formation of the island is supposed to be volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude. The highest peak, the Piton de la Rivière-Noire, is 2,711 English feet, and Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable for any distance from the sea.

History.

The island was discovered in 1505 by the Portuguese navigator, Pedro Macarenhas, but the Portuguese merely used the island as a port of call and made no settlement there. The first settlers were the Dutch. In 1598 a Dutch fleet landed at the island, to which its commander, Admiral J. C. Van Neck, gave the name of Mauritius, in honour of the Stadtholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. For many years no attempt was made to colonise the island, but about 1640 settlements were established at various points, the seat of government being on the south-east of the island, at the place now known as Grand Port. The colony, however, did not prosper, and it was finally abandoned in 1712. In 1715 a party of Frenchmen landed in the island, and in 1721 it was formally taken possession of by the French, at first on behalf of the French East India Company, and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the Crown of France. The name of the island was changed by the French to that of Ile de France, which it retained till the landing of the English in 1810, when its former name of Mauritius was restored. The most celebrated of the French Governors was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735-1746), "a man of eminent talents and virtues" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane, and of many other valuable plants, and was the real founder of the prosperity of the island.

During the long war between England and France Mauritius was a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, owing to the facility with which sorties were made from it by French men-of-war and privateers, and in 1809 the British Government determined on its capture. An expeditionary force was sent from India, and, after several naval engagements, the island was finally surrendered to Great Britain on December 3rd, 1810, the laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The island was visited by a terrible hurricane on the 29th of April, 1892, which caused an enormous destruction of buildings and crops.

On the 23rd of July, 1893, a part of the town of Port Louis was entirely destroyed by fire.

On the 22nd February, 1894, during a small cyclone, a railway train was blown down in a ravine at Pailles Bridge; five persons were killed and great loss of material sustained.

An outbreak of Surra, in 1902, caused great loss of draught animals, and mechanical means of transport had to be resorted to for the sugar plantations. A number of locomotives and traction engines were introduced, and a loan was raised to enable the planters to lay down tramways, and take other steps to provide transport.

General Description.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French nobles. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture. The natives are proud of their country, and of the designation of Creoles.

Eleven daily newspapers and eight other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language is spoken all over the island, English being used in the courts of justice. Debates in the Council of Government may take place in either language.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of 50,060 souls (census 1911). The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive more than a hundred vessels. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The trade of the island passes almost entirely through Port Louis. The city has an elected municipal corporation, and raised in 1910 a revenue of Rs. 523,494, against an expenditure of Rs. 504,058. Its debts amount to Rs. 136,657, and Rs. 91,736.

The principal public edifices of Port Louis are the Government House, the Institute, the Roman Catholic and Protestant cathedrals, the Civil Hospital, the Town Hall, the theatre, the public offices, &c.

After Port Louis, the largest town is Curepipe, incorporated in 1890 (population 17,173, census of 1911), situated on the uplands in the Plaines Wilhems. Its climate is temperate.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg (population 4,068, census of 1911), so called in honour of Mahé de Labourdonnais.

Indian Population.

At the Census of 1911 the population of Mauritius (exclusive of the Dependencies, but including Military) was found to consist of:

| Persons of European, African, or mixed descent | 108,844 |
| Indo-Mauritians, i.e., persons of Indian descent, born in Mauritius | 22,361 |
| Other Indians | 35,526* |
| Chinese | 3,662 |

Total | 370,393

* There is reason to believe that a number of old Indian immigrants (i.e. those whose contract has expired) have returned themselves as Indo-Mauritians.
The total number of Indians was thus 257,887, or 69·6 per cent. of the total population.

The Indian population dates from the emancipation of the slaves in 1834-9. The freed slaves, who numbered about 66,000, were in many cases unwilling to work on their late masters' estates, and recourse was had by the estate owners to Indian immigration. This immigration of labourers from India started in 1834, and except for occasional temporary stoppages, continued until 1910, when it was discontinued. The descendants of these immigrants—the Indo-Mauritians—now form the largest section of the population; they are steadily increasing in numbers. They are predominant in the domestic, commercial, and still more in the agricultural callings, and the amount of land held by them as small planters is rapidly growing.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1884-85. It now consists of a Governor, with an Executive Council of four ex-officio members, and a Legislative Council of twenty-seven members, eight being ex-officio, nine nominated by the Governor, and ten elected—two for the town of Port Louis, and one for each of the eight rural districts. At least one-third of the nominated members must be persons not holding any public office. Members are not paid; they may speak either in French or English. The number of registered electors on 1st January, 1911, was 6,171; the franchise qualification is ownership of immovables of annual value of Rs. 300, or movables worth Rs. 3,000, or payment of rent of Rs. 25 monthly, or of license duty of Rs. 200 annually, or receipt of salary of Rs. 50 monthly. The session usually lasts from April to December.

The law is based on the Code Napoléon, and other French laws modified by Colonial Ordinances.

**Climate, &c.**

From December to April is the hottest season in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The temperature on the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The climate at Curepipe, from 1,700 to 1,900 feet above the sea, resembles that of the South of France or Italy. The hurricane season extends from December to the end* of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 30° S. latitude.

**Mean Annual Rainfall.**

At the Observatory (1890-1910) ... 48·42 ins.
Ditto ditto (1900-1910) ... 47·50 "
At Curepipe (1895-1910) ... 114·33 "

**Water Supply.**

A reservoir on the Grande Rivière for the supply of Port Louis Town was constructed some years ago by the Municipality. The works begun by the Government in 1885 for supplying pure water from the upland springs to the chief centres of population are complete. The mains extend from the Mare aux Vacoas—with branches—the whole covering a surface of 60 square miles. The reservoirs and canals so constructed can supply four millions of gallons per day. These waterworks cost Rs. 430,000. The fever has decreased in the localities now supplied with this upland water. The Mare aux Vacoas water main has now been extended to the District of Moka, as far as St. Pierre village, and the following establishments provided with a supply of the water: Government House, "Le Reduit," the "Station Agronomique," Reduit, the Bacteriological Laboratory, Reduit.

**Scenery.**

The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the 18th century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

**Railways.**

There are seven lines of railway, all owned and worked by Government, viz.: (1) The North line, from Port Louis to the sea coast village of Grand River South-east. Its length is 31 miles, and its course is approximately parallel to the northern coast line of the island. (2) The Montagne Longue branch from Terre Rouge station on the North Line to the village of Montagne Longue; its length is 3¾ miles. (3) The Midland line, beginning at Port Louis and running across the island to the sea coast town of Mahébourg on the other side; its length is 33·3 miles, with a summit level of 1,822 feet at Curepipe; the gradient in many places is 1 in 27. (4) The Moka-Flacq line from the Rose Hill station on the Midland line to Rivière Séche station on the North line; length 26·2 miles. (5) Savanne branch from Rosebelle station on the Midland line to the sea coast town of Souillac at the southern extremity of the island; its length is 10·90 miles. (6) Black River branch, from Richelieu on the Midland line to Tamarin, distance 12·75 miles. (7) Rivière du Poste to Mexico, length 10 miles. All the above are of standard gauge, 4' 8¼", except the 7th which is 75 centimetres (2' 6"). The total number of miles of railway now open is 119·65 of standard gauge and 10 of 2' 6" gauge, the total cost up to date being about 1,438,596L. The receipts in 1910 were Rs. 2,772,635 (including traffic done for other Government departments), and expenditure, Rs. 1,658,766, not including the charge on account of Railway Loans.

**Religion.**

The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the census of 1911, the Roman Catholics numbered 120,000, and the Protestants about 7,000. The Roman Catholics received in 1909-10 Government aid amounting to Rs. 111,520, and the Protestants Rs. 41,116.

**Education.**

The system of education was remodelled by Ordinance No. 33 of 1899 (brought into force on 21st August, 1900), and all former enactments on the subject were repealed.

Under the Education Ordinance, 1899, a Department of Public Instruction is created and placed under the charge of an officer styled "The Director of Public Instruction."
The department has two branches: (1) the Superior or Secondary Instruction, to which is attached the Government Royal College with its two schools, under the charge of the Rector of the Royal College, as well as the Associated Schools; and (2), the Primary Instruction, consisting of the Government Schools and the Grant-in-Aid Schools, under the more immediate control of the Director, assisted by Inspectors of Schools.

The Education Ordinance, 1899, also provides for the appointment of a Principal and Staff for any Government Institution to be established for Technical, Agricultural, Commercial, and General Education.

In the discharge of his duties the Director is assisted by two Advisory Committees of twelve members each, appointed annually. In respect of Superior and Secondary Education, by the Committee of "Superior Instruction," on which the Associated Schools and the Girls' Schools are represented by one nominee member each. In respect of Primary Education, by the Committee of "Primary Instruction," on which the Roman Catholic grant-in-aid Primary Schools are represented by two nominees and the Protestant grant-in-aid Primary Schools by one nominee. The Director of Public Instruction is the chairman of both Committees, and the Governor selects and appoints eight members to each Committee.

The Director is responsible for carrying out all regulations dealing with the education of youth in the colony, but the exercise of the powers conferred upon him by the Ordinance is subject to an appeal to the Governor in Executive Council.

**Higher Education.**

On the books of the Royal College on the 31st December, 1910, there were 390 pupils; of these 194 attended the Royal College, and 196 the two schools of the Royal College.

**Primary Education.**

There were in 1910—

| Number | Pupils |
|--------|--------|
| Government schools | 61 | 9,326 |
| Grant schools | 88 | 11,621 |
| **Total** | **149** | **20,947** |

**Total Number of Pupils.**

The relative numbers are shown by the following percentages:

- Church of England: 23%
- Roman Catholic: 61%
- Other Christian denominations: 10%
- Mohammedan: 11%
- Hindoos and others: 23%

The total expenditure on education in 1910 amounted to Rs. 609,567, of which Rs. 413,988 were expended on primary education. There are 146 masters, mistresses, and assistants employed in Government Schools and 347 in Grant Schools. Of the pupils in the aided schools 77% belong to the Church of England, 19% to other Christian denominations. No assistance is given to Hindu schools, but one assisted Mohammedan school was opened in Plaines Wilhems District during the year 1894.

**Communications.**

The mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes leave Marseilles on the 10th and 25th of each month, arriving in Mauritius on the 10th and 20th of the following month respectively. The steamers leave Mauritius on the 12th and 25th of each month, and arrive at Marseilles on the 14th and 25th of the following month respectively. There is a four-weekly service with England, via the Cape of Good Hope, by the steamers of the Union-Castle line. The British India Steam Navigation Company provides a direct four-weekly service between Colombo and Mauritius. There is frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, Réunion, &c.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication is established along and beyond the railway, the total length of line being 375 miles of telegraph and 87 of telephone; and cable communication through a branch office of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company with Europe, via Seychelles, Zanzibar, and Aden, was opened in November, 1893. The Company receives from the Colony an annual subsidy of 7,000L. Through rate: United Kingdom to Mauritius, 3s. per word; and from Mauritius to United Kingdom, Rs. 1.90. The laying of the Mauritius section of the Cape-Australian cable, via Rodrigues, was completed on May 16, 1902.

There are in Mauritius the General Post Office in the city of Port Louis, and 62 branch post offices in the rural districts, 62 money order offices, 57 telegraph and 31 telephone offices. Port Louis has a telephone system, with 79 subscribers. In the island of Rodrigues there is one post office at Port Mathurin. There is no post office on any other of the Dependencies. The rates of postage are:

| Letters Newspapers |
|-------------------|
| per 28 grs. | per 50 grs. |
| United Kingdom, and British Possessions, &c., which have adopted the Imperial Penny Postage | 6 cents | 3 cents |
| Dependencies of Mauritius | 4 | 1 cent |
| Other countries of the Postal Union or non-Union Countries | 15 cents | 3 cents |

**Parcels Post Rates.**—In addition to the following charges, the ruling rate of exchange on the day of posting of such parcels is also levied in regard to parcels via France.

| Via France. | Via Colombo. |
|-------------|-------------|
| Not over 1 kilo | Not over 3 lbs... |
| 361 grs. | 1 0 |
| Over 1·361 kilos and not over 3 kilos | Over 3 lbs. but not over 7 lbs. |
| 175 grs. | 2 0 |
| Over 3·175 kilos and not over 5 kilos | Over 7 lbs. but not over 11 lbs. |
| 4 0 |

**Commerce.**

The island produces hardly anything for its own consumption, but its foreign commerce extends to every quarter of the globe.

The chief exports are sugar, rum, molasses, spice, vanilla, aloe-fibre, oil, soap, &c. Oxen are imported from Madagascar, sheep from South Africa and Australia, frozen meat from Australia, and food-stuffs from India.
The imports consist mainly of grain (rice, wheat, &c.), cotton manufactures, wine, coals, hardware, and manure. There is a small tobacco plantation, but sugar production is the greatest industry. About 96 per cent. of the value of the exports is due to shipments of sugar. In 1910 the weight of sugar exported was 215,743,242 kilos., with an estimated value of Rs. 34,734,663. The value of the rum exported was Rs. 29,761; that of vanilla, Rs. 17,412; that of aloe-fibre, Rs. 627,501; that of cocoa-nut oil, Rs. 141,968; and that of molasses, Rs. 510,727.

The number of vessels registered at Port Louis is now 59, of a total tonnage of 4,919.

Currency and Banking.

The Mauritius Commercial Bank has establishments in the Colony, the total amount of deposits on 31st Dec., 1910, being Rs. 5,379,253.

The Bank of Mauritius (Limited) was established in October, 1894, with paid up capital of 125,550L., and opened in Mauritius in Dec., 1894. Total deposits up to end of 1910, Rs. 2,735,000.

A Government savings bank was established in 1837. The total deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1910, amounted to Rs. 1,234,427. The sum standing to the credit of depositors at end of June, 1910, was Rs. 3,000,028.

All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is the currency of the island. There are about Rs. 13,902,938 (in coin) in circulation. A Government note issue was re-established in 1876, the notes being legal tender except at the office of issue. The circulation on the 31st December, 1910, was Rs. 5,120,250.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Dependencies.

The dependencies of Mauritius comprise a large number of islands scattered over the Indian Ocean.

Rodrigues, the most important, is situated in latitude S. 19° 41' and longitude E. 63° 23', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a magistrate, who takes his instructions from the Governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the Governor of Mauritius in executive council. The population (census 1911) is 4,826. Cable communication, through a branch of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company, was opened on 16th May, 1902.

The island, which is volcanic, mountainous, and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good: sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla grow luxuriantly.

During the time of slavery fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years cultivation has been neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guinea fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmiste and vacoa trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and fruit.

Diego Garcia (population, 516), the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horse-shoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is a coral atoll, fifteen miles by six and a half, nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end, and from two to five miles in breadth.

Diego Garcia is situated at 7° latitude S. and between 72° and 73° longitude E., on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin. In 1885 it was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius, which was, however, withdrawn in 1888.
