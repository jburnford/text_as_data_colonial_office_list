SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Sierra Leone has a coast-line of 210 miles, extending between 6° 55' and 9° 2' of N. lat., from the territory of the Republic of Liberia on the south-east, where the Manoh River forms the boundary, as far as Kiragba on the north-west; about midway on this coast there is a block of land about 23 miles in length with a mean width of about 14 miles, forming the oldest portion of the Colony; about 100 miles south-east from this block there is another about 80 miles in length, with a varying width not definitely ascertained, forming the Sherbro District. The rest of the Colony consists of a strip of land along the sea and river shores of half a mile in depth inland from high-water mark in some places, and a quarter of a mile in others; and of the Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellaboi, Kortimo, Tasso, Macaulay, and other islets. The strip of shoreline was acquired for the purpose of securing an effective control over the importation of sea-borne goods into the main portions of the Colony.

Immediately adjoining the Colony of Sierra Leone lying to the northward and eastward is the Protectorate, the northern boundaries of which were defined by the Agreement between Great Britain and France which was concluded on the 21st January, 1895. The extreme depth from south to north is about 210 miles, lying between 7° and 10° N. lat., and the extreme breadth from east to west is 180 miles, lying between 10° 40' and 13° 21' of W. long. The estimated area of the Colony and Protectorate is 31,624 square miles.

History.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession by King Nembana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor, of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs, and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government," of a piece of land described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 22nd August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a party of natives of Africa, and some others, who from various circumstances had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were struggling waifs in and about London. Somewhat later the Colony was much used as a settlement for Africans rescued from slave-ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves. The territory of the Colony received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on the 10th July, 1807, King Farima and King Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the Colony; and in 1861 Bai Conteh, King of Kwaisi, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Kwaisi country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the Treaty of Cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with
the King and chiefs of Sherbro, Bagru, Sherbro Island, and some other places, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. This treaty was not ratified by the Crown, but was revived by a fresh agreement made in 1832. A number of other Treaties of Cession were made from time to time.

On August 21st, 1896, a Proclamation was issued of a Protectorate over the Hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate, which is divided into six districts as follows:

Headquarters District—Headquarters, Waterloo
Karene " " Batkanu.
Ronietta " " Moyamba.
Railway " " Kennema.
Koinadugu " " Kaballa.
Sherbro " " Bonthe.
Northern Sherbro " " Bandajuma (temporarily).

Of these, the Headquarters District is composite, in that it consists of territories which are partly in the Colony proper, and partly in the Protectorate.

General Description.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of volcanic mountains, running parallel to the sea from N.N.W. to S.S.E., the summits of which, in the Sugar Loaf and Leicester Mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of syenite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The parts on the banks of the rivers are low and swampy, while away from the rivers the country consists of low rolling downs, with here and there a range of hills some 3,000 feet in height. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa, the country is for the most part well watered by rivers and running streams. The principal rivers which empty themselves into the Atlantic on the Sierra Leone Coast are the Great and Little Scarcies, the Sierra Leone or Rokelle, the Sherbro, the Jong, and the Manneh or Mano, all of which are navigable for several miles.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 1,700 feet above the sea. In 1911 it contained 34,090 inhabitants. It possesses the best harbour in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining have a population (including Freetown and its Districts) of 75,370. It yields only a small quantity of exportable commodities. The extent of the territory is small, the generally rocky soil is not very well adapted for cultivation, and the people of the Colony seem not much attracted to that form of industry.

The Sherbro District exports considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piassava, with other articles of lesser importance. A large proportion of the exports of Sherbro are really the products of the Protectorate.

Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, indi-

rubber trees and vines, benni seeds, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, rice, and other tropical products. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa, the country is, for the most part, well watered by rivers and running streams, which are, however, not navigable. No minerals have been discovered, except iron, which can hardly be reckoned as of exportable value.

The population of the Protectorate is estimated at 1,307,132 and is composed of the following tribes:

Headquarters District—Temnes, Bulloms, Mendes
Temnes, Limbas, Susus,
Lokkos, Foulahs, Mandingoese.
Karene " " Ronietta " " Railway " "
Mendes, Temnes (including Yonnis), Sherbro.
Mendes, Konnohs, a few Kissias.
Koinadugu District
Korankos, Yalunkas, Limbas, Foulaha, Mandingoese.
Sherbro and Northern Sherbro Districts
Sherbro, Mendes, Krimis, Gallinas.

Constitution.

A Charter, issued on May 27th, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, established a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, revoked so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter, dated 17th of December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. According to the same letters patent, the Governor of Sierra Leone is aided by an Executive Council composed of four officials and the officer in command of the troops. The Legislative Council, of which the Governor is ex-officio president, is composed of the members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Collector of Customs as ex-officio members, together with the Senior District Commissioner and the principal Medical Officer as officials, but not ex-officio, members, and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

Climate.

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The temperature varies during the year from about 62° to 89°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur in the rainy season, especially at its commencement and close. They are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp. The rainfall in Freetown for the year 1910 was
133°44 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from N.E. to S.E.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is unhealthy, and malarial fever is prevalent. The general death-rate for Freetown was 22 per thousand in 1908, 19 per thousand in 1909, and 27 per thousand in 1910. A large proportion of this is due to a decreasing, but still heavy infantile mortality, which in 1909 was 368 per thousand.

It is estimated that there were 831 Europeans in the Colony in 1910, among whom there were 15 deaths.

Natives of West Africa suffer considerably from malarial fever, but the type is not so severe as among Europeans.

**Vegetable Products.**

The principal products exported from Sierra Leone are palm kernels, palm oil, benni seed (sesame), ground nuts, kola nuts, rubber, copal, ginger and hides. Most of the vegetable products are derived from wild plants. The chief agricultural work lies in the cultivation of rice and cassava for local consumption. The kola tree is found near almost every village, and from its product a considerable portion of the revenue of the native inhabitants is derived.

**Trade.**

There are practically no industries at present. The inhabitants of Freetown and the Colony generally are traders and shop-keepers, and do little in the way of agriculture beyond the planting of cassava. In the Protectorate the inhabitants plant farms, chiefly of rice and cassava, and collect natural products for sale to the various merchants and traders of the Colony. The staple food of the inhabitants is rice.

The products from the Protectorate which constitute the principal exports are palm kernels, palm oil, benni seed, ground nuts, kolanuts, indiarubber, copal, hides, and ginger. Cotton has for many years been cultivated by the natives, some of whom manufacture a considerable number of native clothes. The British Cotton Growing Association made an experiment in cotton growing on European principles, which was not successful, chiefly owing to the withering effect of the harmattan wind. The principal imports are spirits, tobacco, cotton goods, furniture, groceries, etc., and hardware. More than two-thirds of the total imports in 1910 came from the United Kingdom, which also received about one-fifth of the exports.

**Currency and Banking.**

Besides British currency, gold doubloons, eagles, and the coins of the Latin union are legal tender. There is no Colonial coinage, and no note circulation. The Bank of British West Africa has a branch in the Colony. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882, and had invested by the end of 1910, the sum of 90,162L.

**Education**

A system of Government grants and inspection was established in 1882. There are 78 assisted elementary schools in the Colony, with 8,549 scholars at end of 1910; they are all denominational, and charge fees. Education is not compulsory. There are five secondary boys' schools in Freetown—the Grammar School (C.M.S.), the High School (Wesleyan), the Educational Institute, and the Albert Academy (United Brethren in Christ). The Church Missionary Society has a training college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University. There are also in Freetown three high schools devoted to female education. A scheme for the education, on Western lines, of Mohammedan children was started in 1901. There are now five Mohammeden Schools or Madrasas in Freetown supported by the Government, with 754 pupils on the roll in 1910. A Government school for the sons and nominees of native chiefs was established at Bo in the Railway District of the Protectorate on 1st March, 1906, under European supervision. The number of pupils at the close of the year 1910 was 118. The foundation-stone of the Thomas Agricultural Academy at Mabang in the Protectorate, founded in accordance with the bequest of 60,000L by the late Mr. S. B. Thomas, a native of Sierra Leone, was laid in January, 1909.

**Means of Communication.**

Steamers leave Liverpool for Freetown every Wednesday. The average length of passage is 12 days to Freetown. There is also regular steam communication with Hamburg, Havre, Marseilles, and Lisbon.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively. The main line of the Sierra Leone Government Railway, which was the first Railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the Freetown terminus to Baiima in the Railway District, a distance of 220 miles. The number of stations on the main line is 29. Two tramways were opened for traffic in 1908, the one continuing the main line from Baiima to Pendembu, a distance of 7 miles, and the other running from Boia Station, 63 miles from Freetown, in a north-easterly direction to the Yonni terminus, 21 miles distant. The gauge of the Railway and Tramway is 2 ft. 6 in., and the same rolling stock is used on both. A number of roads have been constructed to act as feeders to the railway and tramways.

There is another line, known as the Mountain Railway, which connects Freetown with the cantonment for European Officials at the Hill Station, 6 miles distant.

There are also lines connecting the terminus with the Government Wharf, Government Quarry, Ascension Town Cemetery, and the Recreation Ground.

The total railway receipts for 1910 were 101,610L.; the working expenses of the main line for the same year were 79,846L.

There are 238 miles of telegraph, viz., Freetown-Baiima, Freetown-Hill Station, and Mano Station-Bendu (opposite Bonthe, Sherbro). Horses do not thrive.

The Sherbro river is navigable for over 20 miles (up to Yorktown), the Sierra Leone, or Rokell river, for 40 miles (as far as Magbile).

The rates of postage are as follows:
