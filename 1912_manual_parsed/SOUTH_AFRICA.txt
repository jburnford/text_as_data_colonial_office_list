SOUTH AFRICA.

The Union of South Africa is constituted under the South Africa Act, 1909 (9 Edw. 7, ch. 9), passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on the 20th September, 1909. In terms of that Act the self-governing Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony become united on the 31st day of May, 1910, in a legislative Union under one Government under the name of the Union of South Africa, those Colonies becoming original provinces of the Union under the names of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State respectively.

The Act constituting the Union provides for the appointment by the Sovereign of a Governor-General, who, with an Executive Council (of which the members are chosen and summoned by him), administers the executive government of the Union as the Governor-General in Council. Departments of State are established by the Governor-General in Council, the Governor-General appointing not more than ten officers to administer them. Such officers are King's Ministers of State for the Union and members of the Executive Council.

The Senate consists of forty members. For ten years after the establishment of the Union eight are nominated by the Governor-General in Council and thirty-two are elected, eight for each province. The first election was made prior to the establishment of the Union by the two Houses of each of the Colonial Legislatures sitting as one body, and a vacancy will be filled by the choice of the Provincial Council in respect of whose province a vacancy occurs.

The House of Assembly consists of 121 elected members, 51 of whom represent the Cape of Good Hope, 17 Natal, 36 Transvaal, and 17 the Orange Free State. Members of both Houses must be British subjects of European descent.

The qualifications of voters are the same as in the Colonies at the time of union, and no subsequent law is to disqualify any person in the Cape from voting, by reason of his race or colour, who could vote under the existing law, unless the bill is passed by both Houses together, with a two-thirds majority of the total membership. [In the Transvaal and Orange River Colony the franchise was restricted to white men; in Natal a native could obtain a vote, but under conditions which made this very difficult; in Cape Colony any native could do so who has a certain property qualification and can write his name.]

Pretoria is the capital and seat of government of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Legislature.

The first Parliamentary Election under the South Africa Act was held on the 15th September, 1910, and the Union was inaugurated by H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught, K.G.

Provinces.

A Provincial Council in each province has power to legislate by ordinance on certain subjects specified in the Act, and on such other subjects as may be delegated to it. The specified subjects include direct taxation for provincial purposes, the borrowing of money on the credit of the province, primary education (for five years), agriculture, hospitals, municipal institutions, local works other than railways and harbours, roads, markets, game preservation and other purely local or private matters. All ordinances passed by a Provincial Council are subject to the veto of the Governor-General in Council. Members of the Provincial Council are elected on the same system as members of Parliament, but the restriction as to European descent does not apply. The number of members in each Provincial Council is as follows:

| Province            | Number |
|---------------------|--------|
| Cape of Good Hope   | 51     |
| Natal               | 25     |
| Transvaal           | 36     |
| Orange Free State   | 25     |

The first Provincial elections for the Cape of Good Hope and the Transvaal were held on the 15th September, 1910; those for Natal and the Orange Free State on the 12th October, 1910.

The executive power in the subjects on which the Provincial Council is empowered to make ordinances is vested in an Executive Committee consisting of an Administrator, appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and four members elected by the Provincial Council.

Population.

The total population of the Union (white and black) as ascertained at the 1911 Census was 5,958,499—an increase of 782,675 on the previous Census in 1904. The total white population was 1,278,025—an increase of 161,219 over that of seven years previously.

Railways and Harbours Board.

The control and management of the railways and harbours, subject to the authority of the Governor-General in Council, are exercised through a Board consisting of a Minister of State as Chairman, and three Commissioners appointed by the Governor-General in Council.

The constitution of the Board on the 30th December 1910, was as follows:

- The Hon. Jacobus Wilhelmus Sauer, Minister of Railways and Harbours, Chairman.
- Sir Thomas Rees Price, K.C.M.G.
- Thomas Smith McEwen, Esq., A.M.I.C.E.
- Lt.-Col. Edward Mackenzie Greene, K.C., C.M.G.
- T. M. Berrangé, Acting Secretary.
The Chief Officers of the Administration are:—
Mr. W. W. Hoy, General Manager, Johannesburg.
Mr. A. J. Robb, Financial Secretary, Pretoria.
Mr. G. C. S. Clark, C.M.G., Assistant General Manager, Johannesburg.
Mr. W. H. Barrett, Assistant General Manager, Cape Town.
Mr. H. Salmon, Assistant General Manager, Cape Town (on leave).
Mr. D. B. Downie, Acting Assistant General Manager, Bloemfontein.
Mr. A. M. Tippett, M.I.C.E., Engineer-in-Chief, Johannesburg.
Mr. D. A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer, Pretoria.
Mr. G. A. Reid, Chief Accountant, Johannesburg.
Mr. C. Cock, Chief Railway Storekeeper, Germiston.
Mr. R. A. Simmons, Catering Manager, Johannesburg.

Railways.

The South African Railways include the lines of the late Central South African Railways, the Cape Government Railways and Natal Government Railways. On the 31st December, 1910, the length of open lines in the four Provinces of the Union of South Africa, viz.:—Cape, Natal, Transvaal and Orange Free State, was 7,041½ miles belonging to the Government, 645 miles owned by private companies, and a further 839 miles under construction.

The gross receipts of the Union Railways for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1910, amounted to £12,056,871l., as compared with £10,157,271l. for the previous year. The ordinary working expenses (i.e., exclusive of Renewals) for 1910 were £5,857,250l., and for 1909, £4,958,066l. Including Renewals the working expenditure was £6,597,911l. for 1910 as against £5,411,915l. for 1909.

The Government issues tariff books, corrected periodically, containing full information upon all matters of interest or likely to be of service to the public, such as fares, rates, distances, running of trains, etc.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Table Bay (Cape Town), Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. These ports are now under the direct control of the Department of Railways and Harbours.

Table Bay.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater 3,640 feet long and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 67 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 75½ acres, with about 2½ miles of berthing, and a depth ranging from 20 to 35 feet at low water. The normal capacity of the docks is 8,000 tons per diem. There is also a graving dock of 500 feet capacity on the keel blocks, with a depth of 24½ feet over the cill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T., and a slip is available for vessels up to 500 tons.

Port Elizabeth.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,160 feet long, and a third jetty, 1,460 feet long.

In addition to the above, there is an explosives jetty, 1,380 feet from the shore, with an aerial ropeway communication. This ropeway is capable of landing 150 tons per day.

East London.

The port of East London is situated at the mouth of the Buffalo River, the entrance being protected by a solid breakwater and training walls. The dock area is 100 acres in extent. Vessels drawing up to 24 feet draught and of over 8,000 tons gross register enter the river and discharge alongside the wharfs, the total length of which amounts to about 5,000 feet. A patent slip provides every facility for effecting repairs to vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight.

Durban.

Durban harbour is accessible at all times to the largest vessels navigating southern waters.

The harbour is approached through the Bluff Channel, 4,000 feet in length, formed by a north pier and a south breakwater. These works are 800 feet apart, except at the pier heads, where the breadth is only 600 feet. The average low-water depth at the entrance is 33½ feet, and in the harbour channels 30 feet. The land-locked bay inside these piers extends about 3½ miles east and west, and nearly two miles north and south. The wharves have a length of 2½ miles, with depths alongside of from 23 feet to 38 feet, 6 inches L.W.O.S.T. The deep-water space available for shipping covers about one-ninth of the area, and gives a low-water depth of not less than 30 feet over its greater part.

Sea and Land Communications.

The packets of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Union (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 9 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena and Ascension. The distance by sea from England to the Union varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail packets call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages. The St. Helena-Ascension service is performed by the intermediate steamers of the company, under agreement with the Imperial post office.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay, are also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A frequent service to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Savill, and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Lund's Blue Anchor Line, the White Star Line, and the German-Australasian Steamship Company.

There is a mail Service with Mauritius and East Coast Ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.), once or twice a month and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. There are also two direct lines of Steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is 26 days.
Communication is effected between the principal towns in the Union daily; with Rhodesia four times a week and with Lourenço Marques daily.

Mail trains leave Cape Town daily, one at 11.30 a.m. for the Transvaal via Kimberley, and the other at 8.30 p.m. for the Midland and Eastern portions of the Cape Province, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Natal. Return trains leave Pretoria daily, one at 9.30 a.m. via Kimberley, and the other at 7.45 p.m. via the Orange Free State, arriving at Cape Town at 6.55 a.m. and 6.0 p.m. respectively on the third day.

The 11.30 a.m. train from Cape Town is extended three times weekly to Vryburg, Mafeking and Bulawayo, and in addition the trains leaving on Tuesday and Friday connect at Kimberley with the "Zambesi Express," arriving at the Victoria Falls on Saturday and Tuesday. In the opposite direction the "Rhodesian Express" leaves Bulawayo on Wednesdays, Sundays and Fridays at 9.20 a.m., connecting at Kimberley with the ordinary train from the Transvaal, and arriving at Cape Town at 6.55 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. In addition an ordinary train leaves Bulawayo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 10.15 a.m., arriving at Cape Town at 6.0 p.m. Friday, Sunday and Tuesday.

On Tuesday and Saturday the "Transvaal Limited" train leaves Cape Town at 9.0 a.m. for Johannesburg and Pretoria, via Kimberley, and the return trains leave Pretoria at 5.40 p.m. on Thursday and Saturday, arriving at Cape Town on Saturday and Monday at 7.30 a.m.

On Thursdays the "Orange Limited" leaves Cape Town at 9.0 a.m. for the Transvaal via the Orange Free State.

In the opposite direction the Imperial Mail Train-de-Luxe runs via the Orange Free State, leaving Pretoria and Johannesburg on Monday evenings, reaching Cape Town on Wednesdays at 2.10 p.m., and going through to Cape Town Docks for the convenience of passengers for the mail steamer leaving for England on that day.

On Tuesdays a train conveying the European mails brought by the incoming mail steamer is despatched from the docks Cape Town to all parts of South Africa.

The Number of post and telegraph offices is 2,466 and of money order offices 654. The expenditure on the post and telegraph service amounted to £1,373,000 in 1910; the revenue was £1,406,000.

On 31st December, 1910, there was a sum of £6,063,899 standing to the credit of depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. Savings Bank business is transacted at all money order offices.

The telegraph system is well developed. There are 47,421 miles of telegraph wire and 38,832 miles of telephone wire open. The number of telegraph offices open is 1,231. There is direct overland communication with German South West Africa. Telephone call offices with Trunk facilities have been established over a greater part of the Union.

The Union is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent by the Western route, and via Zanzibar and Aden by the Eastern route, and with Australia, India and the Far East, via Mauritius and Cocos.

Marconi Wireless Installations have been established at Cape Town and Durban (Port Natal). They have an effective daylight range of 250 miles; this distance has been exceeded in night operations, which have been successfully carried out over more than 1,200 miles.

The rates of postage are:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Internal | ½ oz.     |
| U. K. India & British | ¼d. per 4 oz. |
| Colonies | 2½d.     |
| Other Countries | ¼d. per 2 oz. |

The weights and measures in use are British; besides which the there are the morgen = 2½ acres, the Cape foot = 1'03 feet, and the Cape ton = 2,000 lbs.

Customs.

The four self-governing Colonies prior to the operation of the Act of Union gave notice to the Administrations of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia of their intention to retire from the South African Customs Union Convention in terms of Article xxiii. of that Convention, with effect from 30th June, 1910; and subsequently, on the consummation of the Union of South Africa, an agreement was concluded with these Administrations to continue all the essential features of the previous Customs Convention, viz.:

(a) The free interchange of the produce and manufactures of the Provinces of the Union, and the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, excepting spirits and beers, upon which duties not exceeding certain rates can be imposed;

(b) The collection by and payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of the duties imposed by the late Convention Tariff on goods intended for consumption in the said Territories, or vice versa, subject to a collecting charge of 5 per cent.; and

(c) The payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of 95 per cent. of the duty collected on imported materials which are contained to an appreciable extent in Union manufactures, and vice versa, entered for removal to the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Union of South Africa, as the case may be.

The Agreement continues in force until the 30th of June, 1911, and thereafter for periods of twelve months, subject to three months' notice by either party of its intention to retire therefrom as from the 30th June following such notice. If, however, either party amend the Customs Tariff, or take any steps in conflict with the spirit and intent of this Agreement, the other is at liberty to retire forthwith.

For like reasons, a Customs Agreement has been entered into between the Government of the Union and His Majesty's High Commissioner on behalf of the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland. The agreement is in all essentials identical to that referred to above, except that instead of a collecting charge of 5 per cent on all duties collected, and the payment of 95 per cent. of any duty collected on imported materials contained in Union manufactures, the basis laid down in Section No. 12 of the South Africa Act, 1909, for the adjustment of duties between the parties to the Agreement is followed, viz.: The Treasury of the Union will pay out quarterly a sum in respect of such duties which shall bear to the
total Customs revenue of the Union in each year the same proportion as the average amount of the Customs revenue of such Territories for the three completed financial years last preceding the taking effect of the South Africa Act 1909.

The Transvaal Province continues, under the terms of the Transvaal-Mozambique Convention, to admit the products and manufactures of the Province of Mozambique, except spirits, free of duty, but such products and manufactures are liable to the Union import duty if removed to another Province in the Union or to Southern or North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland.

Pending legislation in respect of the Excise duties in force in the several Provinces of the Union, Customs duties, equivalent to the excise rates in force in any Province of the Union, are levied on Union distilled spirits imported thereinto. Again, in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, a surtax is levied on the consumption of imported spirits. Excise is levied by means of stamps on cigarettes manufactured in the Union, or in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland, when entered for consumption in the Union, or in these Territories, and an equivalent surtax is levied on imported cigarettes.

The principle of granting a rebate of duties on all goods the growth or manufacture of the United Kingdom is maintained; likewise of granting such rebate of duties to those British Colonies and Possessions which grant an equivalent rebate to the products and manufactures of the Union of South Africa.

All duties are rebated on goods in transit through any part of the Union to places outside the Union.

**Industries.**

The chief industries, apart from gold and diamond mining, are the production of wool, mohair, sugar, brandy, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco, fruit, lucerne, maize, tea, wattle bark, and the breeding of livestock and ostriches.

In addition to the above there has of late years been a satisfactory expansion of manufacturing enterprise in the matter of the ordinary necessaries of life as well as regards the requirements of the mining and building industries of the country. The Customs Returns for 1910 show that whilst there had been during this period a general increase of 30 per cent. in imports, articles of food and drink were only responsible for an amount of 7 per cent. Decreases were actually shown in the matter of butter and its substitutes, frozen meat, sugar and vegetables. The importations of cheese, bacon and ham, on the other hand, show the large increase of 18 per cent., whilst biscuits have risen by 21 per cent. and confectionery 26 per cent. In each of these directions it is satisfactory to know that attempts are being made to increase the local production. In Griqualand West the farmers are turning there attention to cheese making as a profitable undertaking, and a most excellent article is now being placed on the market.

The manufacture of bacon and ham is also being taken in hand in different parts of the Union—notably in Natal—where two of the principal Creamery Companies are already engaged in the business and are about to considerably extend their sphere of operations.

As regards blasting compounds, the bulk of the requirements of the mining industry in this direction are now being met by the three Explosives Factories at Modderfontein (Transvaal), Somerset West (Cape Colony) and Kynochs (near Durban). In regard to explosives as well as candles the more recent Customs statistics show a marked decrease in importation.

In the matter of building material, local manufacture has made great progress. Large works have been established chiefly at the Ports where the production of doors and window frames and other classes of joinery is increasing annually. In this connection it might be stated that the question of Forestry is receiving a good deal of attention at the hands of the Department, which has been established for this purpose. The natural Forests of the Cape and Natal are being placed under responsible supervision and new tracts of suitable land are being planted with timber. A good deal of private enterprise in this matter is everywhere noticeable. An area of approximately 7,000 acres in the Cape Colony has been planted by the Railway Department for the purpose of growing timber suitable for railway sleepers.

Box-making has for some years been carried on as a branch of the wattle bark industry in Natal.

The salt industry of the O.F.S. showed a production during 1910 of 41,151,600 lbs., valued at 30,940l. on the producing site. Increasing attention is now being paid to the production of table and dairy salt, and it is stated on good authority that the local supply is quite sufficient for all the wants of South Africa.

Amongst other promising industries of recent growth are the Pottery Works at Olifantsfontein, established chiefly through the instrumentality of Sir Thomas Cullinan, and the cement works near Pretoria. The potentialities of both undertakings are great and they constitute most promising contributions to the industrial activities of the Union.

An industry which is of recent but phenomenal growth is that of whale fishing at Durban. Two Companies are at present engaged in this work. They possess a fleet of nearly a dozen steam fishing boats and during 1910 they exported oil to the value of over 60,000l. The success of the industry has led to the attempted formation of several other companies whose operations will be more or less limited to the Natal Coast. A similarly successful whaling company is at present carrying on operations at Mossel Bay, and German South West Africa will shortly have its station. In Durban alone during the season of 1910, 531 whales were captured and converted into oil.

The quantity of wine produced in the Cape Province during 1904—the Census year—amounted to 5,686,672 gallons; spirits, 1,534,069 gallons; and vinegar 113,862 gallons; practically all consumed locally. In 1909 there were produced 3,467,354 gallons of wine and 669,798 gallons of brandy.

Ostrich farming is carried on largely in the Cape Province and to a less extent in Natal and the Transvaal. The annual value of the ostrich feather production of South Africa during 1910 was over 2½ millions sterling, with a selling value of at least 6 millions sterling.

The movement in the direction of the grading and sorting of wool is gradually becoming general throughout the Union. Every effort is being made to foster the movement and the Government has arranged for expert demonstrations at various centres of production. Efforts are also being
put forward to induce farmers to combine and organise their forces in developing both the production and the distribution of their produce. The above undertakings are carried on under the direct supervision of the Agricultural Department, which is also charged with the control of all matters connected with animal industry and diseases, diseases of plants, the suppression of insect pests, viticulture, horticulture, and all other subjects allied with agriculture. Among the other important works being carried out are the investigation of agricultural conditions by means of experimental stations, the distribution of new varieties of seeds and the diffusion of agricultural knowledge among the farming community by means of the publications of the Department. Well equipped Agricultural Colleges exist at Elsenberg in the Stellenbosch district at Cedare, near Pietermaritzburg, and Potchefstroom in the Transvaal. The establishment of a Central Agricultural College within the municipal radius of Pretoria is at present under consideration.

The export of maize which has been made possible by low sea freight and reduced railway rates, has proved of much advantage to the farming community. The recorded value of the export of this cereal during 1910 was £63,413, representing 178,000 tons. The grading of the grain is undertaken by the Government by means of special officers appointed for the purpose at each of the Union Ports.

The inspection of fruit intended for export is similarly supervised at place of shipment. The export of fruit for 1910 was valued at £34,714.

In Natal and the Transvaal the coal trade has assumed very large proportions. The output in the former case during 1910 was 2,482,249 tons, and in the Transvaal the output reached 3,785,668 tons. The figures for the Free State were 434,861 tons and for the Cape 88,873 tons. The amount of coal bunkered at the various ports was 1,599,465 tons, an increase of over 400,000 tons on the previous year. The increase, moreover, synchronises with a decrease in the net imports of coal from 59,029 to 52,250 tons during the same period.

The gold output of the Witwatersrand in 1910 reached the unprecedented value of £34,244,930. It is interesting to note that in 1887 the value of gold secured was £169,401. Ten years later this had risen to £16,240,630, and is to-day more than double.

The export of wattle bark during 1910 amounted to 41,344 tons, of a value of £219,433.

The output of tea for the last recorded year was 2,092,000 lbs., and sugar 82,900 tons. The total quantity of wool exported during 1910 was 121,672,255 lbs., of a value of £3,830,914.

Total value of the imports and exports, exclusive of specie and number of tons of shipping entered at the various ports, are as follows:

| Year | Imports | Exports | Tons of Shipping entered |
|------|---------|---------|-------------------------|
| 1906 | £31,075,830 | £42,843,495 | Cannot be stated. |
| 1907 | £26,841,517 | £47,984,178 | " |
| 1908 | £24,532,520 | £45,375,871 | " |
| 1909 | £27,355,877 | £50,813,872 | £9,857,081 |
| 1910 | £36,727,367 | £54,754,401 | £11,494,855 |

Mining.

The Union of South Africa has a valuable asset in its extensive mineral deposits, and considerable mining activity prevails in all the four provinces. Foremost amongst the minerals produced are gold, diamonds, coal, copper and tin, whilst a variety of base minerals, such as asbestos, graphite, magnesite, zinc, lime, salt and others are being produced in a lesser degree.

Gold and diamond mining are by far the two most important industries, and the Union holds the premier position amongst the gold and diamond producing countries of the world.

The total value of the mineral output amounted to £43,581,933 for the year 1910, the contribution by the various provinces being as follows:

| Province       | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Transvaal     | £35,426,586 |
| Cape          | £5,777,010 |
| Orange Free State | £1,667,802 |
| Natal         | £710,535  |

In connection with this production the mineral industry expended during the year ended December, 1910, some £17,495,000 on salaries and wages and £14,347,900 on stores and machinery, and the labour employed by the industry in December, 1910, was 34,977 whites and 258,932 coloured, distributed as follows:

| Province       | Whites | Coloured |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Transvaal     | 27,891 | 219,610  |
| Cape          | 5,034  | 17,456   |
| Orange Free State | 1,473 | 11,966   |
| Natal         | 579    | 9,901    |

Gold.

Gold was discovered in the Transvaal and Natal Provinces about 1868 and in the Cape some years later. Operations in the Orange Free State have up to the present not gone beyond the prospecting stage and the production of the Cape and Natal is negligible, amounting only to £20,637 for the former and £46,608 for the latter out of a total production of £290,079,463 for the Union, from the commencement of operations till the end of 1910. Vigorous prospecting and development work continues in all the provinces. Practically all the gold produced comes therefore from the Transvaal and the foundation of its present huge industry, which in the year 1910 accounted for more than one-third of the world's production, may be said to date from 1884, when the Witwatersrand conglomerates were discovered.

The production of gold amounted in 1887 to a value of £169,401, and rose steadily until 1898 when the Union's output reached a value of £16,241,134. The South African War then interfered with operations and it was not till the end of 1903 that the industry began to assume its former proportions, the output for that year being £12,628,104. Since then the yearly output has more than doubled itself amounting to £30,994,905, and £31,991,295, for the years 1909 and 1910 respectively, as compared to the world's output of approximately £93,500,000 for the latter year. The contribution of the Witwatersrand Mines to the output for 1909 and 1910 was £29,787,569 and £30,653,933 respectively.

The following are the values for the Transvaal for recent years:

| Year | Fine Ozs. | Value   |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1903 | 2,972,897 | £12,628,057 |
| 1904 | 3,773,517 | £16,028,883 |
| 1905 | 4,909,541 | £20,854,440 |
| 1906 | 5,792,823 | £24,606,336 |
| 1907 | 6,450,740 | £27,400,992 |
| 1908 | 7,056,266 | £29,973,115 |
| 1909 | 7,296,108 | £30,987,660 |
| 1910 | 7,527,108 | £31,973,123 |
In 1897 the average number of persons employed in gold mining in the Union was 9,600 whites and 69,300 natives. These numbers rose to 12,000 and 107,000 just before the war in 1899, and amounted to about 10,000 and 45,000 in December, 1902.

The following gives the labour force engaged in the gold mining industry in the various provinces during the months of December, 1910, and June, 1911:

|                | December, 1910 | June, 1911 |

The average daily wages paid in June, 1911, to skilled whites on the Witwatersrand Gold Mines were from 12s. to 38s. 8d., according to trade or occupation (contractors on shaft sinking earning over 50s. per shift).

The monthly wages for natives averaged 51s. 3d. on Transvaal Gold Mines, on Cape Diamond Mines 92s. 4d., on Orange Free State Diamond Mines 60s. 2d., and on Natal Coal Mines 44s. 8d. Housing and food are supplied to natives at the expense of companies except in the Cape where housing only is provided.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West in the Cape Province, in the Pretoria, Zoutpanberg and Klerksdorp districts of the Transvaal, and in the Fauresmith, Boshof and Kroonstad districts of the Orange Free State.

The first diamond was found by accident in 1867 in the Hopetown district, annexed to the Cape since 1876, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected.

In the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of the Cape Colonists from King William’s Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring provinces. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871 the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Molder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley.

Following soon on these discoveries, diamond mines were also located in the Fauresmith district of the Orange Free State.

Apart from spasmodic workings on the banks of the Vaal River and the operations of the various small companies and syndicates, the Transvaal did not enter the field as a producer of importance till after the year 1902, when the Premier diamond mine was discovered.

The stones obtained in the mines of the Transvaal are of inferior quality to Cape and Orange Free State stones. For example, at one period when Transvaal diamonds were selling at about 13s. per carat those from the other two provinces were averaging 42s. and 36s. respectively.

The largest diamond in the world, well known as the “Cullinan” diamond, was found in the Premier Mine (Transvaal). Its weight was 3,025 carats, or nearly 1¼ lbs.

According to available records, the value of the diamond output to December, 1910, was £140,915,000l., but statistical records for the earlier years are incomplete, and exportations of diamonds to date may safely be placed at over £150,000,000l. in value.

The production by the different provinces is as follows for the past four years:

| Year | Transvaal | Cape | O.F.S. |
|------|-----------|------|--------|
| 1907 | Carats... | 2,062,855 | 2,022,688 | 1,877,486 | 2,090,068 |

The labour employed by diamond mines in December, 1910, and June, 1911, was as hereunder:

|                | December, 1910 | June, 1911 |

| Cape           | 2,632  | 11,860   | 2,830  | 18,004   |
| O.F.S.         | 1,098  | 9,899    | 1,096  | 10,626   |
| TOTAL          | 4,497  | 31,711   | 4,723  | 39,884   |

These figures do not include individual diggers, of which there are several thousand.

Coal.

Large deposits of coal of various qualities are found in all four provinces. The Natal and Transvaal fields produce the better qualities and are also the most favourably situated with respect to the various markets.

Natal coal is mostly bunkered by steamers calling at Durban, or exported overseas to South America and Asia and to South African ports. The gold and diamond mines and other local industries, as well as the railways, constitute the markets for the coal produced in the other provinces.

The pit’s mouth value of coal produced in the Union up to the end of 1910 was, for the

| Province       | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Transvaal      | £11,722,988 |
| Cape           | £2,131,307 |
| Orange Free State | £887,498 |
| Natal          | £6,849,285 |

TOTAL... £21,581,078
The output of coal for the year 1910 was:

| Tons. | Value. |
|-------|--------|
| Transvaal | 3,974,376 | 987,260 |
| Cape | 93,280 | 59,808 |
| Orange Free State | 469,762 | 131,728 |
| Natal | 2,570,115 | 688,424 |

The average value per ton at pit's mouth was in December, 1910:

| s. d. |
|-------|
| Transvaal | 5 0 |
| Cape | 12 10 |
| Orange Free State | 5 6 |
| Natal | 5 9 |

The keen competition in the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal largely accounts for the lower prices obtained in those provinces as compared with the Cape price.

The number of persons employed in coal mines was, in December, 1910, and June, 1911, as follows:

| December, 1910. | June, 1911. |
|----------------|-------------|
| Whites. Coloured. Whites. Coloured. |
| Transvaal | 493 | 8,981 | 504 | 9,399 |
| Cape | 117 | 1,201 | 115 | 1,193 |
| O.F.S. | 97 | 1,608 | 101 | 1,600 |
| Natal | 535 | 9,564 | 517 | 11,248 |

| TOTAL | 1,242 | 21,354 | 1,237 | 23,440 |

Other Minerals.

Copper and tin are the only base minerals other than coal which so far have been exploited to any appreciable extent, and only the Transvaal and Cape Provinces contribute to the output of these minerals. Copper mining has been carried on in the Cape since 1852 in the neighbourhood of Port Nolloth, on the Western sea border, and some 8,000,000l. worth of this metal has been exported to date from this province. It was not till the year 1906 that success attended prospecting operations in the Transvaal for tin and copper and enabled this province to enter the list of producers. Operations quickly expanded and up to the end of 1910 tin and copper ore have been exported to the value of 712,414l. and 231,513l., respectively.

The Transvaal tin fields are situated in the Rustenburg and Waterberg districts to the west of the Pretoria-Pietersburg railway, whilst the copper propositions are located along the Northern boundary close to the Limpopo river.

Tin and copper ores were exported during the year 1910 to the value of:

| Tin. | Copper. |
|------|--------|
| Transvaal | 324,559 | 76,175 |
| Cape | 1,793 | 401,206 |

| Total | 326,352 | 477,381 |

The value of other base minerals produced in the Union during 1910 was 238,264l.

Labour employed on these base metal industries was in—

| December, 1910. | June, 1911. |

| Whites. Colrd. Whites. Colrd. |
| Transvaal | 337 | 3,457 | 390 | 5,038 |

| Natal | 13 | 122 | 13 | 99 |

| Total | 535 | 5,724 | 582 | 7,058 |

Miscellaneous articles produced (such as cement, machine-made bricks and pottery) amounted to 489,268l., and silver contained in the gold bullion exported was valued at 90,790l.

Geological Survey.

The Geological Survey of the Cape Province was begun in 1896. The area mapped includes all that to the south-west of a line drawn from Van Rhyn's Dorp to Humansdorp, and very nearly the whole of the area north of the Orange River, e.g.:—Bechuanaland, Griqualand West, and part of Gordonia. South of the Orange River the survey has been carried down to De Aar and Carnarvon. There have also been mapped the divisions of Allwal North, Barkly East, Herschel, Xalanga, Elliot, Glen Grey, Kentani, and portions of Wodehouse, Queenstown, Uitenhage, Alexandria, and Matatiele. Maps of some of these divisions have been published in the Reports for 1901 to 1907, but fifteen sheets of the geological map of Cape Province on the scale of 1,500 Cape roods (3½ miles) to the inch have been issued separately, e.g.:—five of the South-western districts, and ten of the Northern. Several other sheets are in course of publication.

The Geological Survey of the Transvaal, as at present constituted, commenced field-work in 1903. Since that year approximately 37,000 square miles of country have been mapped on a scale of 2½ miles to one inch, the area completed representing rather more than one-third of that of the whole Province, exclusive of Swaziland, including the mineral districts of Lydenburg and Pilgrim's Rest, the Waterberg Tin fields and the Middelberg Coal area, and the central portions of the Province. The work has reached the eastern border in the neighbourhood of Komatiopoort, and has been joined up along the western border with that of the Geological Commission of Cape Colony. The Witwaterrand Goldfield is being mapped in detail on a considerably larger scale than the rest of the Province.

In addition to the maps published in the Annual Report, eight sheet maps of the geological map of the Province have been issued, accompanied by Explanations, and 5 memoirs dealing with the geology and mineral resources of special areas.

Education.

In the South Africa Act, sec. 85 (iii.), it is provided that "Education, other than higher education, for a period of five years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides," shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the respective Provincial Councils.

For practical purposes it has been provisionally determined that all post-matriculation instruction shall be deemed to constitute higher education.

The Department of Education, under the Minister, is therefore concerned with:—

(1) (a) The University of the Cape of Good Hope, established by Act No. 16 of 1873. Registrar, W. Thomson, M.A., B.Sc., LL.D.

(b) The South African College, Capetown, founded in 1829, its affairs being established and regulated by Ordinance No. 11 of 1837, and Acts No. 19 of 1858, and No. 30 of 1861. These enactments were repealed by Act No. 15 of 1878, which makes provision for the future regulation of the institution. Registrar, A. D. R. Tugwell.
(c) Victoria College, Stellenbosch, incorporated by Act No. 9 of 1881. Acting Registrar, A. F. Markotter, B.A.

(d) Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, incorporated by Act No. 21 of 1904. Registrar, Rev. A. W. Brereton.

(g) Transvaal University College, Pretoria, incorporated by Act No. 1 of 1910. Secretary, D. C. Hafner.

(h) South Africa School of Mines and Technology, Johannesburg, incorporated by Act No. 4 of 1910. Principal, G. R. Thompson.

(i) Natal University College, Pietermaritzburg, incorporated by Act No. 18 of 1909. Registrar, David Robb.

(j) Teachers' Training Colleges.

(2) The Minister of Education also administers the Agricultural Colleges, viz.:—Elsenburg, Grootfontein, Tweespruit, Cedarapad and Pretoria, through the Department of Agriculture.

(3) And also Forestry, through the Department of the Chief Conservator of Forests.

Forests.

The total area reserved for forest purposes in the Union of South Africa is approximately 734,491 morgen (1,530,592 acres). The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests. The Union is divided into seven Conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knysna, Umtata, Pretoria, Maritzburg and Bloemfontein respectively, who is directly responsible to the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Union of Pretoria. The present annual importation of timber into the Union is about 2,000,000 cubic feet, mostly pine, derived from Europe and America, the balance being hardwood from Australia. There is at present a large importation of hardwood sleepers. Expenditure on Forests for year, 1910, 84,856l.; cash revenue 52,921l. Value of Gratis Issues from Forest Estate 38,039l. Total Revenue, 90,952l.

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PROVINCE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Province of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, and on the north-east by the Orange Free State and Natal Provinces. The Cape Province, with the Transkei, contains an area of 276,995 square miles, being over five times that of England. It extends from 36 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraaland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876, three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walfish Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the Colony by proclamation dated 7th August, 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, of which, by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed Governor. By proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayllif") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1894 the whole of Pondoland was annexed. Basutoland, now an independent Colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.

On 14th September, 1488, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later.
from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the Haarlem, was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonisation. Following these migratory colonists, a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III., c. II.) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress, owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted.

An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonisation as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of 50,000l. to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated, and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonisation of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were: (1.) General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. (2.) Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. (3.) Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion, preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in recent years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice is practically unknown except in the more elevated localities particularly of the north-east. The mean annual temperature at the Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, in 33 deg., 56 mins. S. Lat. and 18 deg., 29 mins. E. Long. is 62°2 deg., the mean maximum being 70°8 deg., and the mean minimum 53°5 deg.; the average rainfall for the last 70 years is 25°59 inches. Aliwal North 30 deg., 41 mins. S. Lat. and 26 deg., 40 mins. E. Long (4,330 ft. above sea level) shows a mean temperature of 59°2 deg., the mean maximum being 74°2 deg., and the mean minimum 44°1 deg.; the rainfall average of 42 years being 24°0 inches. At the Royal Observatory the warmest days occur in February, when the average maximum is 80°0 deg. F., and the coldest nights in July, with an average minimum of 46°8 deg. F.; at Aliwal North January is the warmest month, the day temperature averaging 84°4 deg., whereas in July, when the coldest nights are experienced, the mean average minimum is only 28°7 deg. F.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (November to April), in the Western districts during the winter months, while along the South Coast the rainfall is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the twelve months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.
Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1911, the final audited figures for which are not available yet, the total population of the Province was found to be about 2,564,000, comprising 1,257,000 males, and 1,307,000 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 883,000; Natives, 1,546,000; other coloured races, 435,000.

Cape Town, which had in 1891 a population of 51,251, had at the census of 1904 a population of 77,668, and with its suburbs, connected by rail and tramway, 169,641, as compared with 78,866 in 1891. The Cape division, which includes Cape Town, had, in 1865, a population of 50,064; in 1875, 57,319; in 1891, 97,283; in 1904, 213,167, of whom 120,475 were European or white, and in 1911, 197,000 of whom 98,000 were European or White.

The population of the other principal towns in 1911 is, approximately, Port Elizabeth, 31,000; Kimberley, 30,000; East London, 21,000; Beaconfield, 14,000; Grahamstown, 14,000; Uitenhage, 12,000; Paarl, 11,000; Oudtshoorn, 10,000; King William's Town, 9,000; Graaff Reinet, 8,000; Worcester, 8,000; Cradock, 6,500; Stellenbosch, 6,000; Somerset East, 5,000.

The following is a brief abstract of the 1904 census returns:

The number of persons of European descent has been estimated as follows:—Dutch and French origin, 230,000; English, Scotch, Irish, etc., 130,000; other Europeans, 16,000.

The European, or white, then, represents one-quarter, and the coloured races three-quarters of the total population of the whole Colony, whereof one-fifth is urban. The proportion of females is now 97·70 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 8·70. The number of inhabited dwellings was 455,999, of which 434 were not intended for dwelling-houses, though used as such.

Estimated Population, 1907.—The number of persons on the 31st December, 1907, is estimated at 2,507,500, made up as follows:—European or white, 610,680; other than European or white, 1,896,820.

Birthplaces.—2,274,130 persons had Africa for a birthplace, 118,377 Europe, 10,387 Asia, 3,011 America, 3,654 Australasia, 118 were born at sea, and the birthplaces of 127 were unknown or unspecified. 98·38 per cent. of the population are British subjects by birth.

Religions.—Protestants numbered 1,305,453; Catholics, 38,118; Jews, 19,537; Mohammedans, 22,623; other sects, 4,297; no religion, 1,016,255; unspecified, 3,286; and 235 persons objected to state their religion. Protestants may be divided as follows:—Dutch Reformed Church, 399,487; Gereformeerde Kerk, 6,209; English Church, 281,433; Presbyterians, 88,600; Congregationalists, 112,202; Methodists, 290,264; Lutherans, 80,902; Baptists, 14,105; other Protestants, 32,191.

Education.—The degrees of education possessed were as follows:

member. Members are elected by voters who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act, No. 9 of 1892, Cape) by possession of property worth 75l., or receipt of salary or wages of not less than 50l. per annum, but no one can be duly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation, and is a British subject by birth or naturalization. The number of registered electors in 1909 in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope was 142,367. The Registration Act, No. 14 of 1887, makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy, and further provision in the direction of improved machinery is made in the Parliamentary Representation Act, No. 19 of 1898, the Registration of Parliamentary Voters Amendment Act, No. 48 of 1899, the Parliamentary Indemnity Act, No. 5 of 1902, and in the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 6 of 1908.

Elections are conducted under the Ballot Act, No. 9 of 1892, as amended by Acts No. 48 of 1899 and No. 6 of 1908.

The Provincial Council of the Province consists of the same number of members (51) as are elected in the Province for the House of Assembly, and they are elected by the persons qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Assembly in the Province voting in the same electoral divisions. The procedure relating to the conduct of elections is similar to that of the House of Assembly.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and Crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of six to eight elective members, exclusive of the Civil Commissioner, who is usually also Resident Magistrate, as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns eighteen members, and where under Act 33 of 1908, the body is called "The Rural Council." The electors are the owners or occupiers of immovable property, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not less than 500l. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they also have important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They were 80 in number in 1910, and their receipts during the year amounted to 355,122l. Payments for the same period amounted to 326,966l. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an Ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of whom are elected annually by the ratepayers. Certain municipalities are under special Acts, but all Town Councils or municipalities under the General Municipal Act, 1882, have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There are 123 municipalities in the Province, the receipts from all sources during the year 1909 amounted to 1,164,712l. The amount of loans outstanding, 31st December, 1909 (excluding bank overdrafts), was 6,478,874l., and the assessed rateable value of fixed property was 54,866,101l. Payments during the same period amounted to 1,228,253l. The Controller and Auditor-General has no general control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 84 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 or 5 members elected annually by the voters registered for Parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1908-9 to 12,753l. 2s., excluding balances.

Land.

Those desiring to acquire Crown Lands in the Cape Colony must now either compete at public auction at the sales of surveyed lands held under Act 15 of 1887 from time to time as occasion seems to demand in the various districts of the Colony, or they must apply for certain specified areas or farms which have been set aside for selection under Act 37 of 1882 or Act 40 of 1895.

Both these Acts were designed to enable sons of the soil without means, such as the sons of farmers, to obtain land without necessitating the investment of capital, and they require the applicant to select and name the piece of ground he requires; and if his request be entertained, a licence for five years is issued at a rental calculated at 5 per cent. on the capitalised assessed value of the land. Upon the termination of the licence and fulfilment of the conditions respecting occupation and (in the case of Act 37 of 1882) cultivation, the licensee is entitled to a title deed under Act 37 of 1882 on quit-rent tenure, and, under Act 40 of 1895, on payment of the purchase price in instalments extending over 15 years, the balance of unpaid instalments and the survey expenses being secured by a mortgage in favour of the Government.

Act 37 of 1882 deals with small holdings, not larger than 250 morgen, and is suitable for districts in the vicinity of markets where la petite culture may be carried on profitably, but Act 40 of 1895 is rather applicable to cattle or sheep runs of 3,000 to 6,000 morgen in extent, and is most suitable for pastoral districts.
Under Act 15 of 1887, farms in extent varying from the cattle ranch to the market garden or town building lot are surveyed by the Government, and advertised for sale from time to time to the highest bidder at an upset price. The price is assessed at the current market value in the district, and is of course subject to enhancement by competition, but the terms of payment are very easy, one-fifth of the price at which the land is sold being payable within the first 12 months—viz., one-tenth within 6 months and one-tenth within 12 months, and the remainder being secured by a first mortgage at 4 per cent. The balance of the purchase price may, if the purchaser desires it, be paid at once, or in portions of not less than £50 at a time. In case, however, the purchase price is less than £25 the whole amount must be paid in cash at once, or in equal instalments extending over 3 years, and bearing interest at 4 per cent. per annum from the date of sale.

**Fisheries.**

A properly-equipped steam trawler, the *Pieter Faure*, was imported in 1897 with a view to opening up the Fishing Industry of the Colony. The trials made proved that large quantities of fish are easily procurable by trawling. Private enterprise has followed the prospecting work of the Government, and the trawling industry is now firmly established. The trout acclimatisation work is still being carried on with a most gratifying measure of success, and several rivers have now been opened for public fishing. During the prolonged period of depression which affected the late Cape Colony prior to the establishment of Union in 1910, the Colonial Government discontinued trawling undertakings entirely on its own account, and the *Pieter Faure* for a time was leased to private persons pursuing the industry under certain conditions. Later the vessel was withdrawn entirely from the trawling work and is now employed by the Union Government as a means of communication to the Government establishments on Robben Island in Table Bay. Until the advent of Union the control and administration of matters relating to fisheries in inland waters and on the coasts of the late Cape Colony (now Cape Province of the Union of South Africa), passed to the Provincial Government. In 1911 a Provincial Ordinance (No. 12,1911) was passed providing for the regulation of matters such as issue of licenses, protection of fish, closing of waters, netting, tackle, etc.

**Dependent Territories.**

**The Northern Border.**—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amaxosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the Special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now annexed to Cape Colony (see below).

**Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land,** as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885, the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas. Palir, chief of the Ametashezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The PondoMisi tribe, under the chiefs Umditshwa and Umhlonho, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umgikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Ponds, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umgikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umgikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigau and Nqwiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule, and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Nqwiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River
was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000l.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now within the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and had a revenue of £171,153l. in 1903-4, which was included in the ordinary Colonial revenue. They are grouped under one Chief Magistrate, stationed at Umtata.

Griqualand East has nine subordinate magistrates. Its population at the Census of 1904 was—Europeans, 5,901; Bantu, 212,069; mixed, 4,062.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, and East and West Pondoland, has fourteen subordinate magistrates. It has a population of—Europeans, 8,056; Bantu, 221,313; mixed, 1,327.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, has six subordinate magistrates. It has a population of—Europeans, 1,707; Bantu, 175,682; mixed, 197.

BRITISH BECHUANALAND.—On the 30th of September, 1885, the territories south of the Molopo river and of the Ramathlabama spruit were declared to be British territory under the name of British Bechuanaland, and a commission was issued to the Governor of the Cape to be its Governor, with power to legislate by proclamation. The territory was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 16th of November, 1895.

PROVINCE OF NATAL.

Situation and Area.

Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from Cape Town, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange Free State and Basutoland, and on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and Umtamvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,371 square miles, and has a seaboard of 376 miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. Pietermaritzburg is the seat of the Provincial Government, and has a population of 29,980, exclusive of H.M.'s troops; the largest town and only port is Durban, with 59,000 inhabitants, of whom 14,700 are natives, 13,900 Indians and other Asiatics, and 28,450 whites, the remainder being of mixed descent. (These numbers are now approximate only.)

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1636, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonise it. Tshaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingana, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Tshaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Boers obtained a decisive victory, and placed Mpande, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingana, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the South African Republic (as the Transvaal was at that time called) and Orange Free State on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other, Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and a Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotahe, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,754 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 45 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas: total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,970 square miles.

Zululand and Tongaland.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Tshaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Tshaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingana in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Mpande. In the latter years of Mpande Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Mpande's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetshwayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetshwayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetshwayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetshwayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating
from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetshwayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetshwayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king, not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inyenezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginhlou on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetshwayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetshwayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Thaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetshwayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatuze River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatuze and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetshwayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutus (the name by which the personal adherents of Cetshwayo—as distinct from the Zulus in general—were known), finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinuzulu, a son of Cetshwayo, as King; but it was soon checked, with the assistance of the Imperial troops, and Dinuzulu with his uncles Ndabuko and Tshingana were arrested, tried and convicted of high treason, and removed to St. Helena, while other offenders were tried on other charges, and imprisoned or fined. Dinuzulu and his two uncles were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1888.

In 1890 Tongaland and the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Mbikiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Tongaland, also called Maputaland,
which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongolo with the River Maputo to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Tongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

In 1906 a serious native rebellion broke out in the colony and spread to Zululand. It was suppressed by the Colonial forces, with assistance from detachments of volunteers from the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. A Commission was appointed to enquire into the native question generally, and the Commission's Report has since been published.

In 1907 there was a further recrudescence of unrest amongst the natives in Zululand, which was, however, easily suppressed without actual bloodshed. Dinuzulu, son of Cetshwayo, together with other chiefs and ringleaders, was arrested, and tried on charges of high treason, rebellion, sedition, murder, etc., and found guilty, though complicity in the murders of several noted loyalist Chiefs was not proved as against Dinuzulu. Dinuzulu was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, whilst other Chiefs were sentenced for longer periods and transported to St. Helena. It was generally believed that prompt action was the means of arresting what might have been a very serious conflagration.

**Constitution.**

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman-Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1846, other Letters Patent were issued making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first Ministry was appointed.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or rents property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony for three years, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 5l. per month, is entitled to vote.

The act constituting the Union of South Africa was passed by the Imperial Parliament on the 20th September, 1909, and Natal became a Province of the Union on the 31st May, 1910.

**Local Government.**

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, and Dundee, and local boards in Verulam, Greytown, Utrecht Vryheid, Estcourt, Charlestown, and South Barrow. Their total revenue in 1909 was £50,686/., their expenditure £518,154/., and their debt £3,749,538/.

**Native Affairs.**

In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime nulla in se. This system of government remains in operation at the present time under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11 of 1865; but at the same time, and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may in certain cases apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently, by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work so well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government, and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives
occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13, of 1875, the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903 to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is about 2,400,000 acres, the land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies at different levels. On the coast line it is sub-tropical. On the high lands it is very little hotter than English summer weather in the summer months; in the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced, and snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer, and the sky is bright throughout the winter months.

Malarial fever was epidemic in coast districts during 1905 and 1906, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the authorities, it has been stamped out, while very few cases have occurred inland.

The death rates of Europeans or whites, including those classed in the Census returns as mixed and others, at Pietermaritzburg and Durban for 1908 were 11·5 and 9·51 per thousand respectively, and for the Colony 8·87.

At the census of 1904, the Europeans numbered 97,109, or 8·8 per cent., of whom about 12,500 were Dutch, the rest being chiefly British, with the exception of about 4,500 colonists of German descent, of whom the greater portion are settled in the New Hanover and Lower Umzimkulu divisions.

As estimated at 31st December, 1909:

| Europeans or Whites | 92,643 |
| Mixed and others | 7,080 |
| Indians and Asiatics | 118,714 |
| All natives | 1,030,597 |

Total | 1,249,034 |

It is believed that about 55 per cent. of the present white population were born in the Colony. The approximate figures at the 1911 census are:

| Europeans or Whites | 99,000 |
| Natives | 952,000 |
| Other coloured races | 141,000 |

Total | 1,192,000 |

Education.

In the year ended 30th June, 1910, there were 578 schools under Government inspection—342 European, 25 coloured, 175 native, and 36 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of 31,972. There are 57 Government schools, and 501 Government-aided schools. Since the establishment of Union Education, other than Higher Education, which is controlled by the Union Government, comes under the control of the Provincial Administration, with the Superintendent of Education as permanent head of the Department, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. The expenditure on education, for the financial year 1909–10, amounted to £130,747l. 17s. 7d., and the revenue to £18,206l. 10s. 7d.

PROVINCE OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE.

Situation, Area, and Population.

The Province of the Orange Free State lies to the north of the Orange River and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and the Province of Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts.

The population, according to the census, which was taken in 1904, was 387,915, of whom 142,679 were white. The Census of 1911 shows the population as approximately 527,000, of whom 175,000 are Europeans or whites.

Bloemfontein is the seat of the Provincial Government.

History.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Mosheph was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the inrush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa. On the establishment of Responsible Government, July, 1907, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams became Governor of the Colony.

On the restoration of peace in 1902 Crown Colony Government was established, and continued till 30th June, 1907, when Responsible Government was granted. The election of the first Legislative Assembly took place in November, 1907.

The Legislature consisted of two Chambers—a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly, consisting of 11 and 39 members respectively.

On the 31st May, 1910, the Orange River Colony became, under the name of the Orange
Free State, a Province of the Union of South Africa, and is now governed in terms of the South Africa Act which constituted the Union of South Africa. Apart from the general control of the Union Parliament the Act provided that the control of certain specified matters should be vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

**Provincial Administration.**

Administrator, Dr. A. E. W. Ramsbottom, 2,000l.
Provincial Secretary, A. M. N. de Villiers, 900l.
Chief Clerk, R. A. Gregorowski, 550l.
Accountant, J. McKinley, 500l.

**Education Department.**

Director of Education, W. J. Viljoen, 1,200l.
Secretary, D. G. Conradie, 650l.

**National Hospital, Bloemfontein.**

Medical Officer, Dr. P. N. Vellacott, 700l. and quarters.

**Climate.**

The Orange Free State can be separated, roughly, into three divisions—viz., the western, the middle, and the eastern.

The western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile, but requires irrigation. Rainfall averages 14 inches.

The middle division, through which the main line railway runs, holds moisture longer than the western division, and will grow certain crops without irrigation. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock. Rainfall averages 18 ins.

The eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe. Rainfall averages 24 ins.

The heat, especially in the middle and western divisions, is great during the months of December, January, and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein, altitude 4,510 feet above the sea, has risen on individual days to 102° Fahr. at 12 noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 75° and the mean minimum 48°.

The eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein:

| Month | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May  | June |
|-------|------|------|------|-------|------|------|
|       | 4°04 | 2°93 | 2°87 | 1°88  | 1°01 | 0°54 |

|       | 0°44 | 0°42 | 0°87  | 1°37 | 1°32 | 2°33 |

Total for Year ... ... 20°02

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

**Land Settlement.**

The 1910-11 season has been better all round than the previous one, due principally to seasonable rains, thus providing winter pasturage for the stock. Prospects are still bright. The stock census return for 1910 shows a decrease in sheep of 3,239, and an increase in cattle of 8,221. There are 621 heads of families, of which 560 are of British and 71 of Dutch descent. The new Land Board, appointed by H.E. The Governor under the terms of Letters Patent granting responsible Government to the Colony, took up their duties on October 1st, 1907. The title deeds of 1,521,041 acres of land were transferred to the Board, the remaining unallotted and undeveloped land, amounting to 118,500 acres, passing to the control of the Government. Revenue received from settlers from October 1st, 1910, to September 30th, 1911, amounted to 90,300l., including payments on account of capital. Expenditure during same period in loans to settlers, development of land, administration expenses, etc., 67,800l. A large number of approved applicants still await available land under the Board's control.

**Education.**

Education, except higher education, as defined by the South Africa Act, 1909, is under the control of the Administrator of the Province for the Provincial Council, and is administered by a Director. From 1900 to 1905 the schools were managed, teachers were selected and appointed, and all
expenditure was borne by the Government. Local Education Committees were established in the towns in 1903, but these were merely advisory bodies. In terms of an agreement come to between the Government and representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church in March, 1905, the Christian National Schools, which had been started a year previously, were amalgamated with the Government Schools.

In 1908 a new School Act was passed and came into force on the 1st November. The principal changes introduced by this Act are as follows:

Fees are payable in respect of pupils at all primary and secondary public schools and aided private schools, provision being made for exemption in necessitous cases. English and Dutch are put on an equal footing as media of instruction in the various subjects of the curriculum, certain modifications being permitted according to circumstances during the first three years after the taking effect of the Act. With the exception of certain high schools, every primary and secondary public school is placed under the supervision of a committee consisting of five or seven members (according to the size and importance of the school) elected by the parents of children attending such school. The central local control in each district is vested in the District Board, which consists of nine members, the bare majority of whom are elected by the committees within the district, and the rest appointed by the Minister in charge of Education. Religious instruction can only be given by members of the school staff, and dogmatic teaching is prohibited during school hours, except in country schools when parents request that such instruction be given.

On the termination of hostilities in 1902 the total number of pupils attending permanent schools in the Orange River Colony was 1,933. Many children were then receiving instruction in the refugee camp schools. In June, 1903, when all the refugee camps had been broken up, the numbers in attendance at town and country schools in the Colony were 9,031. In 1910 the roll was 19,131.

Students are prepared for the B.A. and M.A. degrees, Law, Survey, Engineering and Pharmacy Examinations at Grey University College, Bloemfontein, new buildings for which have now been erected on an extensive site in the west of the city, where the Grey College School and hostels are also situated.

A normal school in Bloemfontein provides for the training of teachers, and bursaries are given on the results of an entrance examination held annually in April.

There is also an industrial school in Bloemfontein where orphans and sons of poor parents are maintained and supervised at Government expense, and apprenticed to various trades and industries in the town.

Courses of instruction are also given in agriculture at Grey College, in household economy at Eunice High School, and in cookery, dressmaking, art needlework and millinery in Bloemfontein and at various other centres in the Colony.

Spinning and weaving schools have also been started in several places throughout the Province, and have met with a considerable measure of success.

The above statement refers to the education and training of white people only. A small grant is also given annually in aid of the education of natives. This grant is paid to the various religious denominations which undertake the work of native education, and the amount is in proportion to the number of children in the schools. There are about 10,000 native children in these schools.

TRANSVAAL PROVINCE.

Situation and Area.

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange Free State Province and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and by the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal Province at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22° S. degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude.

Its area is 110,425 square miles, with a population, according to the census of 17th April, 1904, of 1,269,951, of whom 297,277 are whites, 937,127 aboriginal natives, and 35,547 other coloured races. The estimated population in 1910 was 1,400,000, of whom 350,000 were Europeans. The approximate population according to the Census of 1911, is:—1,677,000, of whom 421,000 are Europeans, 1,224,000 are Natives, and 32,000 belong to other coloured races. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea. The climate is healthy, except in the lower country, to the north and east, which is hot and often feverish. The winter is the dry, and the summer the wet, season. Heavy thunder storms are frequent in summer.

History.

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British Government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The
emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1853, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession, and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagoa Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1876, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000l. in Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,000l. were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetshwayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuana chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; a guerrilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.

The annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shepstone at the time had with him but a few mounted policemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not arrive in the province for some time after the English Government had been set up, with the apparent acquiescence of its people. But subsequently hostile feelings towards the annexation were widely manifested, and two deputations were sent to England after annexation, to represent those who were opposed to that measure and desired a withdrawal of the British Government. In each case the answer of Her late Majesty's Government was a decided refusal.

In December, 1880, a majority of the Boers took up arms against the Government, and hoisted the flag of the South African Republic at Heidelberg. The towns held by Imperial troops were immediately invested, and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, which was being withdrawn from Lydenburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force at headquarters, was surprised, and after suffering very heavy loss, compelled to surrender.

The towns, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy Colley, without waiting for reinforcements, collected the small force at his disposal and advanced from Pietermaritzburg in Natal to relieve them. A large force of Boers opposed his entry into the Transvaal at Laing's Nek, the path across the Drakensberg mountains.

On the 28th of January the English troops made a gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but they were driven back with heavy loss. The Boers followed up this advantage by cutting off Sir G. Colley's communications with Newcastle, with a view to prevent his receiving the reinforcements which had been sent out, and were now on the way up. To re-open his communications he crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked by the Boers. The action continued all day; at nightfall the Boers drew off, and the English forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being made by President Brand, of the Orange Free State, to bring about an understanding, and in reply to the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's Government, they declared that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition to the English troops, a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of all difficulties. This message was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent unopened to the headquarters of the Boers at Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to General Colley that no definite answer could be given to the message from Her Majesty's Government until Mr. Kruger's views were known. Dr. Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the 26th of February, General Colley, having received no reply to his message, moved out with three hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss, while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped, the rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Sir G. Pomeroy Colley himself was killed by a bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood, who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the advance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of President Brand, an interview took place on the 6th of March between him and General Joubert, who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek, which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice, with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr. Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E. Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's Government should allow the Transvaal self-government as regards its own interior affairs:
that the control and management of the foreign relations of the State should be reserved to Her Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident. The functions of this officer, and the provisions for the protection of the interests of the native population, were to be determined by Her Majesty's Government on the recommendation of a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to consider the whole question of the settlement of the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand was invited to be present at the conferences of the Commissioners with the representatives of the Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The sittings of the Commission were opened on the 28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recommendations of the Commission were submitted in detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the result a Convention was framed embodying the terms of the peace agreement, assigning the boundaries of the State, defining the functions of the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-general and chargé d'affaires, and conferring upon him extensive powers for the protection of the interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also formed the medium of communication between the Government of the Transvaal and the native States on its borders. Stipulations were made for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-commission, composed of the two judges of the High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident, was appointed to consider claims for compensation for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of August, and on the 8th of that month the Government was handed over to the representatives of the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Convention, and constant trouble occurred on the border, especially on the South-Western border, where the Bechuanaland tribes suffered severely from the incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal, which the Transvaal Government entirely failed to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to account by acquiring fresh territory in violation of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her Majesty's Government yielded to representations of the Transvaal Government and granted a new Convention, which was signed in London on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, became of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs, the Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX., to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen.

"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuanaland, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention. The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to 177,877l., had risen in 1890 to 1,229,061l., reaching 3,329,958l. in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time;
other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1895 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifts by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1895, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his intervention Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances, and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens' Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1898, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiators. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 10th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic, and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volksraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop (this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state); (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years' offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years' basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years' franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

After some correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the
British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 20th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslaagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnaissence from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Capetown for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R. Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chieveley after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enslin, and on the 28th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.

The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronje was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.

The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brebner, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further
resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions.

His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7), placing subsidised schools under the control of the Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (35, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation being accordingly by Ordinance.

On the 31st March, 1905, Letters Patent were passed providing for the constitution of a Legislative Assembly to consist of the Lieut.-Governor and not less than six or more than nine official members, and (provisionally) not less than thirty or more than thirty-five elected members. But in December, 1906, this Constitution was revoked and a new one substituted.

On 6th December, 1906, Letters Patent were issued conferring full responsible government upon the Transvaal. The legislature consisted of two chambers, the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the former containing fifteen members and the latter sixty-nine.

The Transvaal was included as an original Province of the Union of South Africa in terms of the South Africa Act, 1909, which came into
operation on the 31st May, 1910, and is now governed under that Act. Apart from the general control of the Parliament of the Union, the control of certain matters specified in the South Africa Act is vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Local Government.

The administration of municipal institutions in the Transvaal is now, by virtue of sec. 85 of the South Africa Act, 1909, vested in the Provincial Council, and all powers, authorities and functions relating to such institutions which at the establishment of the Union of South Africa were vested in or exercised by the Governor or the Governor in Council, or the Colonial Secretary of the late Colony of the Transvaal, are by sec. 81 of that Act vested in the Executive Committee of the Province.

Municipal Government was established in the principal towns of the Province by Ordinances enacted in 1903. These Ordinances have been extended and amended during the years 1904-1909 inclusive, and delegate to the local authorities very extensive powers. The Provincial Administration retains some measure of control, limited however to powers of audit and surcharge, also approval of loan proposals, local improvement schemes and the alienation of municipal property. Thirty-seven municipalities have been established, and considerable progress in the improvement of the towns has been made.

The basis of the municipal franchise is ownership of rateable property of the assessed value of £100, or the occupation of rateable property of the assessed value of £300, or of premises of the gross annual value of £24, but this franchise is not extended to aliens or to coloured British subjects.

The election of councillors of the various municipalities is by ballot, and in all the larger towns the procedure followed is based on the lines prescribed for municipal elections by the English Acts of Parliament. In the municipalities of Pretoria and Johannesburg the principle of proportional representation has been applied to the elections of councillors by Act No. 23 of 1909, the system being commonly known as that of the "single transferable vote."

Legislation as enacted in 1906 and 1906 provides for the creation of Health Committees, where the density of population makes it necessary in semi-urban areas for sanitary measures to be enforced. Eight of these committees have been established.

There is no system of local government for rural districts such as the system of Divisional Councils which obtains in other Provinces of the Union. Magistrates deal administratively with a number of matters which in other Provinces are administered by bodies popularly elected. Under Responsible Government, however, local Boards were created to assist the then existing Government in administering education matters, maintenance of roads, regulation of water in public streams and prevention of cattle disease. These Boards still exist under the Union, and are responsible, according to their functions, either to the Union Government or the Provincial Administration. Field cornets, who assist the magistrates in the administration of laws in the magisterial districts, were also introduced by Responsible Government in the local administration of the country districts, and are still so employed.

#### Finances.

The accounts of the Colony begin practically with the year 1902-3, and relate to annual periods between the 1st July and 30th June.

The loan of £35,000,000 raised in the year 1903, under a guarantee from the Imperial Government and under the authority of the Transvaal Guaranteed Loan Ordinance 1903, bearing interest at the rate of 3% per annum and with a sinking fund of 1% per annum, was allocated in terms of the Transvaal Inter-Colonial Conventions Ratification Act, 1908, between the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony in the following manner:

- Transvaal .................................. £27,317,592
- Orange River Colony ...................... 7,682,408

£35,000,000
The Transvaal portion has again been divided as between the Transvaal Government and the Central South African Railways Administration into two portions, namely, £12,834,716l. and £14,482,876l.

The interest, redemption and management charges on the first-mentioned amounts for the year 1909-10 were as follows:

| Interest | £384,397 |
| Redemption | £128,134 |
| Management | £3,222 |

As regards the Central South African Railways portion the charges above-mentioned were £435,125l., £145,042l. and £3,630l.

As regards the loan of £3,000,000l., also under an Imperial guarantee, and for which power to raise is contained in the Transvaal Guaranteed Loan Act, 1907, the total amount has now been raised. This loan also bears interest at the rate of 3½% per annum, and has a sinking fund of 1½% per annum.

The money so raised has been allocated for such purposes as the Land and Agricultural Bank, Railways, Public Works and General Agricultural Development and Settlement.

### HIGH COMMISSION

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa was created by Letters Patent in 1878. In 1879 a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland; but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who was also Governor of Natal (which now includes Zululand and Amatongaland). The High Commissioner for South Africa, who, under the Commission of 1889, was the officer for the time being administering the Government of the Cape, represents the Crown in all matters occurring in South Africa beyond the limits of the Colonies properly so called. He was, till 1899, charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, as well as those with native states and tribes outside the Colonies of the Cape and Natal, including Swaziland, which was administered by the Government of the South African Republic under the Convention of 1894.

The High Commissioner is Governor of Basutoland, supervises the affairs of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and of Swaziland, and exercises the control provided by Order in Council over the Administration of the British South Africa Company in Southern North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia. The Southern Rhodesia Order...
in Council, 1898, provides for a control by the High Commissioner over legislation, important appointments, and Native affairs in Rhodesia, and for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, who is paid from Imperial funds and acts as the local representative of the High Commissioner and the Imperial Government. The office of High Commissioner, which was formerly held by the Governor of Cape Colony, was, by a Commission dated Oct. 6th, 1900, vested in Lord Milner, by a similar Commission, dated March 15th, 1905, in Lord Selborne, and by a similar Commission, dated March 30th, 1910, in Lord Gladstone, who is also Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.

BASUTOLAND.

Situation and Area.

Basutoland forms an irregular oval in the north-east of the Cape Colony; the main axis, about 150 miles in length, lying in a north-easterly direction. The Orange Free State Province, Natal and the Cape Province form its boundaries. Its area is 11,716 square miles, or nearly as large as Belgium.

It lies between 29 and 30 degrees south lat., and between 27 and 28 degrees east long.

Description and Climate.

The territory, which is well watered, and enjoys an excellent climate, is the finest grain-producing country in South Africa, and the abundant grass enables the Basutos to rear immense herds of cattle. The scenery is grand, and in many parts extremely beautiful.

The Maluti Mountains, forming a part of the great Drakensberg chain, occupy most of the country, which is really one continuous elevated plateau, though broken and rugged. The extension of arable culture has tended to drive the cattle more and more into the high ground. The range of temperature during the year 1906-1907 was from a maximum of 93° F. to a minimum of 11° F., while the mean temperature for the year was 58°76° F. The rainfall for 1906-7 was 41°49 inches.

The climate is perfect for Europeans and natives alike, and when more easily reached the country will prove a great health resort. Its high altitude and pure atmosphere prove most invigorating. Phthisis pulmonalis is almost unknown except among the section of natives who have taken to wearing clothes, and Europeans who have come to the country on account of their disease. The latter in early stages of the disease improve at once. Persons suffering from malarial fever or its results are benefited greatly by a short residence in Basutoland. Leprosy imported from the Orange River Colony and Cape Colony has now a firm hold in the country, the proportion being about '91 per 1,000. As yet it has been possible to do little to check the spread of the disease.

Population and Industry.

In 1875 when Basutoland formed part of the Cape Colony, at the general census of the Colony taken in that year, the European population of Basutoland was 499, and the native 127,707. At the census of 1901 the population was estimated at 647 Europeans and 263,400 natives.

The census 23 April, 1911 (Preliminary Unaudited Returns) gave the—

| Natives | ... | ... | 404,421 |
| Whites  | ... | ... | 1,411 |

Maseru, the capital, and largest town, has a population of 861 natives and 500 whites (these figures are unaudited returns).

The productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron and copper, and coal has been found and used in some parts.

History.

The Basutos appear to have been composed of the remnants of several tribes which were broken up in the wars waged by Mosilikatze, the king of the Matabele, in the early years of the last century. These remnants were united in about 1818 under Moshesh, a chief of great ability, who ruled for many years.

In 1852 war broke out between Moshesh and the British Government; the Basutos were defeated by Sir G. Cathcart at the battle of the Berea Mountain, and Moshesh sent in his submission, and made peace.

A few years later, in 1856, disputes arose between Moshesh and the Orange Free State respecting boundary questions, and hostilities resulted which lasted from 1856 to 1858, with indecisive results, and were concluded by the Treaty of Aliwal, 1858, but collisions frequently recurred.

In 1865 the war broke out afresh, and Moshesh again claimed the protection of the Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse. He declined to interpose actively, but despatched a British Commissioner to Thaba Bosigo, the capital of Basutoland, to settle the difficulties. This measure met with little success, and in the end the Boers were successful, and Moshesh sued for peace. At the treaty of Thaba Bosigo, April, 1866, he recognised the permanent cession of a portion of his district and acknowledged himself a subject of the Orange Free State.

The peace was of short duration, the war was renewed, and the Basutos, pressed by the Boers, were on the brink of destruction, when they again appealed to be taken under the authority of the Queen, and in January, 1868, Sir Philip Wodehouse received authority to recognise Moshesh and his tribe as British subjects, and for the incorporation of their territory. This was carried into effect by a proclamation dated March 12th, 1868.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition, until it was annexed to the Cape, by an Act of the Cape Legislature, No. 12 of 1871. The Act expressly declared that Basutoland was not to be
subject to the general law of the Colony, and gave the Governor power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend to it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein.

The subsequent history of Basutoland was one of much trouble and disturbance.

In March, 1879, Moirosi, the chief of the Quithing district, in the south-east of Basutoland, rescued from justice his son Doda, who had been arrested for horse-stealing; and, on the Colonial authorities demanding his surrender, broke out into open defiance of its authority. Owing to the great natural strength of his country and stronghold, considerable difficulty was experienced in subduing him; but in December of that year his stronghold was carried by storm, and he himself fell in the assault. The proposals of the Colonial Government to divide the territory occupied by the adherents of this chief into lots for occupation by European settlers gave rise to great discontent among the Basutos who had remained loyal. This discontent was further increased by the extension of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, providing for a general disarmament, to Basutoland by proclamation in April, 1880, and culminated in the revolt of almost the whole tribe when an attempt was made to put the Act in force. The rebellion spread to the native territories east and south of Basutoland, East Griqualand, Tambookieland, and the Pondomisi, where the rising was signalised by the treacherous murder of Mr. Hope, the magistrate, and other Europeans.

Strenuous efforts were made by the Colony to reduce the Basutos to submission by force of arms, but without decisive success, though the loss of their cattle, and the interruption of cultivation, caused great distress amongst them. Early in 1881 overtures for an arrangement were made by the leading chiefs, and, at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, the High Commissioner acted as arbiter between the Colonial Government and the Basutos.

The terms of his award were, the registration of arms, the payment of compensation to those natives who had remained loyal by the tribe, and also the payment of a fine of 5,000 head of cattle. The award, was accepted by the Basutos and the fine paid, but little was done towards fulfilling the other conditions. The Colonial Ministry, with a view to facilitate a settlement, cancelled the award and induced the Cape Parliament to assume the burden of compensating the loyalists. The Disarmament Proclamation was also repealed, and at a Pitso held on the 24th of April, 1883, a very liberal constitution was offered to the Basutos. Masupha, however, the chief of the Berea district, with several other chiefs of influence, held aloof, and practically declared their intention to have no further connection with the Colonial Government, and the tribe generally were understood to wish to be under the direct authority of the Imperial Government. In the meantime a strong feeling in favour of the entire abandonment of Basutoland had grown up in the Colony, and on the request of the Colonial Ministry the Imperial Government decided to undertake for a time the administration of the country on condition that satisfactory evidence was given by the Basutos of their desire to remain under the British Crown, that the Orange Free State should undertake to cause the frontier to be respected by its subjects, and that the Colony should pay over towards the cost of administration the customs duties received on goods imported into Basutoland. This offer was accepted by the Colony, and provision was made in the Basutoland Disannexation Act of 1883 for the payment of 20,000£ a year, and the Free State also intimated its willingness to comply with the conditions so far as it was concerned.

A great national Pitso of the Basutos was held on the 29th of November, 1883, attended by the representatives of more than two-thirds of the whole tribe, who unanimously expressed their willingness to comply with the conditions on which the Imperial Government was prepared to assume the responsibility of the administration of the country. Several important chiefs who were not at the Pitso subsequently expressed their concurrence in this resolution, Masupha alone refusing to accept the offers of the Government, and desiring to remain independent. Her Majesty's Government upon this decided that their conditions were sufficiently complied with, advised the Queen to sanction the Disannexation Act, and immediately took steps for carrying on the government under the immediate authority of the Crown, from the 13th March, 1884. Masupha tendered his submission in 1886, and asked for a magistrate to be resident in his district.

**Constitution.**

The territory is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for South Africa, the latter possessing the legislative authority, which is exercised by proclamation.

The chiefs adjudicate on cases between natives, with a right of appeal to the Magistrates' Courts, where all cases between the natives and Europeans are brought.

For fiscal and other purposes the country is divided into 7 districts, namely, Maseru, Lcribe, Mohale's Hock, Berea, Mafeteng, Quthing, and Qacha's Nek. Each of the districts is subdivided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the Mosesh family. The revenue arises from the post office, native hut-tax, the sale of licences, and customs.

Serious crime is rare, and the drinking habits, which threatened to destroy the people, have been to a great extent abandoned owing to the influence of the missionaries, and the Government. There is not a single canteen in the country. The area under arable cultivation steadily increases, and there is less and less tendency to stock-thieving and petty warfare.

**Education.**

Excellent work is being carried on in the country by missionaries, in whose hands the labour of education is almost exclusively vested. There are 251 schools, with 15,397 scholars, a very large proportion being in the schools of the French Protestant Mission. There are four small Government schools, and grants in aid of education to the extent of 12,385£ were made for the year 1910-11.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no navigable waterways, the rivers being low in winter and flooded generally in summer. The usual mode of conveyance is by ox-waggon or light cart.

The roads in the country are now in good condition for any kind of transport, but the periodical rains draining down from the high watersheds seriously damage them. Bridges have been constructed across the Hlotse river, the Khomo-khoana river, the Caledon river at Ficksburg...
and the Little Caledon river near Maseru. A road and railway bridge has been built across the Caledon river at Maseru. New bridges are now completed across the Phutiatsana river near Teyateyaneng and the Mekhaleng river near Mohale's Hoek. There are no railways through the country, but in December, 1905, the Central South African Railways opened a branch line running from Marseilles station on their Bloemfontein-Middelpoort line to a point just within the Basutoland border, and close to Maseru.

The line of postal communication is through the Cape Province and Orange Free State Province. Letters to and from Europe take about 20 days, to Cape Town 3 days. Postal rates are similar to those of the Cape Province. The parcels post and money order systems have been extended to Basutoland. The telegraph stations are Hlotsi Heights, Teyateyaneng, Maseru, Morija, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek, Quthing, while a Government telephone line runs throughout the country to all Government stations.

Trade.

Imports for the year ended 31st December, 1908, amounted to £239,830., and the exports were estimated at £193,122. The imports consist chiefly of blankets, ploughs, saddlery, clothing, iron and tin ware, and groceries.

The exports consist chiefly of grain, cattle, wool, and horses. The commercial intercourse is almost exclusively with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State Province.

Basutoland from the 1st July, 1891, was admitted into a Customs Union with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State, by which arrangement a share of Customs duties collected at the ports of the Cape Province was credited to Basutoland, but retained by the Cape Government on account of the annual contribution of £18,000. This arrangement, however, has now lapsed, and in lieu of £18,000., the Basutoland Government receives its proper share of Customs dues.

The High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 10 of Aug. 5th, 1903, declared the admission of Basutoland into a South African Customs Union in terms of the Convention entered into in that year between Cape Province, Natal, the O.R.C. Transvaal, Southern Rhodesia, Basutoland, and Bechuanaland Protectorate. A new Convention was signed in 1906, but the position of Basutoland as a member of the Union remained unchanged.

Currency and Banking.

The Standard Bank has opened a branch in Maseru, and there are branches of Post Office Savings Bank at most of the Government Stations. The currency is exclusively British, but exchange, and occasionally the payment of taxes, is still largely conducted by barter.

BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE.

Situation and Area.

The territory of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the South and East by the Union of South Africa, on the North by the British South Africa Company's territory and the Zambesi and Chobe Rivers, and on the West by German territory. Its area is estimated at about 275,000 square miles, and the population, according to the census taken on the 7th of May, 1911, was 125,350, of whom 1,692 were Europeans or white.

History.

During the year 1885, Sir Charles Warren, who was in command of an expedition despatched from England to pacify Southern Bechuanaland, where for some time previously hostilities had been proceeding between the Bechuannas and Boers from the South African Republic, visited the
principal chiefs in Northern Bechuanaland (known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate), Khama, Gaseitse, and Sebele, and as a result a British Protectorate was proclaimed over their territories. No further steps were taken until the year 1891, when, by an Order in Council dated 9th May, the limits of the Bechuanaland Protectorate were more clearly defined, and the High Commissioner was authorised to appoint such officers as might appear to him to be necessary to provide for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue, and generally for the peace, order, and good government of all persons within the limits of the Order. Sir Sidney Shippard, the Administrator of Bechuanaland, was appointed Resident Commissioner, and an Assistant Commissioner was appointed for the Northern Protectorate, and another for the Southern Protectorate.

For fiscal and several other purposes the Protectorate was treated as a portion of the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland, until the latter was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 15th November, 1895. In the autumn of that year arrangements were made for the transfer of the administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, with the exception of certain reserves for native chiefs, to the British South African Company, and the Company's police were moved down to a camp in the Protectorate at Pitsani Potlogu. On the 29th of December Dr. Jameson, with his police, crossed the border of the South African Republic and marched towards Johannesburg, which was at the time in a state of great unrest, but being defeated by the Boers at Doornkop, surrendered on the 2nd January, 1896. In consequence of the raid, the administration of the Protectorate was not transferred to the Company. Since the annexation of British Bechuanaland to the Cape the Protectorate has been governed as a separate territory under the name of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and the form of government is very similar to that which obtains in Basutoland. There is a Resident Commissioner, who is under the direction of the High Commissioner, and there are two Assistant Commissioners, one stationed at Francistown, in the Northern Protectorate, and the other at Gaberones, in the Southern Protectorate. For the maintenance of law and order there is a force of police known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate Police, numbering 176. This force is under the direct control of the Resident Commissioner. There are 14 officers, 49 European non-commissioned officers and men, and 113 Basuto non-commissioned officers and men. There are also 10 Bechuana employed as messengers, and it is proposed to increase their number. The police are stationed in small detachments at various places in the Protectorate. The headquarters of the Administration is at Mafeking, in the Cape Province.

Climate.

The climate is delightful during the winter and fairly healthy during seven months of the year. During the summer months malarial fever is generally prevalent.

Native Chiefs.

The principal chiefs are:—

Khama, Chief of the Bamangwato, whose chief town is Serowe.

Sechele, Chief of the Bakwena, who lives at Molepolole.

Gaseitswe, Chief of the Bangwaketsi, who lives at Kanye.

Linchwe, Chief of the Bakhata, who lives at Mochudi.

Mathibe, Chief of the Batswana, who lives at Lake Ngami, near which at Tsau there is a Resident Magistrate and a small detachment of police under a sub-inspector.

Baitlotle, Chief of the Bamalete, who lives at Ramoutsu.

Means of Communication.

The main trunk railway to the North, which connects Rhodesia with Cape Town and which has now been extended beyond the Victoria Falls, runs through the Protectorate. The line north of Vryburg in the Cape Province is the property of the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, to whom, under an agreement made in 1894, the Protectorate Government was to pay a subsidy of 20,000£ a year for ten years, which has now lapsed.

Finances.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1905-6 | £28,653 | £74,783 |
| 1906-7 | 29,047 | 77,111 |
| 1907-8 | 31,563 | 75,851 |

| 1909-10 | 49,788 | 65,268 |
| 1910-11 | 52,067 | 64,791 |

There is no public debt, the annual deficiency being made good by an Imperial grant-in-aid.

The estimated expenditure for the year ending the 31st March, 1912, is 68,551£., and the estimated revenue 46,600£. To meet the deficiency an Imperial grant-in-aid of 10,000£. has been provided. The revenue is derived principally from Customs and Hut Tax, and the chief item of expenditure is police. Except in the case of importations from German South West Africa, no customs duty is collected in the Protectorate, but under an Agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Customs revenue, calculated on the average receipts for three completed years prior to Union, is received from the Union Treasury.

SWAZILAND.

Situation and Area.

Swaziland is bounded on the North, West, and South by the Transvaal, and on the East by Portuguese territory and Tongaland, now part of Natal.

Its area is approximately 6,536 square miles.

Description and Climate.

The territory is divided geographically into three longitudinal regions.

The mountainous region on the West approximates an altitude of over 4,000 feet.

What is known as the Middle Veld is some 2,000 feet lower, while the Low Veld, bounded on the East by the Lebombo Mountains, attains an average altitude of not more than 1,000 feet.

The first two regions are well watered and healthy, but the Low Veld cannot be described as either.

Mbabane, the headquarters of the Administration, is situated on the hills at an altitude of 4,300 feet, and Bremerdorp, the old capital, is on the Middle Veld. There are no other European villages.

History.

Swaziland, known to the natives as "Kwangwane," has been in the occupation of the Swazi tribes for a considerable period, and the present Ama-Swazi are no doubt the descendants of the early Bantu invaders, who occupied the country contemporaneously with the occupation of adjacent territory by allied tribes. The history of the consolidation into a nation of a congeries of tribes dates from early in the eighteenth century, when the adoption of a military organisation led to the dominance of one tribe over the others.

Certain "Medicine" and rain cattle were captured from Sikukuni by the Swazis, who lent assistance in the operations against that chief in the time of the first British occupation of the Transvaal, and the possession of this rain medicine has invested the paramount chief of Swaziland, in the minds of the natives of South Africa, with high authority as a rain maker.

The Swazis, while strong enough to repel a Zulu invasion, were nevertheless subject to the aggression of these neighbours, who, with the Boers, claimed authority over the country. In the Conventions of Pretoria (1881), and London (1884) Her Majesty's Government, however, expressly stipulated for the independence of Swaziland.

During the eighties the King "Mbandini" granted concessions for certain sums and periods. Every conceivable right was granted away, not only for land, minerals, grazing, and timber, but also for all imaginable purposes, including exemption from taxes, railways, telegraphs, mining patents, collection of the King's revenue, trading, etc., etc. All unallotted lands and minerals also formed the subject of concessions.

In 1888 a charter of self-government was granted to the whites in the country. Later, in 1890, under a Convention between Her Majesty's Government and the South African Republic, a provisional Government was, with the consent of the Swazis, set up, consisting of a Government Committee composed of representatives of those two Powers, and a representative of the Swazis, a Government Secretary, and of a Chief Court. This Court adjudicated on the initial validity of all concessions granted by the King, and, with few exceptions, confirmed the grants in respect of such initial validity.

In accordance with pledges given to the Government of the South African Republic the provisional Administration came to an end three years later, when the British Government signed a fresh Convention, which permitted the South African Republic to acquire from the Regent and her Council an Organic Proclamation conferring on the South African Republic rights of jurisdiction, legislation and administration without incorporation in the South African Republic. The Swazis never signed the Organic Proclamation which had been drafted for them, and accordingly its provisions, with some of those in the 1893 Convention, were embodied in the final Convention of 1894, under which the South African Republic exercised powers of protection, legislation, jurisdiction and administration in Swaziland, subject to the limitations of the Convention.

On the conquest of the Transvaal, all the rights and powers of the late South African Republic passed to His Majesty, but since the other party to the Convention of 1894 had disappeared without the limitations therein, an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act was issued in June, 1903, providing that the Governor of the Transvaal should administer Swaziland, and conferring on him the right to legislate by Proclamation.

On the cessation of hostilities a British Special Commissioner, with a small force of South African Constabulary, was sent into the country, and a provisional Administration was established.

In accordance with the powers granted to him, the Governor issued a Proclamation in 1904 providing for administration and for dealing with the concessions question. The Laws of the Transvaal in force at that date of the Proclamation were applied to Swaziland, mutatis mutandis. Courts were established with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the Transvaal, and an appeal was permitted from the decisions of the chiefs in civil matters to the Court of the Resident Magistrate. The chiefs were otherwise confirmed in their civil jurisdiction over natives, subject to the exclusion of usages incompatible with the due exercise of His Majesty's power and jurisdiction, or clearly injurious to the welfare of the natives.

The Commission constituted under the Proclamation of 1904 to deal with the concessions examined the concessions granting exclusive
rights, except exclusive rights to land and minerals, with a view to their expropriation at their value prior to the commencement of hostilities. The Commission reported in 1906, and the concessions, the subject of its report, were, with a few exceptions, expropriated. The Commission has now dealt with the question of boundaries of land, mineral and grazing concessions. The general survey of these concessions, necessary to determine the conflicting rights, is now complete. The Proclamation of 1904 further provided for the settlement of the rights of the natives, which in a modified form, is now completed.

By an Order in Council, dated 1st December, 1906, His Majesty's Government transferred the control of Swaziland from the Governor of the Transvaal to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Under the Order in Council the High Commissioner issued a Proclamation in March, 1907, providing for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, a Government Secretary, Assistant Commissioners and the establishment of a Police Force. The Laws of the Transvaal were re-enacted, mutatis mutandis, and, except where modified by Statute, the Roman-Dutch Common Law was put in force by the Proclamation. Besides the Courts of the Resident Commissioner and Assistant Commissioners, a Special court was established to deal with serious civil and criminal cases in which Europeans are concerned.

The paramount chief and other chiefs were confirmed in their Civil Jurisdiction over natives subject to appeal to the Resident Commissioner's Court. Provision was made for the Swaziland Deeds Office and Surveyor-General's Office to remain at Pretoria under control of the officers responsible prior to the date of the Proclamation.

**Population.**

The population of Swaziland is, according to the census of 1911, 1,083 whites and 98,876 coloured.

The Swazi are a kindred race to the Zulu. They have easily accessible markets for their labour, both locally and in the Transvaal, but their efforts in this direction are spasmodic.

The paramount chief is "Sobhuza," a boy of about thirteen years of age. His grandmother, "Nabotsibeni," widow of "Mbandini," acts as Regent, and has the assistance of a council of chiefs. A few of the principal chiefs are:

- Nogcogco Dhlamini, brother of Mbandini.
- Jokovu Dhlamini.
- Malunge Dhlamini, son of Mbandini.
- Ndabazwe Dhlamini.
- Silelo Nsubande.
- Makambane Fakude.
- Sihlelo Madhluli.
- Ntshingili Simelana.
- Tikuba Dhlamini.

The English Church Mission, The South Africa General Mission, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission, the African Methodist Episcopal Mission, the Wesleyan Methodist Mission, and the Independent Methodist Mission have representatives in the country.

The Administration has a native school at Zombodi, the kraal of the Regent, at which the young paramount chief attends, and has schools for European children at Mbabane, Bremerdorp, Ferreiras, Hluti, and Paradys.

**Industries, Agriculture & Trade.**

Mining in Swaziland is carried on under the authority of Concessions granted by the late King Mbandini. Gold is worked at several Mines near the western border. Tin is found in payable quantities in the vicinity of Mbabane. The Crown owns a few mineral areas, some of which it is proposed to throw open to the public for prospecting and mining. The following is the output of tin and gold for the last four years.

| Year | Tin (tons) | Value (£) |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1907-8 | 535       | £49,568  |
| 1903-9 | 526       | £42,005  |
| 1909-10| 446       | £28,368  |
| 1910-11| 476       | £42,250  |

| Year | Gold (ounces) | Value (£) |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 1907-8 | 3,108        | £13,203  |
| 1908-9 | 6,749        | £28,689  |
| 1909-10| 11,202       | £46,747  |
| 1910-11| 13,543       | £57,530  |

The native crops consist of maize, millet, sweet potatoes, ground nuts, etc., grown in insufficient quantities to meet local demands. With the completion of the general survey of Concessions and the definition of rights a slight advance in farming by Europeans has taken place. Experiments have been conducted in cotton growing with encouraging results. Tobacco is grown in small quantities and has given a good return. The Government Horticulturist of the Transvaal has reported very favourably on the prospects of fruit growing. He was especially impressed with the suitability of the climate and soil for citrus fruits and mangoes.

There are approximately 59,000 head of horned stock, and 90,000 native sheep and goats in the territory. Over 100,000 sheep (Merinos) are brought in each year from the high veld for winter grazing, but this class of sheep is not farmed in Swaziland during the summer months.

No statistics of the imports into and the exports from Swaziland are now kept. By an agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Swaziland is dealt with, for Customs purposes, as a part of the Union. Payments due to Swaziland are assessed on the proportions which the average of the collections for the three years ended March 31st, 1910, bear to the total customs collections of the Union in each year. The imports consist principally of maize, flour, groceries, wearing apparel, hardware, spirits and tobacco; while the principal exports are Cassiterite Tin and Raw Gold.

There is a branch of the National Bank of South Africa, Limited, at Mbabane, as also a Post Office Savings Bank. The currency is British.

Stores exist where necessary to serve the needs of the population, but the volume of trade is small.

**Revenue and Expenditure.**

The revenue and expenditure for the year ended March 31st, 1911, was

- Revenue: £63,722
- Expenditure: £62,257

The public debt on March 31st, 1911, was £100,000.

RHODESIA.*

Rhodesia (so called after the late Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes) is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in its Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese Dominions." Of these extensive territories the Company is now responsible for the administration of the following portions:

1. Southern Rhodesia, or the provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland (area 148,575 square miles).
2. Northern Rhodesia, or the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the Nyasaland Protectorate. The area is estimated at about 201,000 square miles.

I.—SOUTHERN RHODESIA.

The limits of Southern Rhodesia, as defined by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 20th October, 1898, are the parts of South Africa bounded by the Portuguese Possessions, by the Transvaal Colony to a point opposite the mouth of the River Shashi, by the River Shashi to its junction with the Tati and Ramaquaban rivers, thence by the Ramaquaban river to its source, thence by the watershed to the Rivers Shashi and Ramaquaban until such watershed strikes the Hunter's Road (called the Pandamatenka Road), thence by that road to the River Zambesi, and by that river to the Portuguese boundary. The said limits include an area of ten miles' radius round Fort Tuli, but exclude the area of the district known as the Tati district as defined by the Charter.

II.—NORTHERN RHODESIA.

This territory was previously divided into two provinces:

(a.) Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.
(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.

By the order in Council, dated 4th May, 1911, these two provinces were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. The amalgamation took effect from 17th August, 1911. The limits of the territory as defined by the order in Council are "the parts of Africa bounded by Southern Rhodesia, German South-West Africa, Portuguese West Africa, the Congo Free State, German East Africa, Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa."

History.

On the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

* The information in this notice is kindly supplied by the British South Africa Company.
Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lobengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Macloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was duly reached, and Fort Salisbury, 12 miles South-east of Mount Hampden, having been founded (12th September, 1890) the pioneers were disbanding, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims and farms.

In July, 1893, the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives living under the Company's protection, near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland, to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's police and a large force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the north and east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's forces near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lobengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Shangani, and Major Wilson with a small party of men were, after a heroic resistance, killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from small-pox or fever.

In 1896, owing to a variety of causes, the Matabele broke out in rebellion, and shortly after the Mashonas followed suit. After a prolonged struggle the rebellion was subdued in September, 1907.

The rinderpest, which for several years had been devastating Africa, travelling slowly through the continent from north to south, made its first appearance in Matabeleland in February, 1896. The adoption of the drastic regulations which the administration decided to enforce had to some extent checked the progress of the epidemic, when the outbreak of the rebellion put a stop to all precautionary measures.

In March, 1898, a system of compulsory inoculation for rinderpest was established, and the precautions taken have proved very effective.

From 1897 to 1899 the development of the country advanced rapidly, but the outbreak of the war with the Republics, in October, 1899, practically put a stop to progressive work of every kind, and for months the territory was completely cut off from the south.

On the outbreak of hostilities Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir Robert) Baden-Powell was in supreme command of all the forces in Southern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. When Mafeking was invested the command of the Rhodesian forces devolved upon Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir H. C.) Plumer, who was stationed at Tuli with a force of 450 men. In November, 1899, Martial Law was proclaimed in certain districts in Matabeleland, and, at a later date, in the whole territory, and the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers to the number of 800, were called out for active service.

At the beginning of January, 1900, Colonel Plumer moved his column to Palachwe and assumed direct command of the troops in the Protectorate, amongst whom were included 600 Volunteers and over 400 men of the British South Africa Police. Mafeking was successfully relieved by Mahon and Plumer's united columns on the 17th May.

In the early part of 1900 a force of 5,000 men, consisting of Australian, New Zealand and Canadian Volunteers, and English Yeomanry, was despatched to Rhodesia, via Beira, under the command of General Sir Frederick Carrington. This force was sent to the front as speedily as possible, two companies of Militia Infantry being retained at Bulawayo as a garrison.

The Administration of Southern Rhodesia estimated that the number of men contributed by Rhodesia was approximately 1,500, being at least 12½ per cent. of the European population. Despatches which have been published bear testimony to the good work performed by the Volunteers, Police, and the Rhodesia Regiment, and they also gained the special approbation of the late Commander-in-Chief.

The attitude of the natives throughout the war was most satisfactory, and, although in some districts there appeared signs of unrest, it was confined to attempts by discontented natives to work up the feelings of the people, who were, however, not affected by them to any appreciable degree.

Martial Law in Southern Rhodesia was withdrawn on the 26th July, 1902.

Constitution.

In 1888 that portion of Rhodesia now known as Southern Rhodesia was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 24th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1899, a resolution was passed agreeing to accept the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government to be made in the original Charter of the Company by a Supplemental Charter, and a further resolution was passed approving certain alterations in the original Deed of Settlement of the Company. These resolutions were confirmed at a further Extraordinary General Meeting, held on the 10th of January, 1900.

The Constitution of Southern Rhodesia, originally laid down by the Charter, was subsequently amended by the Orders in Council of the 9th May, 1891; 30th July, 1891; and 18th July, 1894, the latter being known as the "Matabeleland Order in Council." This Order was revoked by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1898, which provides for the Administration of the Territory, Legislation, the Preservation of Peace and Order, the Constitution of Courts of
Justice, and Native Administration. This Order has been amended by the Southern Rhodesia Orders in Council of the 16th February, 1903, 16th August, 1909, and 4th May, 1911. Under the Order of 1898, as amended, there is a Resident Commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State. To assist the Administrator there is an Executive Council, composed of not less than three members appointed by the Company, with the approval of the Secretary of State. A member of the Executive Council holds office for a period of three years, unless sooner removed by the Company, but is eligible for re-appointment at the end of each term of office. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of the Administrator (President), five nominees of the Company approved by the Secretary of State, and seven members elected by the Registered Voters. The Resident Commissioner sits on both the Executive and Legislative Councils, but without a vote. Ordinances passed by the Legislative Council, when assented to by the High Commissioner, take effect immediately, but within a year may be disallowed by the Secretary of State. The duration of each Legislative Council is three years. The first Legislative Council was elected in 1899. The number of Registered Voters in 1908 was 5,291.

By a Proclamation, dated 10th June, 1891, the laws of the Cape Colony in force on that date were adopted for and are administered in Southern Rhodesia as far as the circumstances of the country will permit, unless amended or repealed by the Legislative Council. The laws of the Cape Colony passed subsequent to the 10th June, 1891, do not apply to Rhodesia.

For the administration of justice there is a High Court with civil and criminal jurisdiction, the judges being appointed by the Secretary of State, on the nomination of the Company. In the districts there are Magistrates' Courts. Appeals from the High Court lie to the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, and thence to the Privy Council.

The administrative system of Northern Rhodesia is prescribed by the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council of 4th May, 1911.

Local Government.

Salisbury and Bulawayo were constituted municipalities in October, 1897. Sanitary Boards are appointed for the other principal towns.

Native Administration.

The Native Department of Southern Rhodesia is administered by the Secretary for Native Affairs, the duties of the office at the present time being undertaken by the Administrator. The two provinces are each under the control of a Chief Native Commissioner (who is responsible to the Secretary for Native Affairs), and are divided into native districts, 19 in Mashonaland and 13 in Matabeleland. Each district is in charge of a Native Commissioner or Assistant Native Commissioner, who is appointed by the Administrator, with the approval of the High Commissioner, as laid down in the "Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," and whose duties are defined by the High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 55 of 1910 (promulgated 14th October, 1910).

Formerly the natives were scattered throughout the country, but now land has been reserved for tribal settlements which is suitable for their agricultural and pastoral requirements.

The only tax imposed upon them is an annual hut-tax of £1. Excellent provision has been made for those who go to work at the mines. Compounds have been erected and hospitals provided at most of the mines, which are periodically visited by Government Inspectors; their contracts are supervised by officials who see that the terms are faithfully fulfilled by the employers, and in the event of injustice they have their remedy in a court of law under the "Master's and Servant's Ordinance." A native at the mines can easily earn from 30s. to 3l. a month with food and lodging.

Climate.

The Rhodesian plateau lies at an altitude of from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. Broadly speaking, the year has two divisions, the wet and the dry season. The early rains of the wet season (which is the summer) gradually appear towards the end of October, and increase in frequency and force until about the end of April. From May to September there is practically no rain. Taking into consideration the vast extent of the territory the climate naturally varies. In the highlands it is very healthy and bracing. Formerly, in the low-lying districts, malarial fever was very prevalent, but with the opening up of the country, better housing and food, it is rapidly disappearing. The summer is not oppressively hot, nor is the winter very cold. The average shown by the maximum and minimum thermometers in the shade at the principal towns, during 1910, was:

| Town     | Max. | Min. |
|----------|------|------|
| Salisbury | 76°8 | 51°2 |
| Umtali   | 80°6 |      |
| Bulawayo | 76°7 | 53°3 |

Rainfall.

| Town     | Rainfall |
|----------|----------|
| Salisbury | 28·14 inches |
| Umtali   | 23·87 "   |
| Bulawayo | 17·95 "   |

There are hospitals at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, Victoria, and Gwelo, each supplied with a complete staff of doctors and nurses. Cottage hospitals have also been erected in various districts to meet the wants of the mining centres.

Population.

A census for Southern Rhodesia was taken on the 7th May, 1911, showing the number of Europeans to be 23,582 (Mashonaland, 12,543; Matabeleland, 11,039). The native population was 743,640 (Mashonaland, 497,165; Matabeleland, 246,475). There were also 2,249 Asiatics and other coloured persons. The European population of Northern Rhodesia on the same date was 1,434, and the native population is estimated at about 1,000,000.

Chief Towns.

The chief towns of Southern Rhodesia are Salisbury (the capital), Umtali and Victoria in Mashonaland; and Bulawayo, Gwelo and Tuli in Matabeleland. Townships have also been formed at Rusapi, Gwanda, Selukwe, Hartley, Enkelloorn, Melssetter, Gatooma, Umvuma and at other places.

Salisbury, the seat of the Government, has a white population of 3,479. The town stands 4,700 feet above sea level. Branches of the
Standard Bank, Bank of Africa, and African Banking Corporation have been established.

Bulawayo is the commercial centre of Southern Rhodesia, with a white population of 5,200 and stands 4,469 feet above the sea level. Branches of the same banks as at Salisbury have been opened. There is a municipal hospital, which is one of the finest in South Africa. The town is on the main line of railway from Cape Town to the far north, and is distant from Cape Town 1,362 miles.

Railways.

The Bechuanaland Railways (now Rhodesia Railways, Limited) reached Bulawayo on the 19th October, 1897, and the line to that town was formally opened on the 4th November. An extension of the Beira Railway from Umtali reached Salisbury on the 1st May, 1899, and was opened on the 22nd May. On the 1st August, 1900, the widening of the gauge of the Beira Railway to 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa, was completed. On the 6th October, 1902, the line was completed between Salisbury and Bulawayo, a distance of 301 miles, thus establishing through communication between Cape Town and Beira (over 2,000 miles). The line passes through the mining districts of Hartley, Schakawe, Gwelo, Bembezi, etc. The railway from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls (282 miles) on the River Zambesi was completed on the 25th April, 1904, and the further extension northward, via Kalomo, to the Broken Hill Mine, 374 miles from the Falls, was opened for traffic on 1st September, 1906. Another section of the line from Broken Hill to the Congo Border (132 miles) was completed in December, 1909, by the Rhodesia-Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company, Limited. There is, therefore, through communication between Cape Town and the northern border of North-Western Rhodesia, a total distance of 2,149 miles. A further extension to the Star of the Congo Mine, in the Congo State (167 miles), has been constructed by the Compagnie du Chemins de fer du Katanga. The Zambesi river is crossed by a bridge 650 feet long, 30 feet wide, and about 420 feet above the level of the water. The structure was formally opened by Sir G. H. Darwin, K.C.B., President of the British Association, on the 12th September, 1905. A line from Bulawayo to the West Nicholson mine in the Gwanda district (120 miles), to open up the gold and coal areas to the south-east, has been constructed, and a line, with a 2-feet gauge, from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine in the Lomagundi district (84 miles), was opened for traffic on the 1st November, 1902. A branch (12 miles) has been made from this line to the Eldorado Mine. A line from Gwelo to Selukwe (24 miles) was completed in August, 1903, and one from Lyndhurst Halt (near Gwelo) to Blinkwater, (50 miles), was opened in June, 1909. A railway from Salisbury to the Jumbo Mine in the Mazoe district (about 22 miles) has been constructed and a survey is now being made for an extension of this line to Shamva in the Salisbury district, a distance of about 50 miles from the Jumbo Mine. A line to the Matopos, where Mr. Rhodes is buried, was opened for traffic on November 1st, 1903.

The total mileage of the Rhodesian Railway Systems (including the Beira Railway) at the end of 1911 was 2,357 miles.

Lands and Agriculture.

In 1897 a geodetic survey of Southern Rhodesia was initiated under the superintendence of Sir David Gill, K.C.B., H.M. Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, and was completed to the Zambezi river, in August, 1901.

Unimproved land in Southern Rhodesia may be purchased from the British South Africa Company outright for cash, subject to the fulfilment of a simple occupation condition, or it may be held under a permit of occupation with option of purchase for cash, or by instalments, at any time within ten years. The average price for this class of land is at present about 2s. 6d. an acre. The title deed gives the purchaser the freehold to the land subject to an annual payment of quit-rent, which is roughly 1l. per 1,000 acres. Applications for land should be addressed to the Director of Land Settlement, Salisbury, Rhodesia. Information and handbooks can be supplied by the Rhodesian Emigration and Information Office, 138, Strand, London, W.C., or the Emigration and Information Office, 140, Buchanan Street, Glasgow.

Special steamship and railway facilities are given to bond side farmer settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for the benefit of the farming community.

Considerable tracts of land have been placed under cultivation, and fresh stock is being imported. It may be said that virtually the whole of Southern Rhodesia is well watered, and adapted for stock-raising and for agriculture. Cattle generally do very well in all parts. Sheep and goats thrive in many parts and will do better after the grass is fed down. Pigs thrive well, and, so far, have never shown disease. Poultry and eggs always command a ready sale at remunerative prices. Throughout the country the conditions of soil and climate are suitable for all kinds of European cereals and vegetables, and, in addition, many trees, shrubs and plants peculiar to sub-tropical regions can be successfully cultivated. Melonies, Kaffir-corn, and other native cereals grow well in the rainy season without irrigation. Tobacco culture has now passed the experimental stage, and the industry is being rapidly developed. The plant grows luxuriantly, and a considerable acreage is under cultivation. There is every prospect of an early export trade being created in maize and tobacco, and later it is hoped to export other products such as fibres, rubber and cotton. Large fruit orchards have been planted, and nearly all fruit trees thrive. The sale of dairy produce is a profitable industry in the neighbourhood of the towns.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails from the United Kingdom to Southern Rhodesia are conveyed by the mail steamers of the subsidised Union-Castle Company, weekly, between Southampton and Table Bay. From Cape Town they are conveyed by train to Bulawayo in three days. There are also daily mail and passenger trains from Cape Town to Bulawayo performing the journey in four days. From Bulawayo to Salisbury the mails are conveyed three times a week, the journey occupying about 24 hours. There are two mail and passenger trains weekly between Salisbury and Beira, the time occupied on the journey being 30 hours.
The outlying districts of Southern Rhodesia are served by mail coaches and carts, but the mails to the less important districts are conveyed by native runners.

Northern Rhodesia receives its mails via Bulawayo. They are conveyed from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls and Broken Hill by train, and to the several postal stations in the territory by native runners.

Mail matter may, however, still be forwarded to Fort Jameson and other stations in the Eastern portion of the territory by the Chinde and Blantyre route. The time occupied in the transmission of the mails between Fort Jameson and the United Kingdom is now five weeks and two days.

On the 31st of December, 1910, 77 post offices were open in Southern Rhodesia, at 34 of which Money Order and Savings Bank business was transacted. Telegraph Money Orders are also exchanged between Money Order Offices in Rhodesia and with the United Kingdom, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony.

The rate for inland letters is 1d. per ½ oz., and the same rate to other parts of South Africa. The rate for letters for places over-sea was reduced from 2½d. to 1d. per ½ oz. from 1st April, 1911. The rate for letters from the United Kingdom to Rhodesia is 1d. per oz.

The Rhodesian Telegraph and Telephone system extends from Ramathlaba, on the northern border of Cape Colony, to Ujiji in German East Africa, and comprises 7,935 miles of wire, on 4,404 miles of poles. The section of line from Umtali to Ujiji (1,595 miles) is the property of the African Trans-continental Telegraph Company.

On the 31st December, 1910, 100 telegraph offices were open, including 12 offices in the Bechuana-land Protectorate. The rate for Inland telegrams is 1d. per word; for telegrams exchanged between Rhodesia and other parts of South Africa, 2½d. per word; and for cablegrams to Europe is 2s. 8½d. per word. Telegrams from Europe and from South Africa, for the Portuguese province of Manica and Sofala, Portuguese East Africa (including Chinde and Quilimane), the Nyassaland Protectorate, North Eastern Rhodesia, and for German East Africa, all pass over the Rhodesian lines.

Telephone exchanges are in operation at 12 towns and mining centres.

Post Office Savings Banks were established on 1st January, 1905. Up to 31st December, 1911, the amount deposited was £357,845, and the amount withdrawn was £269,097. £88,998 has been invested in Trustee Securities.

Customs.

Prior to the 1st August, 1899, no duties were leviable upon goods entering Southern Rhodesia. On that date the Customs Ordinance came into operation, and continued in force till August, 1903, when, as a result of the South African Customs Conference, the necessary Ordinance empowering Southern Rhodesia to enter the newly formed Customs Union was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council. This Convention of 1903 was superseded by that of 1906. The Tariff was amended in 1908. On the 30th June, 1910, the Customs Union was terminated by mutual consent, but an agreement has been entered into between Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa, by which the tariff remains unaltered. The following is the value of the declared imports into Southern Rhodesia during the past ten years, together with the amount of duty collected:

| Year ended | Value | Duty |
|------------|-------|------|
| 31st March, 1902 | £1,443,063 | £123,158 |
| 1903 | £1,858,569 | £128,673 |
| 1904 | £1,576,619 | £128,387 |
| 1905 | £951,698 | £105,934 |
| 31st Dec., 1905 | £1,213,776 | £128,250 |
| 1906 | £1,340,687 | £162,739 |
| 1907 | £1,450,174 | £171,120 |
| 1908 | £1,818,372 | £200,348 |
| 1909 | £2,214,014 | £213,693 |
| 1910 | £2,786,321 | £274,085 |

Exports from Southern Rhodesia during the past five years:

| Year ended | Value |
|------------|-------|
| 31st December, 1906 | £2,111,002 |
| 1907 | £2,174,236 |
| 1908 | £2,735,885 |
| 1909 | £3,178,416 |
| 1910 | £3,199,956 |

An Ordinance was promulgated on 1st October, 1901, imposing a duty of 6s. per gallon on spirits manufactured in South Africa, and imported into the Territory. Another Ordinance was also promulgated upon the same date imposing an excise duty of a similar amount upon spirits manufactured within Southern Rhodesia.

Minerals.

GOLD.—That gold was obtained from Rhodesia many centuries before the Christian Era is evidenced from the innumerable “ancient workings,” the ruins of temples and forts supposed to date from the time of the Himyarites and Phoenicians, and the discovery of gold beads, gold plates, fine chains, wire, nails, etc. From the occupation of the country in 1890 by the British South Africa Company when the European population amounted to about 200 persons, consisting of the pioneers and a few officials, up to September, 1898, the gold produced only amounted to 6,470 ounces. Since that date, however, the output has been steadily increasing, and the following table shows the progress made:

| Year | Bullion | Estimated Value |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 1902 | 194,170 | £687,096 |
| 1903 | 231,872 | £827,729 |
| 1904 | 267,737 | £969,343 |
| 1905 | 407,048 | £1,449,985 |
| 1906 | 551,894 | £1,985,099 |
| 1907 | 612,052 | £2,178,886 |

| Fine Gold |
|-----------|
| 1908 | 606,961 ozs. | £2,562,007 |
| 1909 | 623,389 | £2,623,708 |
| 1910 | 609,956 | £2,568,198 |
| 1911 | 628,521 | £2,647,896 |

From the 1st April, 1908, all results are declared in ounces of fine gold instead of in bullion.

COAL.—For some years past coal has been known to exist in several districts. In the Wankie District, 212 miles from Bulawayo, and 70 miles from the Victoria Falls on the River Zambesi, a coal bed of large extent is being worked. The result of careful and systematic examination shows that as regards quality the coal is only from 4 to 6 per cent. inferior to Welsh steam coal of similar quality. During the year 1911...
the output amounted to 212,529 tons, as against 180,068 tons in 1910. Other promising discoveries of coal have been made in the Victoria, Tuli and Sebungwe districts, also in North-Western Rhodesia, but, so far, sufficient exploratory work has not been carried out to admit of a final opinion being pronounced as to their precise value.

The output of silver during the year 1911 was 187,641 oz., and for 1910 217,633 oz. The output of lead in 1911 amounted to 639 tons, and for 1910 745 tons.

Copper.—Discoveries of copper have been reported in the Victoria, Lomagundi and Melsetter districts in Southern Rhodesia, and highly promising deposits have been disclosed both in North-Eastern and North-Western Rhodesia.

During 1905 diamonds were discovered in the Gwelo district, and 7,020 carats had been declared up to the 31st December, 1911.

Amongst other minerals, 74 tons of wolframite ore, 147,007 tons of chrome iron ore, 49 tons of scheelite and 1,119 tons of asbestos have been exported up to 31st December, 1911.

Education.

On the 31st December, 1910, there were in Southern Rhodesia 33 state-aided schools. During the year eleven new schools have been added and two have dropped out owing to migration of the population. The total number of children in Government-aided schools was 1,623 as against 1,212 for the previous year. The total expenditure from Government funds amounted to £23,980, and £1,832. was received in respect of tuition fees. The number of native schools which received Government grants during 1910 was 115 as compared with 80 for 1909.

During the year 1910 two High Schools (one for boys and one for girls) have been opened both in Salisbury and Bulawayo, which provide an education fully equal to the best secondary schools in England. The number of pupils enrolled has far exceeded expectations.

Owing to the munificent bequests of the late Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Beit, largely increased educational facilities are now afforded. Scholarships and Bursaries are granted to pupils in the country, and, in addition, there are nine "Rhodes Scholarships" (three per annum) by which a Rhodesian can secure a three years' course at Oxford University.
