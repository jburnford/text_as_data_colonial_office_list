**BARBADOS.**

**Situation and Area.**

Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most easterly of the Caribbee Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, somewhat larger than the Isle of Wight.

**History.**

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who, finding it uninhabited and rude in appearance, named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig-trees which they found. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship Olive Blossom in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1625 or 1627 (the exact date is uncertain), Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I., fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their Governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I. of all the Caribbee Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300l. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfortone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as Governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The Leeward and Windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

**General Description.**

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, in latitude 13° 5' 42".
North, and longitude 3° 58' 29" West. This town contains, according to the census of 1921, 13,486 inhabitants. Speightstown, the only other town, has about 1,500 inhabitants.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or carenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. It is a port of registry, and had registered, on 31st December, 1921, 46 vessels, of a total net tonnage of 11,545 tons.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as off the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation.

A geological map, with explanatory memoir of the island, was published in 1891 by Messrs. J. B. Harrison and A. J. Jukes Browne, which shows that that area of the island called the Scotland district, which is the part enclosed by a semi-circular sweep of the ridge in the north-east, is composed of sandstones, clays, and infusorial earths, the products of which may be in future a valuable source of revenue to the island; already excellent fire-bricks are made near the end of the railway.

In Schomburgk's history of Barbados there is a short reference to the deposit of asphaltum found in the island, and Messrs. A. J. Jukes Brown and J. B. Harrison casually mention it as occurring occasionally in small quantities, which planters have attempted to burn under their sugar boilers, but not with sufficient success to lead to its general use. In 1896 an American named Julius Pinney suggested to Mr. Walter Merivale, M.I.C.E., late managing director of the Barbados Railway, the possibility of mining it for commercial purposes. A mine was opened by Mr. Merivale on the College Estate in January, 1896, from which about 500 tons of the purest asphaltum were extracted during the year 1898. Other mines have since been opened, and in 1921 the total amount of manjak exported from the island was about 109 tons, of the value of £2,844, prices averaging about £2½. a ton.

Much of the geological information concerning the coral area was obtained from borings, &c., made by the Barbados Water Supply Company, whose operations were undertaken with a view to supply the rural population of the different parishes with water up to a height of 750 feet above sea-level. The town of Bridgetown was supplied for many years with an adequate supply of good water by the Bridgetown Water Works Company.

Both companies have been bought up by the Government, and the works have now been extended to all the parishes of the island.

Traces of oil have been discovered in certain districts and experimental borings are being carried out by the British Union Oil Company, Ltd.

Owing to the steady Easterly Trade winds, which blow almost continuously from December to June, the climate is bracing and the heat is never oppressive. During the remainder of the year, the wet season of the Island, the heat is seldom excessive, although the absence of the Trade Winds render the climate less invigorating. The average temperature is 79°8', and rainfall 61 inches.

The Island is largely visited as a Health resort by residents of neighbouring West Indian Colonies and British Guiana. It is, to a considerable extent also utilised as a winter resort by visitors from temperate climates. Generally the Island is extremely healthy; it possesses the unique advantage in the West Indies of being completely free from malaria, the Anopheles mosquito being unknown.

Industry.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. In 1919 there were 195 sugar-works in operation. The produce exported has been as follows:

| Year | Sugar | Molasses |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1919 | 50,812 | 7,689,830 |
| 1920 | 34,736 | 6,712,930 |
| 1921 | 26,344 | 4,191,471 |

The area under sugar cultivation is estimated at 74,000 acres. In September, 1898, the island, in common with St. Lucia and St. Vincent, suffered severely from the effects of a disastrous hurricane. In 1902-3 there was an epidemic of small-pox, which caused a prolonged quarantine and seriously affected trade. Cotton-growing has been revived, with help from the Colonial Treasury and the British Cotton-growing Association, and under the guidance of the Imperial Department of Agriculture. In 1920, 148,980 lbs., of the estimated value of £6,314, were exported to the United Kingdom.

Population.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939. By the census of 1891 the population was returned at 182,306. By the census of April, 1921, the population was 156,312 the decrease, as compared with the figures for 1891, being attributed to the large numbers of the labouring classes which have from time to time emigrated to Panama in connection with the Canal Works, while many others have gone to Para, Brazil, Cuba, the United States of America and Canada in search of more remunerative employment than what can be obtained locally. English is universally spoken. Labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in sterling, and British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, and there is but little gold in circulation. There are three banks doing business in Barbados, the Colonial Bank, capital paid up £90,000 sterling, and the Royal Bank of Canada, with a paid up capital of £4,194,600. Total number of branches of the Colonial Bank throughout West Indies 13, with deposits of about £1,600,000, and a note circulation (five dollar notes) of £350,000. In Barbados the estimated circulation is £50,000. A branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce was opened in 1921. There is a Government savings bank, which had, on 31st December, 1920, 13,057 depositors, and deposits amounting to £686,975.

There is an appreciable amount of American gold and notes in circulation, the gold coins are eagle or ten dollars, valued before the war at 2l. 1s., half-eagle or five dollars, 1l. 0s. 6d., quarter eagle or two and a half dollars, 10s. 3d., and the dollar 4s. 1d. Notes of the same amounts were cashed at the same values respectively.
Internal Communication.

A railway from Bridgetown to the parish of St. Andrew (24 miles as surveyed) was commenced in 1890, and completed on 10th September, 1892. The total cost of construction was £16,284.; the receipts for the year 1897 were £5,503., exclusive of Government subsidy of £6,000., and the expenses £5,952. Of the subsidy of £6,000. per annum granted by the Legislature, only a sum of £24. 17s. 6d. was paid in 1897, in consequence of the failure of the Company to comply with the provisions of Act 51 of 1896. It belonged to the Barbados Railway Company, Limited, but was on the 15th July, 1898, purchased by the Foreign American and General Trust Co., Limited, for the sum of £50,000. The whole line was reconstructed as the Bridgetown and St. Andrew Railway, Limited (24 miles). The cost of construction to 31st December, 1904, was £39,011.; the receipts for 1904 were £5,922.

In 1906 the Company was bought out by the Barbados Light Railway, Limited, and, by a special Act, a subsidy of £2,000. per annum for ten years was granted. In 1916 the Railway was bought by the Government for the sum of £20,000. The amount spent on reconstruction of the railway to the 31st March, 1921, was £50,083.

An elaborate road system exists throughout the Island, 474 miles of road being suitable for use by motor vehicles.

The Barbados Telephone Co., Limited, a private company, contains a total of 1,270 services, with a total length of line in use of about 2,448 miles. There is also a railway telephone line connecting all stations from Bridgetown to St. Andrews, about 24 miles.

Mail Service, Postage, &c.

In consequence of the European War, the contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Limited, for a regular fortnightly service has been abandoned, and the Company have, with the exception of a cargo steamer, now and again, ceased to run their steamers to Barbados. About the middle of 1919 the Company commenced to run certain small passenger steamers again, but at irregular periods.

The other steamers arriving direct from England now are the Leyland and Harrison Lines from Liverpool, and the Harrison Line from Glasgow and London at irregular periods. Length of passage between 15 and 17 days.

The Royal Dutch West India Line runs a regular fortnightly line, touching at Dover on the outward journey and at Plymouth on the return journey. Length of passage 12 days.

The Quebec Line of steamers from the United States via the West Indian Islands, and the Royal Mail Steamers from Canada, via Bermuda and the West Indian Islands, arrive fortnightly.

The cargo steamers of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine arrive frequently from Montreal direct.

There are many irregular arrivals of the Booth and Lloyd Brazileiro Lines from New York direct; and frequent but irregular arrivals of the Booth, Lloyd Brazileiro, and Lamport and Holt Lines from Brazil.

Besides these an occasional Italian Steamer from Mediterranean Ports, and many tramp steamers from South American Ports call at Barbados.

There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados, and direct cable communication with St. Vincent, and thence to the other West Indies, America, and Europe.

The Western Telegraph Company was granted permission to land their cable from Brazil in 1920, and the cable is working.

The Western Union Telegraph Company was also granted permission to land their cable, the other end of which was to be landed at Miami, Florida, but at the end of 1921 the U.S. Government had not given permission for the landing of the cable in Florida.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act No. 41 of the 9th December, 1878, which authorised a total expenditure not exceeding £15,000. annually on all grades of education. This section of the Act of 1878 was repealed, and Section 9 (d) of the Education (Amendment) Act, 1897, authorised an annual expenditure of a sum not exceeding £11,000. on elementary education. This section has now been repealed by the Education (Amendment) Act, 1910, which authorised the amount to be spent on elementary education at £14,200. In 1921 the sum of £20,336. was voted by the Legislature for Elementary Education, and the total vote for all grades of education amounted to £36,455.

The central administration is vested in a Board appointed by the Governor, and the local control of elementary schools is in the hands of the clergymen of the various districts assisted by committees of lay managers. There are 135 elementary schools with 11,299 scholars (average attendance), and 19,443 on the rolls. Secondary schools are managed by Governing Bodies working under schemes formulated by the central Board of Education and approved by the Legislature.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Sir Christopher Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of £30. per annum from the College funds, and four Island Scholarships at £40. per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are competitive, and are confined to natives or sons of natives, or of persons domiciled in the island who have resided therein for at least ten years.

There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation, which has been liberally supported by the Legislature. It has a staff of eight university
men as Masters, including a Professor of Chemistry and a Lecturer in Natural and Agricultural Sciences. The number of pupils at the close of 1920 was 209. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish, to the N.E. of the island, was re-opened in 1883, after having been closed for several years. The number of pupils at the close of 1920 was 99. There are three Barbados English Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, each of the annual value of £250, tenable at an English University, or at an Agricultural or Technical College in Europe or America, for three years.

The number of years for which these scholarships are tenable may be varied to four or five, but the total value of each scholarship cannot be more than £750.

A first grade school for girls was opened in 1883, called the Queen's College. It has a staff of seven mistresses. The number of pupils at the close of 1920 was 131.

There are five second grade schools for boys and one for girls. These schools cost the Government, including grants for scholarships, £1,114 during 1920. They also receive annual grants for scholarships from the Vestries of the various parishes in which they are situated.

Police, &c.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1835 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. The Force consists of 3 officers and 364 non-commissioned officers and men. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1867) were combined with the Land Police. A Juvenile Reformatory for boys was opened in April, 1883, and one for girls in April, 1911.

There is a lunatic asylum, a lazaretto and a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the latter of which the Colony contributed £25,850 during 1921.

Constitution.

The Colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the appointment and control of public officers, except the Treasurer, who is an officer of the House of Assembly. The Legislature consists of a Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of nine members appointed by the King, and a House of Assembly, having twenty-four members elected annually on the basis of a moderate franchise. The qualifications of members and electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, which became law in April, 1884, and which repeals all previous legislation on the subject. By this Act a liberal extension of the franchise was granted, and 2,004 electors were registered under its provisions, the number previous to its enactment being only 1,641.

This and other Acts relating to the franchise was consolidated by the Representation of the People Act, 1901. The only change made was the extension of the franchise to persons enjoying a pension of £50 a year or more. The number of registered electors for the year 1920 was 2,308.

The executive part of the Government is vested in the Executive Council appointed by the Crown and consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General ex officio, Sir F. J. Clarke, K.C.M.G., Speaker of the House of Assembly, and Hon. Sir W. K. Chandler, K.t., C.M.G., LL.D., President of the Legislative Council, and such other persons as may be nominated by the King, and the Executive Committee consisting of the members of the Executive Council ex officio, one member from the Legislative Council, and four members of the House of Assembly nominated annually by the Governor. This body introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates, and initiates all Government measures. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Tobago, but in 1885, by Royal Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands, and made a distinct Government.
