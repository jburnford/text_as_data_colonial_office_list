WEIHAIWEI.

History and Description.
The territory of Weihaiwei was leased to Great Britain by China by a Convention signed at Peking, on the 1st July, 1898.—“in order to provide Great Britain with a suitable Naval harbour in North China and for the better protection of British commerce in the neighbouring seas.”
The leased territory, which lies in latitude 37° 30' N., longitude 122° 10' E., is situated in the Chinese Province of Shantung, on the North-Eastern coast of the Shantung Peninsula. It comprises the Island of Liukung, all the islands in the Bay of Weihaiwei, and a belt of land ten English miles wide along the entire coast line.
The bay is six miles broad and from three to four wide. To it there is easy access from the Eastern and Western passages, the former being two-and-a-quarter miles wide, the latter two-thirds of a mile wide. These two channels are formed by the Island of Liukung, which, lying east and west across the Bay and being two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, forms a protection to the anchorage.
Weihaiwei is an easy place for shipping to make, and battleships and ocean steamers are able to lie close to the shore. The harbour is lighted by two lighthouses situated at the Eastern and Western entrances.
The territory has been surveyed by the Royal Engineers and mapped on a scale of two inches to a mile. The total area is 285 square miles, including the Island of Liukung.
Great Britain has also “the right to erect fortifications, station troops, or take any other measures necessary for defensive purposes at any points on or near the coast of the region East of the Meridian 121° 40' East of Greenwich, and to acquire on equitable compensation within that territory such sites as may be necessary for water supply, communications and hospitals.” Within that zone Chinese administration will not be interfered with, but no troops other than Chinese or British shall be allowed therein.” This zone has been surveyed on a scale of one inch to a mile, and its area has been fixed at 1,505 square miles. The territory has a coast line seventy-two miles in length, the shores of which are generally picturesque and in many places wild and grand. Its surface consists of abrupt ranges of rugged hills, rising to a height of 1,600 feet, and well-cultivated valleys, watered by streams which during the dry season are mere rivulets. All the hills are terraced for cultivation, so far as possible, and in many instances are planted with dwarf pine and scrub oak, but their general appearance is barren; the strata of the mountains are metamorphic, consisting of beds of quartzite, gneiss and crystalline limestone cut across by dykes of volcanic rock and granite.
There are about 320 villages, and the Chinese population (according to the census of 1921) is 154,416.
The chief port of the territory is named Port Edward, in commemoration of the coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII.
Arrangements are under consideration for the retrocession of the territory to China in accordance with the decisions taken at the recent conference at Washington, and it is expected that this will take place before the end of 1923.

Climate.
The climate is regarded as one of the best in China. The winter is cold and bracing, and the
summer heat is not excessive. The maximum temperature in the shade is about 92° F., and the minimum about 10°. The rainfall is very small, averaging about 24 inches a year.

**Constitution and Government.**

The Government is administered by a Commissioner, appointed under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, who discharges his functions under the Weihaiwei Order in Council of the 24th July, 1901. Under that instrument the Commissioner is empowered to make Ordinances, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the administration of the territory, and provision is made for a High Court, in which all jurisdiction, civil and criminal, is vested, subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, and for District Magistrates' Courts.

The village communities are administered through their headmen in accordance with Chinese custom.

During the summer months Weihaiwei is used by His Majesty's fleet on the China Station as a sanatorium and exercising ground, and is frequented by visitors who are attracted by its climate.

The territory previous to 1921-22 has been assisted by a grant-in-aid from Imperial funds.

The revenue for 1922-23 was estimated at $172,918, and the expenditure at $238,063.

Excess of assets over liabilities on 31st March, 1922, was $80,590, and no grant-in-aid has been necessary for 1922-23.

In previous years the statistics were:

| Year    | Revenue | Expenditure | Grant-in-Aid |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1912-13 | $79,582 | $146,147    | $6,000       |
| 1913-14 | $93,780 | $166,960    | $8,300       |
| 1914-15 | $109,687| $148,185    | $5,000       |
| 1915-16 | $115,662| $166,697    | $3,500       |
| 1916-17 | $126,909| $139,299    |              |
| 1917-18 | $142,877| $175,652    | $650         |
| 1918-19 | $150,723| $184,600    | $4,000       |
| 1919-20 | $161,727| $206,432    | $7,900       |
| 1920-21 | $164,973| $235,446    | $20,000      |
| 1921-22 | $199,002| $226,702    | $8,000       |

The administration of Weihaiwei was first undertaken by the Senior Naval Officer on the station in 1898. In the following year it was transferred to a Military and Civil Commissioner appointed by the War Office. On the 1st January, 1901, the territory was handed over to the control of the Colonial Office, and a Civil Commissioner assumed the administration of the Government in 1902.

**WESTERN PACIFIC.**

**High Commission.**

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, New South Wales, or New Zealand, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1907, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Phoenix Group.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.

The following groups and islands which were formerly under British protection were formed into a Colony, at the request of the natives, by His Majesty's Orders in Council of 10th November, 1915 and 27th January and 29th February, 1916.

OCEAN ISLAND, or PAANOPE, in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, was included in the jurisdiction of the Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Protectorate in 1900. It is the Head-quarters of the Government and the site of operations by the British Phosphate Commission, whose European employees there number about 80. The natives of the island, who are closely allied to the Gilbertese, are decreasing in numbers owing to European conditions. Labour for the phosphate operations is procured from the Gilbert Group, and from Japan and China.

A Wireless Station was erected at Ocean Island in 1916. The total population of the Colony is approximately 29,000 including about 200 Europeans and 800 Asiatics.

THE GILBERT AND ELICE GROUPS contain 16 inhabited islands in the former and eight in the latter group. They consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 4° N. latitude and 10° S. and 170° to 180° E. longitude. Area, 180 sq. miles. The principal export is copra which is steadily increasing.

The natives, who number about 28,000, are of Malay-Polynesian race, the majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government presided over by a native magistrate. A revised code of native laws is validated by an ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials. Revenue is obtained from a land, or copra tax, trading licences, import duties, non native capitalation tax, etc., which covers the cost of maintaining a regular government. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups.

THE UNION GROUP consists of three coral atolls about 9° S. latitude and 170° W. longitude. The natives are of the Polynesian race and number about 1,000. The language is closely allied to that of the Ellice Group. Nearly all the natives are adherents of the London Missionary Society or of the Roman Catholic Samoan Mission. Copra is the only export. Native governments have been established as in the Gilbert and Ellice Groups. A European official supervises the Ellice and Union Groups, but communication between the two groups is limited to about three calls a year.

FANNING and WASHINGTON ISLANDS lie about 3° 51' N. latitude and 159° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but the Fanning Island Company employ about 400 Gilbert natives in the copra industry. A resident European official has lately been placed in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner for the Colony. The Pacific Cable Board has its Mid Ocean Station on Fanning Island. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel of the Fanning Island Company.

CHRISTMAS ISLAND (1° 57' N., 157° 27' W.) is the largest atoll in the Pacific. It has been planted with coconuts, but is usually uninhabited.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work has been undertaken of late years and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. Every Island has a native hospital under the charge of a native student trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

The Revenue and Expenditure of the Colony have been as follows:

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ontong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. The native population has been estimated, approximately, at 150,000, but is decreasing. Large numbers were carried off by dysentery during the eighteen months ended March 31st, 1915. Malaita is the most densely populated, but dysentery and fighting among its inhabitants has greatly reduced the numbers. The natives have been described as treacherous; some tribes are still head-hunters and cannibals. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped by legislation. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philip and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts in March, 1914, amounted to 30,000 acres. The non-native population in 1914 numbered 660 Europeans, in 1919 numbered 675 Europeans and 75 Asiatics, in 1922, 498 Europeans and 90 Foreigners. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893. The headquarters of the Protectorate is at Tulagi, a small island off Florida. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, Mala, Gizo, San Cristoval, Guadalcanal and Ysabel. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

TONGA.

Area 250 sq. miles.

Census of Population, April, 1921:

| Category     | Number |
|--------------|--------|
| Europeans    | 571    |
| Half-castes  | 235    |
| Tongans      | 22,680 |
| Others       | 247    |
| **Total**    | **23,733** |

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, are situated between the 20th and 23rd degrees of south latitude. The islands are most of them of coral formation, but include some active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafoou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. Bananas and oranges are also exported from Vavau, in the northern part of the group. There is regular steam communication with Auckland via Fiji (1,000 miles distant), Sydney (1,850 miles), and Fiji, and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles).

The late king George Tubou I was the first of its chiefs or kings to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga. The king is assisted by a native parliament and a privy council. With the exception of a few Europeans in the Treasury, Education, and Medical Departments, the whole of the Government officers are Tongans. The tariff resembles that of Fiji, and licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades. The revenue in 1917-18 amounted to 58,340l., and the expenditure to 35,865l.; in 1918-19 the revenue amounted to 66,900l., and the expenditure to 43,688l.; in 1919-20 the revenue amounted to 79,927l., and the expenditure to 55,533l.; and in 1920-21, revenue, 74,165l., expenditure, 90,884l. According to the official returns the imports and exports were:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1912 | 169,472 | 216,511 |
| 1913 | 81,044  | 82,320  |
| 1914 | 87,702  | 73,036  |
| 1915 | 100,075 | 103,961 |
| 1916 | 48,428  | 32,520  |
| 1917 | 114,290 | 126,442 |
| 1918 | 177,151 | 169,757 |
| 1919 | 193,169 | 443,195 |
| 1920 | 383,759 | 372,278 |

The shipping in 1914 amounted to—Entered, 57,474 tons; cleared, 54,099 tons. The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are five churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years), with at present about 3,000 adherents only; the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents; the "Free Church of England," the number of whose adherents is unknown; and the Church of England. The Free Church of Tonga was established in 1885, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakaogo," i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier, an ex-Wesleyan missionary. Six persons charged with complicity in the attempt were shot. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakagogs," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakaogo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days...
before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuafo). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufaahau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917, to Prince Viliami Tugi, Governor of Vavau and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection, whereupon a protectorate was proclaimed.

In December, 1904, and January, 1906, the High Commissioner, Sir Everard im Thurn, spent some time in Tonga, re-organising the system of administration—which had by that time fallen into some disorder, and receiving an undertaking from the king of more strict compliance with the liabilities assumed by him under the Treaty of 1890. The Premier, Jiosateki Toga Veikune, and the Treasurer were removed to Fiji, under an Order in Council; and Jione Mateialoa was appointed to the Premiership, which office he held until 30th September, 1912, when he resigned. Since that date the appointment has been held by Devita Bolutele Kaho, Tui Vakano. The progress of Tonga, since 1905 has been satisfactory.

All the natives are taught to read and write, and higher education is provided by colleges established by the Government and by the Wesleyan Mission.

British and foreign subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine and local police, not recognised as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The population has been estimated at from 100,000 to 140,000, but the Mission returns place it at only 50,000. Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church. There is a European population of about 900, mostly British and French. The principal exports are copra, maize, and coffee; timber, cotton and sulphur are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent.

At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914 to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 18th, 1922. It is anticipated that it will be proclaimed in the New Hebrides early in 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers have been appointed.

The Phoenix group comprises Phoenix, Birnie, Hull, Canton, Gardner, McKean, Enderbury, Sydney, Baker and Howland Islands, and is situated to the east of the Gilbert and Ellice groups. The Islands are of coral formation, and several of them are planted with coconuts. All except McKean and Enderbury Islands are leased to the Samoa Shipping and Trading Company for 87 years, from 1st January, 1914.

* In the service of the Condominium Government.
PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Tahiti. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population in 1914 was 140 (36 adult males, 39 adult females, 66 children).

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, Parkin Christian.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.

NAURU.

Nauru (0° 26' S., 166° 56' E.), or Pleasant Island, an uplifted atoll, was discovered by Captain Fearn in 1798, and was annexed by Germany in 1888. It has an area of about eight square miles, and a native population of 1,400. A number of Chinese are employed in working the great deposits of phosphate-rock, which, under an Agreement dated 2nd July, 1919, will be exploited jointly by the Imperial Government and the Governments of Australia and New Zealand. Coconuts are extensively cultivated. A wireless station is in operation.

Nauru was surrendered to H.M.A.S. "Melbourne" in November, 1914, and, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, was administered under the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific until June 10th, 1921. A mandate conferred by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers on the British Empire to administer Nauru was approved by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920. In accordance with the agreement set forth in the Nauru Island Agreement Act, 1920, the administration is at present entrusted to an administrator appointed by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. Administrator, Brigadier-General Griffiths.
