ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is the largest coralline island on the African coast, being 48 miles long by 15 broad, and having an area of 640 square miles. To the north east at a distance of some thirty miles lies the island of Pemba in 6° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 40 miles long by 10 broad, and having an area of 380 square miles.

Climate.

The annual rainfall amounts approximately in Zanzibar to 58 inches and in Pemba to 83 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined: the heavy rains occur in April previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The thermometer ranges from 77° to 90° with a minimum of 80°. The climatic conditions though trying in the hot season which lasts from November to March are not necessarily unfavourable to Europeans provided that periods of residence are limited to terms of from twenty to thirty months.

People.

The Arabs were the conquerors and are the principal landowners of the islands. The conditions of life in a malarious and tropical country have deprived them of much of the vigorous temperament which distinguished their ancestors and the stoppage of the supply of slaves has left many of them almost without any resources. Nevertheless, though shaken by the ordeal through which they have passed, they still possess most of the land, and carry on the clove growing industry for which the two islands are famous. They understand the natives, and the natives understand them and accept their control more readily than that of any other race, except Europeans.

The bulk of the Zanzibar population consists of representatives of all the tribes of East Africa, intermingled with an Asiatic element. The name given to this mixed population is Swahili, a term formerly used to note the coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, “ashil” in Arabic meaning coast.

The descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern portion of the island and especially on the east coast. They are the principal cattle breeders of the island. An Mhadimu is literally a servant, a term bestowed by the northern tribes when they conquered the country.

The natives of Pemba are known as Wapemba; they do not live in such seclusion as the Wahadimu on the larger island, but intermingle more freely with the Arabs and Swahili.

Khojas, Bohoras, Hindoos, Parsees, Goanese possess most of the trade of Zanzibar either as merchants, shopkeepers, money-lenders, small traders or skilled mechanics. Goanese keep the European stores and provide both cooks and dhobis. They and the Parsees are also employed largely as clerks.

There is a considerable contingent of natives of Tanganyika Territory and of the Comoro islands who have settled in Zanzibar and with the north-east monsoon arrive numbers of Somalis, Shihiri Arabs and Baluchis in dhows laden with the
products of their countries. These people usually return with the south-west monsoon, but a few remain and settle permanently.

History.

The early history of Zanzibar is chiefly a record of petty feuds and complicated quarrels. The so-called "Zenj Empire" was already declining when the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral towards the close of the fifteenth century. It was during the sixteenth century that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa Fort in 1598 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Tawain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by making the island his permanent residence and by encouraging the cultivation of cloves. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "all Africa as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000£. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000£.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the Imperial Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized the Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

Industries and Trade.

The clove industry is by far the most important in the Protectorate, the Islands of Zanzibar and Pemba yielding the bulk of the world's supply. The clove was first introduced into Zanzibar from Réunion in 1818, and Sir Richard Burton remarks that as early as 1835 it had "almost supplanted the vulgar valuable coconut and the homely rice necessary for local consumption." He advised the Arabs of Zanzibar to follow the example of Mauritius and to give up cloves in favour of sugar. Colonel Rigby wrote in 1860:—"Were the prosperity of the Zanzibar Dominions dependent upon these degenerated Arabs it might well be despised of," and complained of their lack of initiative in refusing to cultivate anything else. In spite of advice, however, and notwithstanding disasters—the hurricane of 1872, which devastated the main island, cutting off every clove and coconut tree, and the smallpox epidemic of 1883, which decimated the population—the Arabs clung to their cloves, and, by thus concentrating on one product, "surpassing all plants in value," to quote Lord Acton, have given Zanzibar a position on the world's market which she would probably never have attained had her energies been dissipated over a large variety. It is estimated that there are in both Islands about 60,000 acres under cloves and about 5½ million trees in bearing. The output varies considerably, the trees yielding heavy crops every three to five years: the average output of recent years has been about 14 million lbs. The large plantations are chiefly owned by Arabs, but many natives possess small holdings.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both Islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 45,000 acres under cultivation and 2½ million trees in both Islands. The export of copra, which is steadily increasing, amounted to 12,982 tons in 1921. Much is produced by the small grower or trader, neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Cochin and Ceylon.

The principal export besides cloves and copra is chillies; re-exports, gum copal, hides and skins, ivory and rubber.

The chief imports are piece-goods, rice, various grains and petroleum.

Currency and Banking.

The silver rupee of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, is the standard coin of Zanzibar. All other silver coins of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. These coins are ½, ¼, and ⅛ of a rupee. British India 1 rupee notes are also legal tender to any amount. Seyyidieh copper piee are legal tender at the rate of 64 piee to 1 rupee for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. There is a Government note issue of the denominations Rupees 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500.

The National Bank of India, Ltd., and the Standard Bank of South Africa have branches in Zanzibar.

Shipping and Communications.

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland.
Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of trans-shipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast. Recent figures, nevertheless, tend to indicate that the Island will continue, by reason of its geographical position, to retain control of the local traffic.

The British India Steam Navigation Company and the Union Castle Steamship Company maintain monthly services between London—Zanzibar—Durban and Southampton—Zanzibar—Durban respectively, the Clan-Ellerlan-Harrison Line between Glasgow—Liverpool—Zanzibar—Beira (cargo only), and the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes between Marseilles—Zanzibar—Madagascar. The British India Steam Navigation Company also maintain a service twice a month between Bombay—Zanzibar—Durban, and there are local services between Zanzibar—Mombasa—Aden and the Benadir Coast. The Government possesses two steamers which maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba.

The steamers of the Societa Maritima Italiana call three times weekly between Genoa and Durban and back to Genoa.

The steamers of the Holland Africa Line call about once in 21 days between Amsterdam and back to Amsterdam via Durban.

Portuguese Government steamers call at irregular intervals from Lisbon via the West Coast, and back to Lisbon via the Suez Canal.

There is cable communication with Europe either via Aden or via Durban.

There are 75 miles of roads throughout the Island of Zanzibar suitable for motor traffic. The Government maintains wireless stations in Zanzibar and Pemba and a telephone system in the town of Zanzibar which is connected with the District and Agricultural Stations in the country. A light railway runs north from the town to Bububu, 7 miles distant.

There are 7 post offices in the two Islands.

APPENDIX TO PART II.

This Appendix gives some account of Iraq (Mesopotamia), North Borneo, Palestine, Sarawak and certain miscellaneous British Possessions and Protectorates which are not included in the main portion of the Historical and Statistical Account above.

IRAQ (MESOPOTAMIA).

Iraq, in the sense in which the name is used now, is that part of the former Ottoman Empire which stretches from Fao on the Persian Gulf to a point north of Mosul and just south of Jazirah-Bin-Umar, on the Tigris. It comprises the vilayets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul, with the exception of Amadiyah which, by the Treaty of Sévres, is left to Turkey.

The area of Iraq is about 116,511 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the new Turkish frontier, which approximates to latitude 37° N. and follows the northern boundary of the vilayet of Mosul. On the east, it is bounded by Persia. The frontier, the delimitation of which was completed by a Turko-Persian Commission in 1914, runs in the north through, and in the southern portion skirts, the Kurdish mountains which form the western edge of the Persian plateau, and descends 10 miles above Mohammaher to the Shatt-al-Arab, the river formed by the union of the Euphrates and the Tigris. On the south, Iraq is bounded by the Persian Gulf and Kuwait; and on the south-west and west by the deserts of northern Arabia and Syria. On the the north-west, the boundary between Iraq and Syria was settled by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920. It runs from the Tigris at Feiskhabur to Albu Kemal on the Euphrates, and thence across the desert to Imtar, south of Jebel Druz. Apart from the hill country in the north-east, Iraq mainly consists of great plains traversed by the Euphrates and the Tigris. The country between these rivers is divided into two parts. The southern portion, stretching from Baghdad to Basrah is a great alluvial plain about 35,000 square miles in area, with a fertile soil wherever the land can be irrigated without being drowned. A considerable extent of it is, however, covered by marshes formed by the uncontrolled action of the rivers and canals. The northern portion known as Jazirah or "the Island," is more undulating, and is in places broken by ranges of hills. It is fertile under irrigation in the north, but further south the plains become more arid until it passes into a hard desert tract.

The climate of Iraq is of the continental sub-tropical type, with very high temperatures in summer in the plains. In July and August the mean daily maximum temperature is 104° F. at Basrah, and 110° F. at Baghdad, while in December and January the mean daily minimum temperature is 47° F. at Basra and 40° F. at Baghdad. The rainy season is from November to March. There is a rainless summer of six months lasting from about April to September. The Mosul area has a rainfall of about 13 inches a year and relies on the rain to grow its crops. The rest of the country, however, has an annual rainfall of only about seven inches, and the crops are grown, with very little help from the rain, on irrigated land.

The chief towns are Baghdad, Basrah, Mosul, Kerbela, and Nejef. The two last, situated on the edge of the Arabian desert, are pilgrim centres which attract Shiites from all parts of the Mohammedan world, but especially from Persia and India.

Population.

According to a census taken in 1920 the population numbers 2,849,282, made up as follows:

| Sunnis | Shi'ahs | Jewish | Christians | Other Religions | Total |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Basrah Vilayet | 42,558 | 721,414 | 10,088 | 2,551 | 8,989 | 785,600 |
| Baghdad Vilayet | 524,414 | 750,421 | 62,565 | 20,771 | 2,133 | 1,360,304 |
| Mosul Vilayet | 579,713 | 22,180 | 14,835 | 55,470 | 31,180 | 703,378 |
| Total | 1,146,685 | 1,494,015 | 87,488 | 78,792 | 42,302 | 2,849,282 |

* The figures for Mosul include the population of the Kurdish area of Sulaimaniyah, viz., 165,000, of whom all but 1,100 are Sunnis.

Natural Products.

The chief articles of export from Iraq before the war were dates, wool and barley. Dates and wool have continued to be exported, but the export of barley has fallen almost to nothing, mainly because of the purchases made by the British military authorities in Iraq. Round Mosul the prevailing crop is wheat, but all the wheat grown is consumed in the country. Rice, in most cases "red" rice of inferior quality, is grown on the swampy lands on the Middle Euphrates, in the Amarah area on the Tigris, and to a small extent, on the Diyala canals, near Baghdad. Rice of better quality but in very small quantities is grown in the Kurdish hills.

In the Kurdish regions round Sulaimaniyah and Rowanduz and to the north of Mosul tobacco is an important crop. The crop is hardly sufficient for local requirements. None is exported.

In the Baghdad Vilayet cotton can be grown. Experiments carried out since the occupation of Baghdad in 1917 tend to show that Iraqi cotton compares favourably with cotton grown in other parts of the world.
Wool is exported in considerable quantities. The principal sheep rearing districts are the Mosul area and the Kurdish hills.

There are traces of petroleum in many places round Mosul and Kirkuk and near the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanaqin.

Minor products are millet, licorice root, gall-nuts, gum and dye-roots.

Railways.

The railways open to traffic are—

Metre Gauge.

1. From Basrah to Baghdad with branch to Hindiyah Barrage.
2. From Baghdad to Quraitu on the Persian frontier with a branch line to Kifri.

In all, 669 miles of open line and 884 miles track mileage.

Standard Gauge (4ft. 8½in.).

3. From Baghdad to Shargat 187 miles of open line and 213 miles track mileage.

With the exception of about 75 miles of the Baghdad-Shargat line, which was built by the Baghdad Railway Company before the war, the whole of this railway system has been made by the British authorities during and since the war.

There is a gap of 70 miles between the Mesopotamian railroad at Shargat and Mosul; and the Baghdad Railway comes down to Nisibin, about 110 miles from Mosul. Thus railway communication between Constantinople and Basrah, via Aleppo, Mosul and Baghdad is complete except for a gap of less than 200 miles.

Government.

The war left Iraq in British occupation; and by the Treaty of Sèvres (10th August, 1920), Turkey renounced all sovereignty over the country. On March 2nd, 1921, the supervision of the affairs of Iraq was transferred to the Colonial Office.

In Turkish times each of the three Vilayets was governed by a Vali, who received orders directly from Constantinople. The official hierarchy, in descending order of importance, was:

Vali ... in charge of Vilayet.
Mutasarrif ... , Liwa.
Qaimmaqam ... , Qadha.
Mudir ... , Nahiyah.

As Iraq came under British control, as a result of the military operations of 1914-1918, British Political Officers took over the administration of liwas and qadhases, working under the orders of the Chief Political Officer (later the Civil Commissioner). This system was modified when Sir Percy Cox was appointed High Commissioner. When he took up his post in the autumn of 1920, he organised a provisional native Government composed of a Council of Arab Ministers which was presided over by the Naqib of Baghdad. On August 23rd, 1921, the Sharif Faisal, third son of the King of the Hejaz was proclaimed King of Iraq, by virtue of a referendum to the people, which resulted in his election by 96½%. The government of the country is thus vested in an Iraq Government, the King being advised by the British High Commissioner, while each Ministry has a British Adviser attached to it. Every Liwa is administered by a native Muta-arif, who is assisted by a British Inspector.

On October 11th, 1922, the High Commissioner and the Naqib signed a treaty (not yet ratified) to regulate the relations between His Majesty's Government and the Government of Iraq. The Naqib resigned office in November, and a new cabinet, mainly composed of ministers who had previously served under him was formed under the Presidency of 'Abdul Muhsin Beg Sa'dun.

NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitang River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with
an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. The headquarters of administration are at Jesselton. Other stations are at Labuk, Kotabelud, Tuaran, Tambunan, Kaningau, Tenom, Beaufort, Pensangan, Lamag, Papar, Putatan, Ranau, Timbang Batu, Semporna Mempakul, Sipitang and Rundum.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, coconuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The country is mountainous. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who according to the Census taken in 1921 number about 267,804, are mainly Bruneis, Ibanuns, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade; further back, the Dusuns cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields; and in the interior they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt, clearing fresh jungle every year; the Muruts, another interior tribe, are very numerous and peaceable, occasionally varying more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting raids on a petty scale. There are Chinese settlements on the coast; they cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. There are 415 Europeans and 37,000 Chinese in the territory. Sandakan, the chief town, with suburbs, has a population of 12,000. There are several missions, including the Church of England, with stations at Kudat and Jesselton and Beaufort, and the Roman Catholic, with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast. The former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton. The Basel Mission also has schools at Kudat, Beaufort and Papar, and at Sandakan and Tenom. A few Government vernacular schools have recently been opened.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive concessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (now Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 120 inches, according to situation.

Industry.

The principal products of the country are estate rubber, timber, tobacco, coal, copra and cutch. The last decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of the rubber industry. The value of rubber exported in 1917 was 635,284l., in 1918, 670,767l., in 1919, 782,037l., in 1920, 689,403l., and in 1921, 289,634l. The vast timber resources of the country form one of its principal assets, but until recently only the fringe of the forests was being worked. A Company was however formed in 1920 for more adequate timber exploitation with modern lumbering apparatus. Timber is being exported in increasing quantities to China, Australia and England. At Sandakan two large sawmills have been working for some years, and a modern band sawmill has been recently installed. Tobacco was formerly the principal article of export. Exports of tobacco were valued at 176,618l. in 1917, 49,499l. in 1918, 230,122l. in 1919, 200,376l. in 1920, and 149,901l. in 1921. The number of coconut plantations has rapidly increased, and exports of copra have risen considerably in value. Cutch, a tanning material obtained from the bark of certain trees, is manufactured at Sandakan. Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper and tea. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay.

The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rotan, firewood, salt fish, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, cutch, etc., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself directly engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, stamps, and royalties, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites.

Development.

Sandakan on the East and Jesselton on the West are the principal ports. Both towns have developed rapidly, and are now supplied with
electric light and cold storage. Considerable sums have been spent by Government on reclamation, improvement of water supplies, etc., at both ports.

Minerals.

Excellent coal is being worked by the Cowie Harbour Coal Company, and coal is being supplied to vessels at the principal North Borneo ports. Sandakan is also rapidly becoming of importance as a coaling station for ocean liners. Gold in alluvial form is found in certain of the rivers on the East Coast.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. Indications of the presence of petroleum occur in many parts of the State and prospecting work is being carried out by concessionary companies.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent, and 5 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars. A State Bank of North Borneo has been established with head office at Sandakan, and a branch office at Jesselton. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Chinese Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Taiwan. A State Bank is in process of formation.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are five Residencies, viz., the Sandakan, West Coast, East Coast, Kudat and Interior Residencies.

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British Colonies, and an Imam's court, for the administration of Mohamedan law, with native courts for trials by local customs. There is a force of about 750 armed police under European officers.

Means of Communication.

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers every 10 days between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan, and a local company runs a line along the coast and to adjacent islands. The Government have constructed a metre-gauge railway from Brunei Bay to Beaufort, 20 miles, and from Beaufort to Jesselton, 57 miles, and a line of 33 miles from Beaufort to Tenom, which will open up the interior. In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 120 miles. The principal coastal terminus is Jesselton, at which port there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. Over 600 miles of telegraph line are open, and wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau. Several riding roads already exist, and over 400 miles of bridle path have been constructed. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about twenty-six days. Postage to all British possessions for letters 6 cents per oz.; foreign countries, 12 cents for the first oz., 6 cents each succeeding oz.

On the completion of the Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau-Sebatik. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Lamag and Lahad Datu from Sandakan, and Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan and Kudat.
