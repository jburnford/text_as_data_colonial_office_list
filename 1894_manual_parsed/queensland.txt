QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point of the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the Colony.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the Colony of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,838,080 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was however not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from Nov. to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good sized vessels. A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the 21st parallel of south latitude, and thence west to the western boundary. Another range branches from the main range about lat. 21° south and long. 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the
country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Sugar growing has now become a very important industry. In 1892 there were 55,520 acres under cane, of which 40,572 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 61,368 tons of sugar.

Maize was grown on 92,172 acres, and returned a yield of 2,353,558 bushels.

In 1892 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 222 acres, which yielded 576,738 lbs.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba, Warwick, and Roma, on the Darling Downs. In 1892, 33,332 acres were planted with this cereal, principally in the localities mentioned. Out of the total area planted 1,428 acres were mown for hay, and 31,742 acres yielded 462,583 bushels of grain. 167 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the Colony, and there are 4,222 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 483,279 sq. miles, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

The chief exports are wool, 105,228,383 lbs., valued at 4,262,471l.; gold, 2,072,870l.; sugar, 589,753l.; live stock, 621,548l.; tin, 155,204l.; silver, 86,770l.; meat, 875,974l.; and hides and skins, 252,330l. The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware, and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, China, and the United States.

The Gympie and Charters Towers gold fields still maintain large mining populations, and the yield from their reefs, although satisfactory, is not so favourable as would be the case if more scientific appliances were available for the extraction of the metal. During the year 1884 an important discovery of gold was made near Rockhampton, at a place called Mount Morgan. The find is undoubtedly a very rich one; but, being on private and not on Crown land, it is difficult to obtain reliable information as to the actual yield. The geological character of this gold field is peculiar, the gold being found in a frothy porous sinter, so light that it floats in the water like pumice, and the fine gold is disseminated throughout the sinter, which is supposed to have been deposited by a thermal spring. Another important discovery was made during the year 1880 in tin mining at Herberton, in the Cardwell district. The returns are very good, and already a large and apparently permanent township has sprung up in the locality. There are lead mines in operation at Ravenswood, the ore from which yields a good percentage of silver. There are also large deposits of gold in the district. Cinnabar, antimony, and manganese are also among the mineral products. Another important gold field was afterwards discovered in the Gulf watershed, and the large mining township of Croydon has sprung up.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hardwood, which is most in demand: flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood,* &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the Eucalyptus is coming largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Excellent coal has already been found in some localities, and new discoveries are being frequently made. There were 265,086 tons of this mineral raised during 1892, valued at 123,308l. At Burrum, in the Maryborough district, splendid coal has been discovered, and a railway constructed to the spot, in order to bring the mineral to the Port of Maryborough.

Brisbane, Maryboro, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1892, 209 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 31,805.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51·20 per cent. in 5 years, and the census of 5th April, 1891, shows the population to be about 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,939 females; Chinese about 8,574, Polynesians about 9,428, and other Asiatic races about 1,882. The balance of the population are mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are believed to be about 30,000 in the Colony.

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 86 are under Municipal Government, and contain a population of about 171,026. The receipts of the local authorities in 1892 were 606,615l.; their expenditure 602,423l.; the assessed capital value of the property in the districts under their control 45,089,547l., and debt 1,615,443l. Debts for water works, amounting to 765,110l., which are due principally from these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, is beautifully situated on the finer river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs

* Beech and yellow wood are hard wood timbers.
has a population, according to census, 1891 (five mile radius), 93,657; (ten mile radius), 102,167., It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast, and the climate during the greater part of the year is healthy and enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (9,564), Ipswich (7,625), Maryborough (8,700), Rockhampton (11,787), Gympie (8,449), and Toowoomba (7,007).

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1892, 11 banks, with 188 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as 2,082,364l.; deposits, 10,498,904l.; note circulation, 575,435l. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 47,093; the amount of deposits as 1,708,393l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

At the end of 1892* the railways in Queensland showed 2,358 miles in operation, the cost of construction being 16,746,195l., the revenue being 1,041,222l., and the working expenses 632,321l. There were 53 miles of railway authorised or in course of construction. The following lines are now open for traffic:— The Southern and Western from Brisbane to Charleville; with its branches, Ipswich to Dugandan, Ipswich to Esk, Toowoomba via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Toowoomba to Crows Nest, Toowoomba to Pittsworth, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to Nerang, with branches to Southport and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Bundaberg, with branches to Sandgate, to Kilkivan, and to Isis. From Bundaberg a line is open to Mount Perry, a great copper mining centre.

The Central Railway is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches to Springsure and Clermont; also one to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 28 miles of railway are open to Mirani, with a branch to Eton opening up good agricultural land.

The Northern Railway is open from Townsville to Hughenden, with a branch to Ravenswood, having been carried past Charters Towers, the latter town a great gold mining centre, having a population of about 10,000 inhabitants. From all the above railways several fresh branches are being constructed tending to open up the Colony. The trunk lines all start from the head of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook and Carpentaria Division a railway is being constructed to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 67 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also in course of construction from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Herberton, the great tin mining centre, a considerable portion of which is now open for traffic. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, south-easterly.

There are 354 electric telegraph stations in the Colony. The number of miles of line 9,996, with 17,646 miles of wire. The receipts were 82,952l., and expenditure 112,991l.; but the value of work performed for the public service, for which the department received no remuneration, was 34,764l.

The number of messages despatched during 1892 was 1,104,311. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 705 subscribers who use it, and aerial cables containing multiple wires are now being used to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks, with supplementary steamers occasionally; via Brindisi and Melbourne every fortnight; via San Francisco and Sydney every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi and Torres Straits is forty-nine days. Tenders are now being called for a new and faster service by this route. There is daily communication with Sydney and Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia and with Singapore. The rates of postage are:

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vic. No. 1. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school boards assist the department with advice and supervision. There are 657 schools, containing 78,889 children on the roll. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 145 private schools, with 10,078 children on the roll on Dec., 1892. There are no local rates for education, which is paid for by the whole Colony.

* On 30th June, 1892, the length open was 2,320 miles, and the capital expenditure thereon 16,700,981l.
Defence.

The land defence force of the Colony, including the staff, consists of 158 officers and 2,927 non-commissioned officers and men; the volunteer force of 35 officers and 742 non-commissioned officers and men. There is also a force of cadets numbering 19 officers and 558 non-commissioned officers and privates; also unattached officers and medical staff numbering 78.

Marine defence is provided for by 2 gunboats, a torpedo boat, a picket boat, and by six naval brigades and one artillery corps.

Batteries have been erected at Lytton, guarding the entrance of the Brisbane River, and one also at Townsville.

Immigration.

The European immigration for the year 1891 was 2,815. The arrivals from Hong Kong numbered 803, and of Polynesians from the South Sea Islands, 1,050.

The land order system of immigration has to a certain extent been revived, inasmuch as persons who now pay their full passage to the colony, and are approved by the Agent-General as suitable colonists, are each granted a land order of the nominal value of twenty pounds. These land orders are issued under the provisions of the Crown Lands Act of 1886, and are available for ten years from date of issue for the payment of the first or any subsequent year's rent of any agricultural or grazing farm taken up under Part IV of the Act. A very extensive system of immigration direct from England was established by means of the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels in the latter part of the year 1881. These ships coming through the Suez Canal and via Torres Straits, enable the Government to distribute the immigrants carried by them at various ports on the eastern seaboard, where they are likely to obtain employment or wish to settle themselves.

By Act 47 Vic., No. 18 of 1884, a poll tax of 30l. is levied upon every Chinese arriving in the Colony, and by Act 53 Vic., No. 2, the number to be landed by any one ship is limited.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vic., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. Every man of 21 years, who has resided six months in one locality, having a vote. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 37 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act No. 10 of 1887, the Colony is divided into 61 districts, of which 11 return two members, and 50 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.
