NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.

The Colony of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 153rd meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the Colony of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the Colony follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three Colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the Colony is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the Colony follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary, the Dumaresq; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dumaresq. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence, almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area comprised within these limits is estimated at 310,700 square miles, or 198,848,000 acres, being a little over two and a-half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area would be 195,832,150 acres, or about 306,066 square miles.

The length of the Colony, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 680 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 760 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 850 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' S. lat., and 151° 12' E. long.

Of the total area of the Colony, 46,295,954 acres have been alienated, or are in process of alienation.

History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, and gave it the name of New South Wales, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, when the convict station (intended for Botany Bay) was established at Port Jackson under Captain Phillips, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The population in 1810 was 9,000. The Merino sheep was introduced in this year. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. Moreton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 37,000. Convicts ceased to arrive in 1841. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1855. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean is 45°-8, to Clarence Heads 69°-6. On the coast it varies from 59°-2 at Cape St. George to 69°-6 at Clarence Heads. Sydney being 62°-8, almost the same as Barcelona. On the mountains snow lies in some places all the winter. On the high table land at Bathurst the mean temperature is 56°-3, and on the inland plains about 70°-0.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases; at Wilcannia it is 13-6 inches; at Sydney, 55 inches; and the days on which rain fell in 1891, 200. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while Sydney in 148 days has 49-80 inches. Fifty years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry, cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The export of wool the produce of the Colony during the past ten years has been as follows:—

The coal mines have steadily advanced since 1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is given as 433,889 tons, valued at 236,230l., while in 1881, 1,776,224 tons, valued at 603,248l., were raised from 40 mines; and in 1892, 8,780,968 tons, valued at 1,462,386l., raised from 101 mines.

Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry, 106 vessels, of a total tonnage of 9,130, were registered during the year 1892.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at which gold was received for coinage during 1892 to the extent of 2,780,829l.

| Total                    | £34,564,192 |

* Now in liquidation.

The total note circulation at the same date was 1,439,872l.

During the financial crisis of 1893 the following banks suspended payment, pending reconstruction:—

English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered. Re-opened 9th August, 1893.

Confidence being fully restored, financial and commercial operations have rapidly recovered from the great effects of the depression, and little remains to indicate the crisis which has been passed.

The New South Wales Savings Bank, established 1832, had, at the close of 1892, 66,058 depositors, with 3,351,995l. deposited. Interest is allowed at the rate of 5l. per cent. per annum on deposits up to 200l. on accounts remaining open at end of year, on accounts closed during the year the rate is 4 per cent. per annum. The Government (Post Office) Savings Banks, established in 1871, had, on 31st December, 1892, 2,354,086l. deposited by 101,668 depositors. Interest is allowed at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on deposits up to 200l.

Means of Communication.

There are more than 35,758 miles of Government roads, 6,211 of which are metalled and gravelled or ballasted. In addition to 25,854 culverts (under 15 feet span), = 403,253 feet, 3,550 bridges (over 15 feet) = 243,697 feet, there are 108 public ferries, 7 being worked by steam. In addition there are 182 boat ferries. There are 2,351 miles of railways, all owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been 33,456,496l. The receipts during the year ended 30th June, 1893, were 3,222,423l., and the working expenses 1,250,099l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being 1,922,324l. There are also 801 miles of private railway, which cost 438,841l. to construct. There are 49 miles of Government tramways, earning 305,090l., against working expenses amounting to 248,591l. The total capital expenditure on tramways, 1,118,471l.

Of telegraphs there are 11,905 miles open, with 26,448 miles of wire, with 706 stations. The cost of construction was 801,918l., and the net revenue received during 1892, 185,014l.

The following are the numbers of telegrams transmitted and received in New South Wales:—

Nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, and the Hunter, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the fortnightly vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Port Said), the Orient lines (via Colombo and Naples), and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Mauritius and Marseilles), Union Company (via San Francisco), North German Lloyd (via Colombo and Port Said). Seven mails per month are sent to and received from England.

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Education Act of 1880. Teachers are recognised as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The school fee is 3½d. per week per child, and the fees collected are paid into the Treasury as revenue. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

In 1891 there were 2,724 State schools in operation, namely, 5 high schools, 2 for boys and 3 for girls, 1,930 public schools, 348 provisional schools, 341 half-time schools, 85 house-to-house schools under itinerant teachers, and 15 evening public schools. The Colony has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction may be imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective churches. For the year 1892 the net cost to the State of public instruction was about £690,871. In 1892, 210,641 children attended the ordinary State schools, and 1,320 were inmates of the orphan schools, industrial schools, and the school for the deaf and dumb and the blind. In 1891, private schools, including church schools, showed an attendance of 45,018 children.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1851. Its State endowment was originally £5,000, but is now £12,000 per annum—£5,000 additional having been voted in 1882, and £2,000 more in 1883. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The Parliamentary grant for 1892 amounted to £18,100. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of £500 per annum. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, and science. Recently several faculties have been added to its curriculum. The number of students in 1891 was 1,688, of whom 540 had matriculated. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, attended by 495 pupils, and having a State endowment of £1,500, and a total vote for 1891—for endowment, buildings, and salaries—of £2,800. There is also a technical college, under the Department of Education, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns, the fees are within the reach of all, and the college is open to males and females alike. During 1892 306 classes were held, and 8,295 students attended; the Government advanced the sum of £33,485 during the year. Public libraries and schools of arts, to the number of 189 (no returns for 1891) were in operation in New South Wales during 1890. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, a Geographical, and an Art Society, a government observatory, with many other educational associations of a like character. The year's expenditure for the Sydney Free Library was £9,682, for the Museum, £7,704, and for the National Art Gallery £6,981.

The total State grant available for 1892 for educational purposes was about £818,998. In addition to this amount £6,952 was granted by the Government to university and affiliated colleges.

Defence.

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, George and Bradley's Heads, also at Newcastle and Botany, and along the coast.

The Military Forces consist of:—(a) Regular Forces:—General Staff, 39; Medical Staff Corps, 15; Artillery, 549; Submarine Miners, 22; (b) partially paid Volunteers:—Permanent Staff, 11 (unattached); Medical Staff Corps, 108; Honorary Staff, 3; Artillery, 541; Engineers, 117; Submarine Miners, 122; Cavalry, 382; Mounted Infantry, 385; and Infantry, 2,585; (c) Volunteer Reserves:—Infantry, 74; Commissariat and Transport Corps, 40; and Rifle Volunteer Companies, 4,873.

The Naval Forces are a Naval Brigade, numbering 331, partially paid, and 269 Naval Artillery Volunteers, purely voluntary. The Naval Defence Force Staff, the "Wolverene," and Torpedo Boats, number 19 men. There are 75 in the Ordnance Store Department. Including the general Staff, Volunteer, Permanent and Medical Staff, there is a total force (military and naval) of 10,560 of all ranks.

Local Government.

This is regulated mainly by Act No. 12 of 1887. Under this Act there have been established 166 boroughs and municipal districts, controlling property of the annual value of £8,045,444, and
having a revenue in 1892 of £47,294l., exclusive of loans, an expenditure of £1,220,007l., and an outstanding debt of £2,093,050l.; but against this is an accumulated sinking fund of £161,671l.

The chief towns and their population will be found at p. 183.

**Constitution.**

The first legislative council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council now consists (31st December, 1891) of 69 members, who are not paid.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880" (44 Vict., No. 13), consists of 141 members, representing 74 electoral districts; and provision is made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extends to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," with certain special exceptions. The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved. Under a law passed in 1889, members receive 300l. per annum.

The electoral franchise is given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in District.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 100l., or of the annual value of 10l., respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of 10l., or who shall hold, and for the said 6 months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

Number of electors enrolled in 1892, 314,156.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Act of 1858, now repealed.

A new Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1893, provides for the division of the Colony into 125 electorates, each represented by only one member. The next Parliament will, therefore, number 16 less than the present. The new Act also abolishes the property qualification and plural voting, and establishes the "one-man—one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalized subject, and who shall have resided in the Colony for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district for which he claims an elector's right, is qualified as an elector. Under this law the elections all take place on one and the same day.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long.), and is contiguous to the low archipelago (Tua-motu) which is under French protection. It was discovered by Cartaret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1789, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1873 these had increased to 76, and in 1879 to 90.
NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of a small group of islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 2' S. lat. and 167° 48' E. long., the chief other islets being Philip, Nepean, and Bird Islands. They comprise altogether about 12 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Capt. Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there from Botany Bay. This was removed in 1855, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 150 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population on 31st December, 1887, was 741. At the census of 1891 it was 738. The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There is but little regular administration, but the community is presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, the elder being Stephen Christian, with a simple code of laws. The community is under the superintendence of the Governor of New South Wales, and is visited occasionally by him. Communication with the group is now maintained by a sailing vessel once in every three months, subsidized by the Imperial Government. There is a resident doctor, and an efficient school. The chief village is Kingston, on the largest island.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.

Lord Howe Island is a dependency of New South Wales. Its census population in 1891 was 55 persons. It is a mountainous, well-wooded island, of small dimensions, remarkable for its equable and delightful climate. It is situated about 600 miles E. of Sydney, in 31° 30' S. lat. and 159° 25' E. long., and forms part of the Colony, being administered by a visiting magistrate.

The islet of Ball's Pyramid lies between Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands.
