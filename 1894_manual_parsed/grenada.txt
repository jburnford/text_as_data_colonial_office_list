GRENADA.

Situation, Area, &c.

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 6,031 souls.

General Description.

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and bushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 3,200 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. All the roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. There are about 40 miles of driving road in various directions, and the perfect network of byways, all in first rate order, shows that the important item of inland communication has not been overlooked. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1892, 67 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 987 tons. The town has a population of 5,000.

The other towns in the island are Charlotte Town (or Gouyave), Victoria, in St. Marks, St. Patrick (or Sauteurs), and Grenville (or La Baye). Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race, except the Indian population, which amounts to 2,118 souls.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. Yellow fever, the bugbear...
of the West Indies, is almost unknown, and if new arrivals do get a touch of "acclimatizing fever," which is far from being the rule, it is mild and soon disappears. The average annual rainfall for the last three years is 82½ inches, and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer for the last five years are 93° and 64° respectively, the average mean temperature being 79.5 in the shade.

The island is a great health resort for the neighbouring colony of Trinidad, and in addition to the restoring influence of the climate, it affords excellent sea bathing.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. Unlike the other islands however it has long ceased to be a sugar producing colony, and has therefore not suffered so severely as they have from the depreciation in the value of cane sugar. There are very few sugar estates at present in cultivation. The chief produce of Grenada is, and has been for some time, cocoa, of which 75,369 cwt., of the total value of 226,107l., were shipped in 1892. The export of this product increases annually, and when the above shipment is compared with the shipments of 1885 (49,107 cwt.) and 1880 (42,154 cwt.), it will be seen to what an extent the cultivation of cocoa has increased. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such for instance as cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, cocoanuts, &c. Nutmeg cultivation now occupies a prominent position, and is being largely developed. So general is the cultivation of spices carried on here, that Grenada is already called "The Spice Island of the West." The export of spices has increased from 3,483l. in 1890, to 15,650l. in 1892. Tropical fruits of almost every description, and of the finest quality, are always abundant, and large quantities are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. Experimental shipments of mangoes have been made to New York, with satisfactory results, and it is confidently expected that a large and flourishing fruit trade will ere long be established with America. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, tannias, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, &c. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and all the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullet wood, locust, mahogany, white cedar, galba, &c., and large quantities of firewood are exported to Barbados. A considerable quantity of rum is manufactured here for local consumption, the total number of gallons in 1892 being 58,875.

The main imports are food stuffs, textiles, timber, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are Indian corn, cotton, and cotton seed, cocoanuts, ground nuts, hides and skins, whale oil, and live stock (principally goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry).

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,653; estimated acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, under cultivation, 22,050.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George, established in 1887, with 708 depositors and 5,408l. deposited. Branch banks were opened in the out districts on 1st April, 1889; the number of depositors on 31st December, 1892, was 196, and 1,488l. deposited.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was named Ascension. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1787 St. George's was made a free port.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation.

Constitution.

There was formerly a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members, and regulated by an Act of 1854.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, in lieu of the Legislative Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieutenant-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council has been established by the Queen, consisting of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The unofficial members hold their seats for six years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, under which Grenada was made the head-quarters of the group.

Education.

There are 9 Government elementary schools, and 23 aided schools. The latter are under the
local management of the ministers of the different religious sects. Building grants have been made by the Government to assist in establishing schools in districts requiring them, and annual grants in aid are made on the result of inspections. The central administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1888 an Ordinance was passed imposing upon parents as a legal obligation the duty of providing elementary education for their children. In 1892 the average attendance was 3,248 children, the number on the rolls being 6,247. Fees are charged in all schools. There is a grammar school for boys, and two schools for the secondary education of girls, all of which receive grants in aid from the general revenue.
