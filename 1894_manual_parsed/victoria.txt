VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 84th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and on the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the colony meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 31' S., longitude 149° 39' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,944,628 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west, by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places. That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its
spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other colonies of the group, that it now contains 37 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The estimated population on the 31st December, 1892, was 1,167,373, viz., 607,801 males and 559,572 females. Those numbers give a proportion of 92 females to 100 males, or 109 males to 100 females.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 570 miles, and by land 574 miles; from Adelaide by sea 482 miles, and by land 575 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number about 1,770; the total number of letters despatched and received in 1890 was 62,526,448, of which 54,656,357 were inland, 5,929,822 were intercolonial, and 1,940,269 were British and foreign. The number of packets which passed through the post office during that year was 7,491,316, and the number of newspapers was 22,729,005. The postal and telegraph revenue is not accurately known, but was estimated to have been 502,800l. in 1891-92, and the expenditure was 756,190l.

Victoria, with the other Australasian colonies, having joined the Universal Postal Union from 1st October, 1891, the rates of postage are now uniform for all countries outside Australasia; they are as follows:

| Letters. | Newspapers. |
|----------|------------|
| Town and country | 2d. per oz. | each |
| Intercolonial | 2d., ½ oz | |
| United Kingdom and foreign countries | 2½, , , 1 |

There are 2,908 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1892, was 37,085,309l. The revenue for 1891-92 was 3,095,122l.; and the expenditure 2,138,139l.

There are about 7,100 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 14,000 miles of wire; also about 8,700 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams during 1892 was about 2,726,000; about 92,000 being on Government business were transmitted free. There are 11 telephone exchanges in the colony, with 2,439 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1891-92 was 166,248l.

Stage coaches run to all parts of the Colony where railway communication is not available.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57·4°, the mean atmospheric pressure at 91·3 feet above the sea level was 29·94 inches; rain falls on the average upon 180 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25½ inches.

History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England, he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonization, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year, an attempt was made to colonize the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention.

The two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from...
the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the as yet unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales, speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Dieman's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is agriculture, 2,970,000 acres being under cultivation in 1892-93. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 1,342,504 acres, producing 14,815,000 bushels; oats, 177,645 acres, producing 4,574,816 bushels; barley, 87,538 acres, producing 774,207 bushels; potatoes, 40,594 acres, producing 142,623 tons; and hay, 512,648 acres, producing 740,049 tons. About 26,000 acres are devoted to the culture of the vine, producing annually about 2,000,000 gallons of wine. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown extensively. On the 31st March, 1893, it is estimated that there were in the colony 439,596 horses, 1,824,704 cattle, 12,955,306 sheep, and 290,389 pigs. The wool exported in 1892 amounted to 165,590,000 lbs., valued at £6,619,000. The amount of gold raised in 1892 was 654,456 oz., making a total since 1851 of 58,070,215 oz., valued at £232,280,860. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and promising seams of true coal have recently been discovered and are being worked, but in other respects the mineral products are inconsiderable. The chief exports other than wool and gold (which comprise one-half of the total), are grain and flour, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are textiles and apparel, alcohol, sugar, tea, coal, hardware, and machinery. Nearly half the trade is with the United Kingdom, and more than a third with the other Australasian Colonies, only one-seventh being with foreign countries. The latter consist principally of the following:—Germany and France, United States, Java, Belgium, and China, in the order named. Melbourne does 84 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warnambool; also Echuca, Wodonga, Wangungah, Tocumwal, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1892 numbered 424, with a total tonnage of 119,813.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments of an extensive character, except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on therein; were this done, the manufactories of the Colony might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. According to the latest returns, there are in the Colony 98 flour mills, which during the year operated upon 8,892,090 bushels of wheat and 318,724 bushels of other grain; 68 breweries, in which 17,505,463 gallons of beer were brewed; 215 brick yards, some being also potteries, which made 207,270,000 bricks, and pottery valued at £79,319; 128 tanneries, fellmongeries, and wool-washing establishments, which tanned 1,925,566 hides and skins, stripped 2,300,000 sheep skins, and washed over 11,000,000 lbs. of wool; 7 woollen mills, which used 2,474,441 lbs. of wool, and produced 1,197,000 yards of tweed, cloth, and flannel, 3,000 pairs of blankets, and 1,336 shawls; 34 soap and candle works, which made 140,000 cwt. of soap, and 61,000 cwt. of candles; 13 tobacco manufactories, which manufactured 1,064,797 lbs. of tobacco, over 10,600,000 cigars, 1,670,000 cigarettes, and 1,100 lbs. of snuff; 6 distilleries, which made 456,500 gallons of spirits; 191 establishments working in books or stationery; 6 in musical instruments; 18 in carving and figures; 8 in designs, medals, and dies; 5 in philosophical instruments; 4 in surgical instruments; 8 in arms and ammunition; 367 in machines, tools, and implements; 302 in carriages and harness; 18 in ships and boats; 65 in houses, buildings, &c.; 122 in furniture; 56 in chemicals; 249 in dress; 24 in fibrous materials; 100 in animal food; 50 in vegetable food; 199 in drinks and stimulants; 59 in animal matters; 529 in vegetable matters; 46 in coal and gas; 242 in stone, clay, earthenware, and glass; 9 in water (ice making); 26 in gold, silver, and precious stones; and 53 in metals other than gold and silver. The total number of these establishments is 3,320, of which 1,810 use steam or gas engines, the total horse power of which is 31,614. They employ 53,525 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is £16,673,581.

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a
great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other colonies. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. The more important works connected with the principal rivers to provide for the supply for local schemes, are undertaken by and under the direct control of the state. These are known as "National Works," the total expenditure on which to 30th June, 1892, amounted to £682,500l. Local schemes are carried out by "Irrigation and Water Supply Trusts," constituted by the Governor in Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Loans are advanced by the Government, and the Commissioners are empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation within the area under their jurisdiction, in order to provide the annual interest on the loan and the necessary payment to the sinking fund; also to defray the current expenses attendant upon the operations of the trust. On 30th June, 1892, there were twenty-nine of these trusts, having jurisdiction over 2,700,000 acres of land, of which about two-thirds is capable of being irrigated, and with power to borrow £1,451,000l., of which £787,700l. has already been obtained.

Irrespective of the national irrigation works, an irrigation colony has been established since October, 1887, by two Canadian gentlemen named Chaffey, in a part of the Wimmera district abutting on the River Murray, previously believed to be of little value. The terms on which the concession has been granted by the Government to the Messrs. Chaffey are that they shall expend a total sum of £300,000l. in twenty years in irrigation works, agriculture, horticulture, and the establishment of a fruit-preserving industry, in consideration of which, and the fulfilment of certain other conditions, they will eventually become possessed of 250,000 acres of land, with the right to irrigate the same from the waters of the Murray. The lands are to be sold outright at the price of 20l. per acre for fruit-growing, and 15l. per acre for general agricultural purposes. The colony is named Mildura. Already £275,000l. up to 30th June, 1891, had been expended by Messrs. Chaffey, and about £100,000l. by the settlers, in improving their land. Over 17,000 acres are in the hands of purchasers and cleared, whilst fully 7,000 are under cultivation, about 6,500 being devoted to vines or fruit trees, and a further 3,000 acres were cleared for cultivation. Although the raisin industry promises to be the leading one at Mildura, excellent dried apricots, peaches and figs have also been produced, whilst the orange trees, which were only two years old, are found heavily laden with fruit. Every fruit except the apple flourishes at Mildura, and the products are in great demand in the Melbourne market. A handsome town, which with the surrounding district already has a population of about 4,000, is springing up, with public buildings, churches, &c., and a railway will shortly connect the settlement with other centres of population.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, is the most populous city in Australasia, having, with its suburbs, at the time the census of 1891 was taken, a population of 490,896. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835. The other chief towns are Ballarat (46,030), Bendigo (Sandhurst) (37,238), Geelong (24,283), Warrnambool (6,582), Castlemaine (5,982), and Stawell (5,183).

Chinese.

By the Chinese Immigration Restriction Act, 1888, the immigration of Chinese is limited to one Chinese to every 500 tons known of any vessel arriving. There are not more than 9,400 in the Colony.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering about 550 in all, throughout the Colony during the first quarter of 1893: the Bank of Australasia of New South Wales, of New Zealand, of Victoria, City of Melbourne, Colonial of Australasia, Commercial of Australia, English Scottish and Australian Chartered, London Chartered of Australia, National of Australia, Royal Australia, and the Union of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to £39,879,288l., and the value of the notes in circulation to £1,208,186l.

There are also 388 Post Office and ordinary Savings Banks throughout the Colony. The number of accounts open at the end of the year 1892 was 315,404, and the amount on deposit was £5,993,215l. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of over £8,000,000l. is coined annually.

Education.

Educational establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education; private schools for both primary and secondary education; and technological schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognized in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1891 was 635. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1891, the total number of students who matriculated was 8,271, and 1,457 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technological schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, embrace 13 Schools of Art, 9 Schools of Mines, and 8 Working Men's Colleges. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes, open to women as well as men; the average number of enrolments of individual students in 1891 was 2,394.

The system of primary public instruction which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. With certain exceptions, it is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 18, and it
is free for the ordinary course of instruction. In 1892 there were 2,140 State schools, with a total enrolment of 248,725 scholars, instructed by about 4,977 teachers. The average attendance was 141,638. In 1891-92 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was £40,554. There is no local control over the schools, and the teachers are paid partly by a fixed salary, and partly by results.

The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1891-2, there were 759 private schools in Victoria, with 1,995 teachers, and an attendance of 37,203 scholars. Of these schools, the Roman catholic denomination had 208, with 705 teachers and 21,799 scholars.

Australasian Federal Council.

Victoria has taken a leading part in promoting the Federation of the Australasian Colonies, and was mainly instrumental in procuring the passing of the "Federal Council Act of Australasia" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act creates a Council of two members from each Colony, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which have only one member each, with power to Her Majesty at the request of the Legislatures of the Colonies to increase the number of representatives for each Colony by Order in Council. This Council has power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits, service, and enforcement respectively of civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they have been passed, the extradition of offenders, and the custody of offenders on ships belonging to Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two or more Colonies may also refer to it for legislation questions of defence, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and joint stock companies, and other matters of general Australasian interest; but legislation of the Council on such matters is to extend only to the Colonies by whose Legislatures the matters shall have been so referred, and such Colonies as may afterwards adopt the same. It has also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent.

The Council is to meet at least once in every two years. The first meeting took place at Hobart, on 25th January, 1886, when representatives were present from Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed extending the operation of warrants and judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented, and various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits. The second session opened at Hobart on 16th January, 1888. An address was adopted to Her Majesty respecting the deportation of French criminals to the Pacific. An Act was also passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Beche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Queensland.

The Council met for its third session on 29th Jan., 1889, when representatives from South Australia were present for the first time. The amendment of the basis of representation in the Council was discussed at the session, and communications on the subject have since passed with the Imperial Government. The fourth session opened at Hobart 20th January, and closed 24th January, 1891. South Australia was not represented, the Act (a temporary measure for two years only) under which that province joined the Federation having expired. The only Bill passed was one to facilitate the recognition in other colonies of Orders and Declarations of the Supreme Court of any colony in matters of Lunacy. An address to Her Majesty was also adopted referring to the desirability of British subjects being placed on an equal footing with subjects of other countries in regard to the acquisition of land in, and trading with, natives of the New Hebrides. South Australia was not represented at this session.

The fifth session was commenced at Hobart on 26th January, 1893, when the colonies of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia were represented. An Act was passed providing for the discipline and government of the garrisons established at King George's Sound and Thursday Island; and a resolution was adopted in favour of an increase in the number of representatives for each Colony, except any Crown Colony, to five. The Standing Committee was instructed to take steps for giving effect to this resolution, and also for securing the adhesion of the Colonies not represented in the Council.

Australasian Federation.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Federal Council, however, a movement has been made for the establishment of a more perfect Federation, to embrace a Federal Executive, as well as Legislature, somewhat upon the model of Canada. Towards the end of 1889 negotiations were opened between the various Australasian Colonies, the result being that a Conference of the seven principal Australasian Colonies was held in Melbourne, on the 6th February, 1890. At this Conference it was unanimously agreed that the best interests of the Australian Colonies would be promoted by their "early union under the Crown," and that the Legislatures of the various Colonies should be invited to appoint to a National Australasian Convention during the year 1891 delegates empowered to report upon scheme for a Federal Constitution. In accordance with these resolutions, delegates were appointed, and the Convention commenced its deliberations in Sydney on the 2nd March, 1891. After an animated debate, which lasted more than a fortnight, a "Bill to Constitute a Commonwealth of Australia" was drawn up and adopted. This Bill the Convention recommended should be submitted for the approval of the people and Parliaments of the several colonies. It provided for the union of the Australasian Colonies in a Federal Commonwealth under the Crown, for a Governor-General to be appointed by the Crown, who should be aided and advised by an Executive Council, the constitution of a Senate and House of Representatives, with certain definite powers, the latter to have the initiation of money bills, which the former might pass or reject, but not amend, and for the
establishment of a Federal Judicature; the revenue of the Commonwealth to be derived from the Customs and Excise duties, which should be collected by Federal officers, and expended as required for Federal purposes, any surplus to be returned to the respective colonies. It also provided for absolute free trade internally throughout the Commonwealth, so soon as the Parliament should have imposed uniform Customs duties.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Ministry. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 48 members elected for fourteen Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 95 members returned by 84 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

One of the Members of Council returns for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years, so that the tenure of seats is six years; and there is a further special election once every six years for an extra Member for six of the provinces. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council. The property qualification of Members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 100l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 25l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of Members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is under ordinary circumstances three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856.

All Members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." Members of seven years' standing are allowed free passes for life over Government railways. The Members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,077 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the Colony. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the Members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1892 there were 60 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 139 shires. The number of ratepayers was 288,947; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 13,607,811l., representing a value in fee simple of 197,885,150l.; the total income (including 515,316l. received from Government) was 1,767,047l., and the expenditure was 2,084,903l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1891 was 180,328l., and its expenditure 478,649l. The debt of the Trust at the end of 1891 amounted to 1,500,000l., and the debts of the various municipalities to 3,143,602l.: an aggregate local indebtedness of 4,643,602l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works also were recently transferred to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis.

Defences.

The volunteer land forces, including militia, at the end of 1891 comprised an establishment of 7,860 men of all arms, of whom 406 were officers.

The fleet, which has an establishment of 616 men, comprises the armoured turret-ship "Cerberus," the wooden frigate "Nelson," the gunboats "Victoria" and "Albert," the torpedo boats "Childers," "Countess of Hopetoun," "Nepean," "Lonsdale," and "Gordon"; the steam launches "Commissioner," and "Customs No. 1," the Harbour Trust dredges "Batman," "Fawkner," "Gannet," and the steam patrol boats "Lion" and "Spray," and the steel Customs steamer, "Lady Loch."
