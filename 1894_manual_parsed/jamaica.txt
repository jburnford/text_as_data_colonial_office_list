JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 43' and 18° 32', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 20'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,207 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,360 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the S.W., and the Rio Grande in the N.E. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 48,504, stands at the mouth of the Cobre River. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 18° 10' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 30' and 80° 35' W. long., are dependencies of Jamaica. The largest of the islands, Grand Cayman, contains about 2,000 inhabitants, who as well as the inhabitants of the other two, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are mainly engaged in catching turtle for export. Pedro and Morant Cays are also dependencies, being two guano islands in 17° N. lat., as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands.

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,720,000 acres, from which may be deducted 365,828 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,317,962 acres available for cultivation. Of this 666,741 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1892. The dependencies have an area of 89 miles.

History.

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Haymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay,
by Esquimel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, while Governor of Hispaniola. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II, who appointed G. D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid.

The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. This town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. The capital was then transferred for a time to Kingston, on the opposite side of the harbour. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of Spanish slaves who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received £6,161,927 of the £20,000,000 granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A serious rebellion among the black population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°10', rising to 87°80' in the daytime, and falling to 70°70' at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons are in May and October, and last for about three weeks; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches at sea level to as much as 197 inches at Blue Mountain Peak.

Only two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, four-fifths being pure negroes. There are about 12,000 imported coolies, and about 200 Chinese. English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, granted by Charles I. in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, actually introduced a bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature willingly responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor and four ex officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Director of Public Works, and such other persons not exceeding five in number as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and nine persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved. The Governor has now been withdrawn from the Council, the Presidency of which has been entrusted to a gentleman nominated by the Crown with only a casting vote, and the members may nominate a Vice-President.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General, and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of Her Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

Local Administration.

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 13 other parishes, under Law 16 of 1885, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, water works, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population 1891,48,504), Port Royal (population 1,200), Spanish Town (population 5,689), Montego Bay (population 4,651), Falmouth (population 3,029), and Port Maria (population 6,741).

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., poorhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The several direct taxes received on land, houses, horses, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected.

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1891 was £156,165.; their expenditure £135,897., and their debt at the end of the year £1,1047. These figures form part of the general revenue and expenditure as given on p. 132.
There is a High Court of Justice, and Petty Sessions of magistrates throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the Courts of Petty Sessions.

An "island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an ad valorem duty; the excise on rum (120,020l. in 1892-93), and stamps and licences. There is no direct taxation except that of the local boards, and the total of the direct taxes on land is less than 27,000l.

Defence.

The constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are 19 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 743 sub-officers and men, and 1,512 rural police distributed throughout the island.

There is an Imperial garrison of 1,638 men, stationed near Kingston, and a naval station at Port Royal. There is a volunteer militia force with an establishment of 600 officers and men.

Currency and Banking.

British currency, United States gold, and gold doubloons are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000l. The Colonial Bank and the bank of Nova Scotia are the only private banking establishments in the Colony, the colonial bank has 1 branch and 4 agencies; it has a note circulation estimated at 125,000l. British silver coins above 6d. are legal tender to any extent; under 6d. to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent. The total deposits on 31st March, 1892, were 428,348l.

Education.

Elementary education is left to private enterprise, aided, since 1867, by a system of grants in aid from the Colonial revenue. The number of schools is 877, with 83,731 scholars, and the grant in aid for 1892 was 30,736l.; small fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for female teachers which is wholly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational and three denominational colleges for male teachers. More than 150 students are now under training. By laws just passed (1892) a Board of Education has been constituted, and provision made for the opening of Government secondary schools where required. No provision is made from public funds for technical education, but there are some endowed schools and scholarships tenable at the English universities.

Industry.

Fruit, consisting of bananas, oranges, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges in 1892-3 being 23,192,992. The value of the total export in 1892-3 exceeded 400,000l.

The other chief crops are sugar (export 371,821 cwt., value 241,863l.); coffee (export 97,304 cwt., value 340,563l.); ginger (export 13,631 cwt., value 27,263l.); and pimento (export 69,746 cwt., value 59,284l.), and the exports comprise, in addition to those products, rum (export 1,698,272 gallons, value 191,055l.); dyewood (export 99,082 tons, value 836,752l.); cocoa (export 8,495 cwt.; value 21,237l.), &c. The area under sugar cane in 1892 was 32,466 acres, and under coffee 21,450. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations.

The coffee and cinchona plantations are mainly on the Blue Mountain range, the richest sugar growing area being in the valley of the Plantain Garden River, in the parish of Portland, which also includes the town of Bath, with a famous mineral spring, and the great fruit growing district with Port Antonio for its outlet. Sugar is also largely grown in the district of Vere in Clarendon parish, and in the seaward parts of St. James and Trelawny, where the best rum in the world is said to be produced. The cattle raising districts are in St. Ann's, and in Hanover and Westmoreland and the western part of St. James. The uplands of Manchester parish are rich in coffee and fruit. St. Elizabeth parish grows a large quantity of logwood and other dye woods, as well as maize and fine pasture for horses.

The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, alcohol, and building materials. Of the whole trade, 52 per cent. is with the United Kingdom, and 34-8 per cent. with the United States, the next most important country being Canada.

Means of Communication.

There is a regular postal service throughout the island, daily between some places, and elsewhere three times per week, by means of mail coaches.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Within the Colony, per ½ oz. | 1 ½d. each. |
| Ditto, elsewhere | 1 ½d. each. |
| To Postal Union and other countries, per ½ oz. | 2½d. per 4ozs. |

Parcels post with England, 9d. per lb.; with United States and British W.I. Colonies, 6d. per lb.

The estimated number of letters sent to the United Kingdom is 129,900, and the number sent to other places 129,200.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail contract steamers leave Southampton on every alternate Wednesday throughout the year. The average passage is 16 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the two cables from Cuba touch at, whence they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama.
A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 66 stations, is now in operation. The total mileage open is 767. The total cost of the telegraphs has been about 17,000l. The receipts in 1892 were 5,767l., and the expenses (not including interest and the cost of maintaining the lines) 6,382l.

The Railway extends from Kingston to Appleton, in the parish of St. Elizabeth, in one direction, a distance of 77 miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17 miles. The total length of line open is 94 miles. The railway has recently been purchased by an American syndicate who are under agreement to extend it to Port Antonio on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st March, 1893, six ships with aggregate tonnage of 194 tons, were registered at Kingston, two with a tonnage of 78 tons at Montego Bay.
