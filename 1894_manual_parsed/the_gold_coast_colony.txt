THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation, Area, and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast is the name given to that portion of Upper Guinea, between 3° W. long. and 19° 10' E. long., and is bounded on the West by the French settlements of Assinie, and on the east by the German colony of Togoland.

The country is inhabited by a large number of native tribes more or less independent of each other, but with similar customs and forms of government. Each tribe has its own head chief or king, and every town or village of the tribe a chief. The chiefs form the king's council, and assist him in dealing with matters affecting the general welfare of the tribe. The succession both to the king's and chiefs' stools is for the most part hereditary by the female side, the heir to the stool being the son of the occupant's eldest sister, or failing male offspring by his sisters, his brothers according to seniority, and back from them to the male offspring of his aunts on the father's side.

The principal coast tribes are the following:—Appolonia, Ahanta, Chama, Komende, Elmina, Cape Coast or Fanti, Winneba, Assin Gomon, Accra, Adangme, Awuna, Agbosome and Affiao. Some of these, on account of tribal differences are split up into divisions more or less independent of each other, and as education and civilization spread, a tendency to further disintegration develops itself.

In the interior the principal tribes are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wassaw, Sefwhi, upper and lower Denkera, Tchulul, Assin, Esse Kuma, Edjumako, eastern and western Akim, Akwapim, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepi, Kwahu, Atabubu, Shai, Ningo, Krekor, and Anum.

For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into thirteen districts, each presided over by a commissioner, who besides performing judicial duties as magistrate, is the Chief Executive Officer of the district. The head-quarters of each district, with two exceptions, are on the coast.

The districts are known by the following names:—Wassaw, Axim, Dixcove, Chama, Elmina, Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winneba, Accra, Pram Pram, Ada, Kwitta, and Volta River.

History.

It is generally accepted that the Gold Coast, with the adjacent territories bordering on the Gulf of Guineas, were discovered by French navigators in the fourteenth century. The first really historic accounts that are extant of the Gold Coast are dated 1366, when a company was formed at Rouen, to trade with West Africa. Thirty years later the French established themselves in force at a place which they named La Mine, now called Elmina, and built there a large castle, the towers and bastions of which are still well preserved. The Rouen Company remained predominant on the Coast for nearly a century, when their trade failed, and they finally abandoned it.

The fame of the wealth of the Gold Coast attracted a large number of adventurers of all nations to the Gulf of Guinea, and during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a vast number of factories were established at various points along the seaboard, and the trade of the coast was eagerly disputed by the French, Portuguese, Danes, English, Brandenburgers, Dutch and Swedes, who dotted the whole coast line with formidable forts, erected to defend their commerce.

In 1672 an English company was formed, called the Royal African Company, which built forts at Dixcove, Sekundu, Kommenda, Ananabu, Winneba, Accra, and Whyda, besides strengthening Cape Coast Castle, which was already in existence. It was succeeded in 1750 by the African Company of Merchants, constituted by Act of Parliament, with liberty to trade and to form establishments on the West Coast of Africa, between 20° N. and 20° S. lat. This company, which received an annual subsidy from the Government, suffered by the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, and was dissolved in 1821 by Act of Parliament, and the forts transferred to the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlements. The fort at Whyda was abandoned.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fantis in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Ensimankao, where on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowa, near Accra, in 1827. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831 between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government, had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only 4,000l. a-year, contrived to extend
and maintain the influence of his government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast Protectorate. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the Slave Trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, and a Lieut.-Governor appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of Native Affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

In 1850, the Danish forts at Christiansborg, Tessi, Ningo, Ada and Kitta were purchased from the King of Denmark for 10,000£., the Danish Protectorate, which included the country inhabited by the Shais, Krobos (Eastern and Western), Akimis (Eastern and Western), Akwapims, Akwamus, and Krepis being at the same time transferred.

In 1852 a large meeting of the native chiefs (afterwards known as the "Legislative Assembly") agreed to pay a poll tax in exchange for British protection. This tax gradually fell in arrear and was abandoned, though some was received up to 1861.

Interspersed amongst the British settlements there had always been a number of Dutch forts. This circumstance was an abiding source of embarrassment to the British Government, as the Dutch settlements being free ports, no appreciable customs duties could be imposed at the British ports. A partition of the coast was therefore effected by a Convention which came into force on the 1st of January, 1868, the Dutch taking the country west of the Sweet river, the British that lying to the east. The Dutch acquired Dixcove, Appolonia, Sekondi, and Kommenda; the British acquired Dutch Accra, Bororoku, Appam, Kormantine, and Mori. Her Majesty also relinquished to the King of Holland the protectorate over the two Wassaws, Appolonia, Tchuful, and Denkera.

The Dutch found their new possessions extremely unruly. Their authority was defied by the protected tribes of the interior, and their officers outraged and ill-treated on the coast; and by a convention, signed at the Hague in 1871, they abandoned to Great Britain the whole of their rights on the coast. Before the Convention was ratified, an assurance was first sought and received from the King of Ashanti that he had no claim on the Dutch settlements of Elmina, and the forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872.

Relations with Ashanti.

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwais, Juabins, Kokofus, Kumasis, Daniassis, Mampons, Nsutas, Nkwantas, Dadiassis, Otiensu, and Adjisis. Each tribe has its own king, but from time immemorial the King of Kumasi has been recognized as the King paramount of the Confederation. As King paramount, he succeeds to what is known as the "golden stool," and is installed by the Kings of Bekwai, Juabin, and Kokofu, the ceremony of enstoolment lasting several weeks, and being observed by the performance of native customs, which in times past consisted largely in the sacrifice of slaves.

On 9th Dec., 1872, the King of Ashanti, despatched from Kumasi an army of 40,000 men to invade the British Protectorate. His army crossed the Pra on the 29th of January, 1873, and spread itself slowly over the country, ravaging as it advanced. In April it met and defeated the Fanti allies at Dunkwa, and again in June at Jukwa, and then attacked the fortress of Elmina, where it was entirely defeated by the seamen and Marines of the Fleet, in conjunction with the Colonial Forces, all under the command of the late Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing.

After this the war languished for some time, until the late Captain, afterwards Sir John Glover, was commissioned to repair to the eastern districts of the Protectorate, and organise the tribes in that quarter for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, now Viscount, Wolseley, was despatched with troops to the Gold Coast. The British troops arrived early in December, but a good road to the Pra not having been completed, they were sent to sea again. In the meantime Sir Garnet Wolseley, by the aid of native levies, West Indian troops, and seamen and Marines, had been driving the enemy towards the Pra, which they crossed in the end of November. The white troops landed towards the end of December, and Sir Garnet Wolseley and his head-quarters crossed the Pra on the 20th of January. The King of Ashanti now begged for peace, and sent the captive missionaries and others to the British camp; but as his language and acts were not satisfactory, Sir Garnet Wolseley continued his advance, and on the 31st of January came into general engagement with the enemy at Amonful, where, after desperate resistance, he drove them from their position. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Kumasi. The King had fled to the bush. Negotiations were opened with him, but without result, and on the 6th Sir Garnet Wolseley quitted Kumasi and commenced his march to the Coast, the Royal Engineers firing the city as the force marched out. In the meantime Sir John Glover had been advancing from the east with Hansas and native allies, and on the 12th he passed through the burning ruins of Kumasi. On the 13th messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fommana, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Koh. By the Treaty of Fommana the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, to keep up a good road to the Pra, to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold, and to respect the independence of the Adansis, a tribe inhabiting the country between Pra and that of the powerful Ashanti tribe of Bekwai. King Kofi Kari-Kari was deposed, and was succeeded by King Mensah, who, in his turn, was deposed in 1881.

Early in 1881 fresh troubles broke out with Ashanti, the affair having at one time a serious aspect. Awusu, a prince of Gaman, who was also connected with the Ashanti Royal family, escaped from Kumasi, where he had been kept under surveillance, to Elmina. He was followed by Ashanti ambassadors, demanding that he should be at once sent back. These envoys brought with them the golden axe, an emblem which was considered by the Government to be a threat of war. The demand was of course refused, and preparations were commenced by Lieut.-Governor (now Sir Brandford) Griffith for the defence of the Protectorate. Reinforcements from the West India Regiments at Sierra Leone and the West Indies were despatched, a small Naval Brigade was landed, and early in March Sir Samuel Rowe, who had just been appointed Governor, arrived. About the same time Ashanti messengers were sent to
deny that any threat of war had been intended. The force in the Colony now consisted of about 1,200 men of the W.I. Regiments and Haussa Police. In April the Ashanti ambassadors were received by the Governor at Prasu, and eventually an apology from them, together with 2,000 ounces of gold as an indemnity, was accepted. The gold axe was sent home as a present to the Queen.

After an interregnum of about two years, during which period much trouble and disturbance of trade was occasioned through intrigues designed to replace Kari-Kari upon "The Stool," Kwaku Dua was elected king in April, 1884, but he died June, 1884.

After the death of Kwaku Dua II dissension broke out among the confederated tribes. The Kokofus and Juabins fought against each other, the latter were driven out of the country, a large number finding asylum within the Protectorate, and being located at Konforoduwa, where they have built a town and still reside. Dissensions also arose as to the succession to Kwaku. The Kokofus, Mampous, Noutas, Nkwantas and Dadiassis favoured the claims of Atcheri Boanda, while the Kumasis, Bekwais, Ofinsus and Adjisus advocated those of Prempeh. Wars ensued, resulting in great loss of life and injury to trade, and Captains Lonsdale and Barnett were therefore sent to Ashanti to endeavour to adjust differences, and in April, 1888, Prempeh, whose adherents had gradually driven their adversaries out of the country into the Protectorate, was recognised as king. He has taken the title of Kwaku Dua III, but has not been placed on the Golden Stool in accordance with native custom. He is still unrecognised by the Kokofus and other tribes who remain within the Protectorate rather than return to their respective countries and acknowledge his position. The Kokofus are located at Akrossi, in Western Akim.

King Prempeh has from time to time made overtures to the kings of the fugitive tribes with a view to their return, but so far unsuccessfully. In 1893, the Nkoranzas, a tributary tribe located in the country to the north of Ashanti, unsuccessfully endeavoured to assert their independence, and from this and other circumstances it would seem that Prempeh's rule is by no means popular with the Ashanti people.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by letters patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th of January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument Lagos was separated from the Gold Coast and formed into a distinct colony. Provision was made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Two unofficial members have been appointed to the Legislative Council.

By Order of the Queen in Council of 6th August, 1874, the Legislature was empowered to regulate by Ordinance or Ordinances all such powers as Her Majesty may enjoy in the protected territories.

The Supreme Court of the Colony was a Court of Appeal for Lagos, and also under the West African Order in Council, 1884, but legislation providing for the establishment of separate courts of appeal in each colony was passed in 1888.

**Climate.**

The climate is very unhealthy, especially for Europeans. In 1891 the death rate among the non-official European population was 32·7 per 1,000; and in 1892, 70·7 per 1,000; and among the European officials 30·7 per 1,000 in 1891; and 36·3 per 1,000 in 1892. No data are at hand for estimating the death rate among the natives. Infant mortality is great. The mean temperature in the shade during the past seven years was, at Accra, 85·31° F. The average annual rainfall at the same place and during the same period was 29·08 inches. The rainfall varies with the physical configuration of the country, and is very great in Akim and the mining districts of Tarkwa, Upper and Lower Wassaw, &c. The "first rains," or rainy season proper, begin in March and end in July, the "latter rains" are spread over the months of September and October. The Harmattan season begins in December and ends in February. It is characterized by a cool wind which is sometimes dry and bracing, but often moist and then very depressing. The climate generally is hot and moist and very malarious.

**Domestic Slavery.**

Domestic slavery existed from time immemorial on the Gold Coast, as in other parts of Africa, the slave population consisting partly of native-born slaves, and partly of Donkos, slaves purchased from Ashanti importers. Slavery was mainly an emanation of parental authority, every man being saleable either by his father or mother, according to the character of the union subsisting between his parents, and the consequent status of the mother; but there was also a species of slavery called pawning, founded on contract, which arose when a debtor gave to his creditor, as a security, either himself, or a child or slave, to be a temporary slave in the hands of the creditor until debt and interest were paid.

Within the British possessions on the Gold Coast, slavery was abolished by force of the statute 3 & 4 Will. iv., c. 73, but no attempt had been made to deal with it in the Protectorate, which was not affected by that statute. The harsher usages of slavery were, however, appreciably mitigated by the action of the court of the "judicial assessor to the Native Chiefs" and other magistrates. At the conclusion of the war of 1873-4 the question was taken in hand anew by the newly established Legislative Council at its first meeting, and settled by two ordinances. One of these prohibits, under penalties, the introduction of slaves into the Protectorate, and the buying and selling, and pawning of slaves and other persons within the Protectorate; and the second declares, that henceforth no court, native or British, shall take notice of, so as to give effect to, the relations between master and slave, except in so far as those relations may be in accordance with the law of England relating to master and servant.
Mail and Steamship Service.

A steamer of the "British and African," or of the "African Steamship" Companies leaves Liverpool every Saturday for the Gold Coast and other ports, the average length of the passage to Accra being 28 days. Every alternate Wednesday a steamer of the same companies leaves Liverpool for Accra and other ports, the average length of the passage being 19 days; the former steamers call at Madeira and the Canary Islands, and almost all the ports on the African Coast between Cape Verde and Accra, whereas the faster steamers call for mails and passengers only at Grand Canary and Sierra Leone before reaching Accra, 6 steamers of the "Woerman Line" also leave Hamburg every month for the Gold Coast and other ports.

Internal Communication.

There is no railway in the colony, but in 1893 a survey for a line from Saltpond, or a point in the immediate vicinity of that town, to the interior was commenced.

The only roads properly so called in the colony are, the road between Accra and Christiansborg, a distance of 2½ miles, the road from the latter place to the Government Sanitarium at Aburi, a distance of 26 miles, the military road between Cape Coast and Prahsu, a distance of 75 miles, and the road from Cape Coast to Anamalooe, a distance of 12 miles. In addition to these the road from Aburi through Akwapim and Eastern and Western Krobo to Kpong and Akuse, and the road from Chama to Tarkwa (Upper Wassaw) are all under more or less constant Government supervision, and on that account are kept in fair order. The native kings and chiefs who can be induced to keep their bush tracks clear of bush and passable for traders and travellers at all periods of the year are paid 10s. a quarter, per mile, and cutlasses and hatchets are loaned to them by the Government to assist them in the work, but it is only within the immediate vicinity of the several Government stations that the bush tracks are as a rule in fair order. A road overseer has been appointed in several of the districts, and the establishment of a Roads Department is under consideration.

The principal water way is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and falls into the sea at Ada, after a course of 200 miles. It is usually navigable for not more than 60 miles, and only for small boats. The Ankobra River is navigable for boats for about 50 miles. The Pra is almost useless as a waterway.

There is no harbour along the whole coast of the colony, and goods and passengers must everywhere be landed in surf-boats through what is often a dangerous surf.

Postal Communication.

The Colony is included in the Postal Union. Foreign money order and parcel post systems are in operation between it and the United Kingdom, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Lagos. An inland postal order system has been introduced for facilitating the exchange of small remittances between the principal stations in the Colony. A tri-weekly postal service is maintained between all the principal stations, a weekly service between the Colony and the French protectorate of Grand Bassem and Assinie, and a bi-weekly service between the Colony and the German protectorate of Togoland. The number of letters posted and received in 1892 was 225,293 and 264,804 respectively. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers, per ¼ oz. | per ¼ oz. |
|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Within the Colony                 | 1½d.     | 1½d.    |
| To the United Kingdom             | 2½d.     | 2½d.    |
| To Postal Union countries west of Suez | 4d.   | 1½d.    |
| To Postal Union countries east of Suez | 2½d. | 1½d.    |

(Parcels to and from England, 9d. per lb.)

Telegraphs and Telephones.

Telegraphs were first introduced in 1882, when a line, 2½ miles long, was put up between Accra and Christiansborg. This line was in 1885 extended to Aburi. Lines have since been constructed along the coast from Accra, a distance of 180 miles, to Axim, connecting the coast towns in the west of the Colony, and also extended as far as the German boundary on the east, a distance of 114 miles, joining the line erected by the German Government from Little Popo and Lome, and connecting the German settlement of Togoland with the telegraph system of the Gold Coast and with the cable communication with Europe. In 1893 the construction of a line from Ada at the mouth of the Volta, to Akuse and Kpong, towns of some commercial importance, between fifty and sixty miles up the river, was commenced. When this line is completed the Colony will possess 380 miles of telegraph lines, and twenty telegraph offices. Wooden poles were tried at first, but owing to the ravages of the white ant, iron poles were subsequently used, and have now almost entirely replaced them. In 1892 the number of messages forwarded was 46,654.

A telephone exchange was opened at Accra in 1890, providing communication between twenty public and private offices, and Aburi is connected with this exchange. Accra is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Sierra Leone, St. Vincent, Madeira; also with Grand Bassam on the west, and Lagos and Oil Rivers on the east. It is also connected with the Cape, via Kotou, St. Paul de Luanda, and Mossamedes, there being altogether four cables.

Defence.

Most of the stations along the coast have old forts, but there are no modern fortifications. A colonial armed constabulary force (Hausas) of 941 of all ranks is maintained, and may be increased according to circumstances. There is also a civil police force consisting of 450 of all ranks, and a volunteer force at Accra consisting of 100 men.

Education.

There are Government elementary schools at Accra and Cape Coast, providing instruction for 1,098 children in 1892, but education is chiefly in the hands of the Wesleyan, Roman Catholic, and Basel Missions, under inspection. The Wesleyans have 2,948 scholars in their schools, which are spread over the Colony, and they spend annually about £1,378l. on education, to which the Government contributed £1,060l. in 1892. The Basel Mission
Society has 2,192 scholars in 90 schools, scattered over the eastern parts of the Colony, and their annual expenditure on education is about 3,448l., to which the Government contribution was 672l.; and the Roman Catholic Mission at Elmina, Cape Coast, and Kwitta educate 1,189 children, receiving a grant of 436l. in 1892. English is being taught in these schools, chiefly in the higher classes, and the Basel Mission Society also teaches handicrafts and agriculture. The total number of children at school was about 7,572 in 1892. The total grants in aid paid on examination of missionary schools in 1892 was 2,167l. 6s. 6d. There is also a government school in connection with the Houssa constabulary, with 338 men on the rolls.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling, with Spanish, American, and French gold coins, as fixed by Ordinance No. 2 of 1880. Gold dust was demonetized by Ordinance No. 9 of 1889, but still remains a medium of exchange in the districts of the interior. A number of United States silver half-dollars are in circulation, but are not legal tender. Bronze coins are little used, owing to the dislike to them entertained by the natives. Cowries are still in use, but only for the purchase of articles of little value. Accounts are kept in sterling. There are no banks in the Colony, but in March, 1888, a Government savings bank was established, and had on the 31st December, 1892, a credit of 3,509l. 8s. 1d., in the names of 362 depositors. Penny Banks have also been established in the principal schools.

The rate of exchange is at par. Money orders, known under the name of "Telegraphic Transfers," are issued by the crown agents for the colonies on the treasurer, in favour of the persons in the Colony, whose agents in England have paid into the hands of the crown agents the amount for which the transfers are given. A charge of 1 per cent. on the value of transfers is made by the Government for this service, and when specie has to be transferred from Accra or elsewhere to meet the payment of the order, the cost of transport is also collected.

Population.

The census returns for 1891 give the population of the Colony and protected territories as 768,882, exclusive of the countries of Kwahu and British Krepi, but the census committee estimate that owing to the great difficulty in getting at the people in the interior parts of the Colony, and to the great reluctance on the part of the natives to be enumerated, an addition of 205,000 should be made to the returns. The estimated population of Kwahu and British Krepi is 500,000, making the probable total population 1,473,882. The chief towns are, Accra (16,276); Cape Coast (11,614); Elmina (10,530); Kwitta, Saltpond, Winneba, Axim, and Ada.

Trade and Industry.

The staple products of the territories are palm oil, palm kernels and rubber. The palm does not grow near the coast, and the produce is brought down on the heads of carriers from an area extending forty miles inland, and by canoe down the Volta River from a greater distance. Gold is found in many parts, notably in the Wassaw district, in the north-west, of which Tarkwa and Prestea are centres. Unsuccessful management, the distance of four of the mines from the nearest port (Axim), and the lack of a good road, have proved obstacles to successful mining on a large scale in the past, but much greater energy has been exhibited in mining enterprise since the year 1889, five companies with established plant and staff being now actively at work, and gold to the value of 120,805l. 17s. 3d. was raised and exported in 1892. The natives collect alluvial and sub-soil gold for trade export in considerable quantities, 56,937l. 18s. 9d. having been exported in 1892. Indiarubber abounds in the interior forests, and is rapidly becoming an important export. Cotton grows wild, but is not cultivated. Small quantities of coffee and ground nuts are grown, and the exports also include monkey skins, kola nuts, ivory, copra, guinea grains; gum, copal, camwood, and beniseed. An export of valuable native woods opened about two years ago promises to be an industry which will largely increase the export trade of the Colony. The quantities and values of the principal exports in 1892 were: cotton, raw, 28,862 lbs., value 441l. 4s. 1d.; cola nuts, 91 packages, value 1,828l. 7s. 3d.; dye stuffs and substances used in tanning, 21,300 lbs., value 69l. 2s.; ginger, 180 lbs., value 4l. 16s. 10d.; gold dust 27,446 oz. 1 ack. 1 tak., value 98,805l. 17s. 3d.; guinea grain, 53,095 lbs., value 457l. 14s.; gum copal, 36,593 lbs., value 489l. 6s. 8d.; ivory, 32,003 lbs., value 5,417l. 10s.; monkey skins and furs of all sorts, 188,930 Nos., value 34,822l. 18s. 2d.; palm kernels and other nuts for pressing oil therefrom, 16,008 tons 14 cwt., value 104,773l. 12s. 3d.; palm oil, 3,643,366 gallons, value 178,953l. 15s.; rubber, 2,653,020 lbs.; value 36,407l. 6s.; timber, 2,130,614 feet, value 166,659l. 16s. 8d. The trade with Salagha and Ashanti is slight, owing to the difficulties of communication and the frequent native wars. Fishing is extensively carried on. There are but few manufactures, and these on the smallest scale. Native cloth is woven, fish is salted and cured, bricks are made, and simple boats built. Gold is worked into native ornaments with some skill. The chief imports are textiles, alcohol, hardware, and cooperage. More than three-quarters of the total trade is with the United Kingdom, the rest being with the United States, Germany, Holland, and France.

In April, 1890, a Botanical Station was established at Aburi, where the Government Sanatorium is situated, at an elevation of 1,400 feet above the sea, and a curator from the Royal Gardens, Kew, appointed, the objects in view being to teach the natives the most approved methods of planting, to introduce fresh seed and trees from other tropical countries, and to develop the agricultural resources of the colony and increase the number of its economic exports generally. At present there are some 42 acres planted with cocoa, coffee, cotton, tobacco, jute, spices, eucalypti, and various fruit trees and other plants. These young plants will be for sale to European and native planters and chiefs, and it is intended to apprentice boys from the schools of the colony to the gardening work and ultimately to assist them to start fresh centres in other parts of the colony. A sample of cotton sent home from Christiansborg in 1890 is reported by Kew to have obtained the highest estimate of value put upon any sample of cotton received there as yet from West Africa.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The City of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains, with its suburbs, 200,000 inhabitants. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees.

The rainfall for 1892 was 90-97 inches at the Observatory Station, while the range of the thermometer was from 44°-2 to 93°-9. The rainy season extends from May to October.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843.

It did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1892 being 150,114 (principally to and from the Straits); emigrants, 52,143; immigrants, 97,971.

Industry.

The island produces little or nothing, but its position has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are a few manufactories, producing rope, sugar, rum, paper, vermilion, sauce, bricks, and bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping.

As Hong Kong is a free port, it is impossible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected, may be approximately estimated from the amount of the shipping. The exports from the fourteen principal countries to Hong Kong amounted in 1885 to 21,869,145l., and the imports into those countries from Hong Kong were 18,635,181l. Since that date the trade has greatly increased, and the total exports may now be estimated roughly at 25 millions, and the imports at 20 millions sterling. Nearly half of this trade is with China, and a third with India, mainly in tea, silk, and opium.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. There are five docks and three slips which are well supplied with shears, engineer's and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every
