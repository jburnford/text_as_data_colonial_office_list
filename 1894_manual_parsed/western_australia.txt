WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57′ S., long. 115° 52′ E.

Physical Features.

The coast line, extending for a distance of about 3,000 miles, is indented by a certain number of bays, creeks, and harbours, and in the northern parts fringed by numerous islands. In the south there are three separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The loftiest is the Blackwood range, the highest point of which is about 2,000 feet. The other ranges are known as the Darling and Roe, and these, with the exception of Mount William, in the Murray District, 3,000 feet high, do not reach greater altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea. In the northern part of the Colony there is the Leopold range, of about the same magnitude. The settled districts are usually level or undulating, rarely mountainous. The western seaboard is comparatively flat, of a sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation. To the eastward of the Darling range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character, and improves as you proceed inland, but to the east of long. 119° the country has hardly been explored at all. The north and north-eastern parts of the Colony contain a large area of good pastoral country, suitable also in some parts for the growth of tropical products, such as sugar and coffee.

The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the north, to Point D'Entrecasteaux in the south, a distance of about 300 miles.

Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this range, and flow into the sea to the westward.

The principal rivers of the Colony are the Ord, Pantou, Fitzroy, De Grey, Harding, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoyne, Murchison, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Preston, Blackwood, Warren, and Gordon. Most of these are mere storm-water channels filled only during the rainy season, and very few of them are navigable even for boats for any distance.

Lakes.

The lake district may be considered to be confined to the westward of the Darling range; within this area there are numerous salt and fresh water lakes and lagoons—but many of them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.

Numerous islands and islets occur along the coast-line. Dirk Hartog Island, in Sharks Bay, is the largest of those used for pastoral purposes. Whilst guano is found on the islands comprised in Houtman's, Abrolhos, and various islands to the north, including the "Lacepedes."

History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1828 Captain Gilbert, R.N., in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and in June, 1829, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1850, the Colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution was what is called "Representative" established by Act 33 Victoria, No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The legislature consists of two houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 15 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 30 members.

The Legislative Council is nominated by the Governor in Council, but becomes elective in 6 years, or when the population of the Colony reaches 60,000, whichever happens first.

The Legislative Assembly is elective. There are 30 electoral districts, each returning one member to the Legislative Assembly.

The qualification for member is a freehold estate of the value of 50l., or of the yearly value of 50l., of which he shall have been in possession at least 12 months previous to his election.

The qualification of electors is the possession for at least one year before registration, and within the electoral district for which he seeks to be registered, of a freehold estate of the clear value of 100l., or leasehold of the value of 10l. per annum, or a 10l. lease or license of Crown lands, or has occupied as a householder a dwelling house of the clear annual value of 10l., or as a lodger a room or rooms as lodgings of the clear value, unfurnished, of 10l. a year.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible ministers, who form the Cabinet:—the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Colonial Treasurer, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Railways.

Local Government.

Under Act 40 Vict., No. 13, as amended by 42 Vict., No. 16, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All licence fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Acts are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Perth, Fremantle, Albany, Geraldton, Bunbury, Busselton, Guildford, York, Newcastle, Northam, Roebourne, Cossack, Beverley, Carnarvon, and Southern Cross. The municipal councils, with the exception of the last two, which are presided over by a chairman, consist of a mayor and councillors, the mayor and chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licences to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. Under "The Water Works Act, 1889" (53 Vic. 13), the Perth City Council is authorized to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £; also under "The Public Health Act, 1886," Councils of Municipalities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 3d. in the £. 11,800l. was granted in 1892 to district roads boards (of which there are thirty-five), and municipal councils for the repair and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the Colony.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the Colony at the 31st December, 1892, was estimated to be 58,674, consisting of 36,095 males, and 22,579 females, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese was 918, of whom 912 were males and only 6 females.

The chief towns are Perth (11,117), Fremantle (5,867), Albany (2,858), Geraldton (1,252), York (1,733), Bunbury (644), and Guildford.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the Colony, 5,505,209 acres only have been alienated, while 98,488,186 acres are leased for pastoral, and 1,415,874 for other
purposes. No less than 524,348,149 acres are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 3,000 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, three hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley and Eucla districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes, but Geraldton is the centre of a fertile and flourishing agricultural district. In the south-west corner of the Colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the Colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total cultivated area is 161,466 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

The principal industry, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 1,885,500) are depastured in all parts of the Colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1892, principally to London, was 8,712,080 lbs., which, at 9d. per lb., is valued at 326,703l. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1892 was valued at 78,419l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and is exported to Singapore and China, to the extent of about 42,870l. during 1892.

At Sharks Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounted to 119,259l. in 1892.

Little has been known of the mineral resources of Western Australia till within the last few years. Lead and copper mines have been opened in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but, owing to the fall in the value of these metals, have had to stop work. It is believed that the copper ores in this district might now again be profitably raised.

Coal has been found, and is about to be worked near the River Irwin, and also on the Collie River and in various other places in the south of the Colony. It is also said to exist in the Kimberley District in the north.

Gold has been found in many places. At present the Colony possesses five promising goldfields at Kimberley, Pilbara, Ashburton, and Murchison in the north, and at Yilgarn, about 250 miles east of Perth, from which fields gold to the value of 226,264l. was exported during 1892.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood River, and this export appears for 1892 as valued at 18,843l. There is little doubt that a fairly rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in small quantities, near Perth.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Limited, Bank of New South Wales, and the Commercial Bank.

The total amount of their deposits for the quarter ending the 31st December, 1892, was £1,319,725 2s. 7d., and their note circulation £101,433l. 3s. 7d.

A Government Post Office saving bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863, and the deposits during the year 1892, amounted to £61,990l.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are governed by elected district boards, working under an appointed central board. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (35 Vict., No. 14), and are enforced.

Assisted schools of different denominations are also subsidised by the State. The amount expended on education for 1892 was £14,897l. A high school is also subsidised by the State. There is a high school for girls under the direction of the Anglican Bishop, and another conducted by the Sisters of Mercy.

In January, 1893, there were 96 Government schools in the Colony, with 4,082 scholars on the rolls, and 21 assisted schools, with 1,941 scholars; total 5,973.

Means of Communication.

The Colony possesses at present three lines of Government railways; a line (110 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, and with Guildford, York, and Beverley, with branch lines to Newcastle (14 miles) and to Northam (6 miles); a second line (84 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district, and from Geraldton to Greenough (17 miles); a third line from Bunbury to Boyanup (16 miles), making in all 198 miles of railway open for traffic. A line between Perth and Bunbury, about 111 miles in length, was opened for traffic in the beginning of 1893.

In addition to these the Great Southern Railway (243 miles) constructed by the West Australian Land Company, Limited, was opened for traffic on the 1st June, 1890. This line connects the port of Albany with the Government railway system at Beverley. Trains run daily between Perth and Albany.

Another railway, the "Midland," is being constructed on the land grant system, which when finished will afford communication between Guildford and Champion Bay, and connect the two Government railways.
Two sections of this railway have been opened for traffic, viz., Guildford to Gingin (40 miles), and Walkaway (Greenough) to Dongarra (20 miles). The line when completed will be about 276 miles in length.

There are also several lines constructed by private timber companies in the south of the Colony, in extent about 68 miles; also one, the Darling Range Railway, running from Guildford into the Darling Range (22 miles). The following lines are now under construction by Government:—Eastern Railway Extension to Yilgarn, 170 miles; Geraldton to Mullewa, 57 miles. The receipts of the Government railways in 1892 were £94,201, and the working expenses £90,564. The total cost of construction has been £914,823. Of electric telegraph at the end of 1892 there were 4,013 miles of wire, and 375 more miles in course of erection between Derby and Wyndham (Cambridge Gulf). The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1892 was 252,110, and the revenue received £14,997 (worked by Post Office Department); cost of Post and Telegraph, £49,975. There is telegraph communication with Europe, via South Australia, and also by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the Colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast.

The steamers of the P. & O. and Orient Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, and the other Australian colonies. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 30 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, Newspapers | per oz. papers |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Within a town        | 1d. Free*     |
| Australasia          | 2d. ½d. per 10 ozs. |
| United Kingdom and Postal Union | 2½d. 1d. per 4 ozs. |

The postal statistics for 1892 give the following as the number of letters and postcards, &c., received and despatched:

- English, Intercolonial, and Foreign: Letters and postcards 8,432,948; Newspapers 1,495,295; Packets and parcels 807,069.
- Inland: Letters and postcards 2,439,087; Newspapers 2,818,783; Packets and parcels 503,600.

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 150 vessels and a tonnage of 6,578 on 31st December, 1892.

**Defence.**

In December, 1892, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 610 of all ranks. Of this number 65 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder to the various rifle corps. King George's Sound, on the south coast, is being strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office. The port of Fremantle is also about to be fortified.

**Aborigines.**

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. They are very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement is very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are largely utilised as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule they are not hostile, though very troublesome when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. There is now a Board of Management appointed by the Governor, which deals with all matters connected with the aborigines.

**Climate.**

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate is 16·46 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33·55 inches, and the mean temperature is 65°. The rainy season extends from April to September.
