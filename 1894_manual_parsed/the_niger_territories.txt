THE NIGER TERRITORIES.

Situation and Boundaries.

These regions, estimated to cover about 500,000 square miles, and with a population estimated at 20,000,000 to 25,000,000, are secured to Great Britain by more than 300 treaties made by the Royal Niger Company (formerly the National African Company, Limited), and recognized by the Anglo-German Agreements of June, 1885, and...
June, 1886, and the Anglo-French Agreement of August, 1890. The agreements with Germany establish as an eastern frontier a line running from the Cross River to a little east of Yola, on the Upper Benue. The northern frontier of the Territories is settled by the agreement with France, and is to be a line drawn from Say, on the Middle Niger, to Barus, on Lake Chad, but diverted so as to leave within the Niger Territories everything that properly belongs to the kingdom of Sokoto. Under this agreement the Company claims the Saharan provinces of Air, or Asben, and Damergou; but this claim is contested by France, and will have to be settled by the International Commission referred to in the agreement. The same commission will settle the western frontier between France and the Niger Territories in the great bend of the Niger to the west of Borgu, a powerful kingdom which was about two years ago brought within the jurisdiction of the Company. Borgu bounds on the north the kingdom of Dahomey, with which France has lately been at war. The Territories are separated from the British colony of Lagos by that portion of Yorubaland which has not yet been conquered by the Mohammedans, nor brought within the jurisdiction of any European power. On the Gulf of Guinea the Territories occupy about 21 miles of coast line from the Forcados to the Brass River; the adjacent coast line on either side falling within the British Protectorate of the OIl Rivers, which is administered by a British Commissioner and Consul-General, Sir Claude MacDonald, assisted by a number of vice-consuls.

Administration.

The Niger Territories are governed from London by a Council, of which Lord Aberdare is Governor, Sir George Goldie Deputy Governor, and Mr. H. Morley Secretary. The Company exercises its jurisdiction under a Royal Charter, dated 10th July, 1886, by which their sovereign rights in the territories over which they have treaties were recognized, and authorized to be exercised.

Order is maintained in the Territories by native allies, by the Company's fleet of twenty to thirty steamers, and by a small force of disciplined troops. These consist of English officers and about 1,000 Hausas, chiefly trained as artillery, but also armed with Snider rifles. There is also a civil police force in each district commanded by the local magistrates. The headquarters of the troops is at Lokoja, at the junction of the Niger and Benue rivers. The capital, where are the supreme court, central gaol, main hospital, and other public institutions, is at Asaba, about half way between Lokoja and Akassa, the mouth of the Niger, on the Gulf of Guinea, which is the transhipping depot, and where are the repairing yards and engineers' works for the fleet of river steamers. A patent slipway—the first in West Africa—has lately been erected at Akassa for the repair of these. The other principal settlements are at Abo, Abutshi, Atani, Bakundi, Donga, Egba, Ibi, Idah, Leaba, Loko, Odeni, and Ribago, the latter being about 200 miles south of Lake Chad.

Climate and Products.

The lower portion of the Territories in the Niger delta has a bad reputation for its climate. In this region are produced the palm oil and palm kernels which form a large portion of the exports from the Territories. The regions further inland are stated to be much healthier, while their principal products are rubber, hides, ground nuts, shea butter, ivory, chillies, and various drugs.

The chief imports are cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, powder, salt, silks, spirits, and woollen goods. The Company have prohibited the importation of rifles, breech loading guns, cartridges, &c., into any part of the Territories. They have also prohibited the importation of spirits into the upper portions of their territories, and put heavy duties on their introduction into the lower portions, so that the importation of spirits is now less than one-fourth of what it was before the charter. There are no import duties excepting on guns, powder, salt, spirits, and tobacco. The revenue is chiefly raised by export duties.

According to the English Customs returns the value of the imports into England from the Niger Territory in 1892 amounted to £68,248l., and the exports to £11,366l.

Means of Communication.

There are telegraph stations at Brass and Bonny, in cable communication with Lagos, and thus with Europe. Regular steamers arrive and depart from Liverpool and the West Coast of Africa every three weeks. Communication in the Niger Basin is mainly by the steamers of the Royal Niger Company.

BRITISH ZAMBEZIA AND BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA.

BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA COMPANY.

Under the unofficial title of British Zambezia, is included the whole of the region lying to the north and west of the South African Republic and the southern boundaries of the Congo Free State, and having as its eastern and western boundaries the Portuguese and German spheres. The River Zambezi divides it into two portions, which may be described as Zambezia and British Central Africa respectively.

Zambezia.

The western boundary of Zambezia is defined by the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890, the
sphere of influence reserved to Germany being bounded (1) by a line from the mouth of the Orange River along the north bank to the point of its intersection by E. long. 20°; (2) from thence along E. long. 20° its intersection by S. lat. 22°, and thence eastward along that parallel to its intersection by E. long. 21°, and following that degree northward to its intersection by S. lat. 18°; it runs eastward along that parallel till it reaches the River Chobe, and descends the centre of the main channel of that river to its junction with the Zambezi, where it terminates.

Its eastern boundary, defined by the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement of the 11th June, 1891, is a line starting from a point opposite the mouth of the River Aroangwa or Louangwa, and running directly southwards as far as S. lat. 16°; follows that parallel to its intersection with E. long. 31°; and thence eastward direct to the point where the River Mazoe is intersected by E. long. 33°; it follows that degree southward to its intersection by S. lat. 18° 30'; thence it follows the upper part of the eastern slope of the Manica Plateau southwards to the centre of the main channel of the Sabi, follows that channel to its confluence with the Lunte, whence it strikes direct to the N.E. point of the frontier of the South African Republic, and follows the eastern frontier of the Republic, and the frontier of Swaziland to the River Maputo.

In tracing the frontier along the slope of the plateau no territory west of E. long. 32° 30' is to be comprised in the Portuguese sphere; and no territory east of E. long. 33° is to be comprised in the British sphere, but if necessary the line is to be deflected so as to leave Mutassa in the British sphere, and Massi-kessi in the Portuguese sphere.

In 1888 the southern region was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

The most important part of this territory is Matabeleland, ruled by King Lobengula, and including the country around inhabited by the Mashonas, Makalakas, and other tribes, who pay tribute to him. Matabeleland and Mashonaland are rich in gold reefs and other minerals, and the Mashona plateaus are well adapted for culture and European settlement. The area of Matabeleland and dependencies is about 125,000 square miles. The population of Matabeleland proper is estimated at 200,000; there is an army of 15,000, divided into regiments or kraals, and presided over by Indunas.

The British South Africa Company is further empowered to take over the administration of other districts in Africa, subject to the approval of the Government, including the region to the north and west of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, embracing Khama's territory and the region between that and the German boundary. The country, though desert in parts, is in the main well adapted both for cultivation and agriculture, being situated principally on the high healthy plateau of Central South Africa. Patrols of the Bechuanaland Border Police visit the various districts outside Matabeleland.

Since the grant of the Royal Charter, the Company has extended the Cape Government Railway System from Kimberley to Vryburg, a distance of 126 miles, and this section has since been taken over by the Cape Government. The Company has also undertaken to construct a further station from Vryburg to Mafeking, a distance of 98 miles. It has also extended the telegraph system from Mafeking to Fort Salisbury in Mashonaland, a distance of over 800 miles. Stations have been opened at Mafeking, Ramoutsa, Gaberones, Mochuli, Palla, Palapye, Macloutsie, Tuli, Nuanetsi, Victoria, Chartun, and Salisbury, and arrangements are now being made to continue the line northwards, via Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika and Uganda, to Egypt. Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lo Bengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Macloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was reached on 12th Sept., 1890. The pioneers were then disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims.

The police force alluded to above, which at one time, owing to political troubles, had to be increased to 650 men, has now been disbanded, only 40 men and a few natives being retained to act as a civil force. In its place a volunteer force of 500 men, 300 of whom could be mounted at short notice, has been formed. Further, every able-bodied man is liable to serve in the defence of the country, so that, if required, a total force of about 1,500 men, mostly old trained soldiers and volunteers, is available. Forts have been established along the road for the protection of settlers and of the convoys of supplies, and are well-supplied with machine-guns. A regular postal service has been established, and Mashonaland has recently been admitted into the Postal Union. An accelerated mail-cart service, taking passengers now covers the distance between Salisbury and Tuli in 12 days, placing London within less than 8 weeks' communication with Salisbury. A Company has been formed to construct a railway between Beira, on the east coast, and Mashonaland. Several miles of rails have already been laid, and the first section of 75 miles through the "tsetse-fly belt" will shortly be opened for traffic. This railway will place Salisbury within 6 weeks of London, and will reduce the cost of transporting machinery and supplies to a figure below that at which the chief mining centres of the Transvaal are now served.

Regular gold-workings were not commenced until July, 1891. Since that date 5 distinct gold-fields, viz., "Harley Hill (Umfuli)," "Maze," "Lo Maghondas," "Manica," and "Victoria," have been opened up, and are being actively developed. Upwards of 15,500 mining-claims have been registered, of which the holders of 2,000 have partially tested their reefs by shafts and cross-cuts. Reefs have in some cases been proved by shafts and drives at depths of over 200 feet, at which levels they are generally found to be richer and more solid than near the surface; 400 miles of gold-bearing formation have already been located, and with the advent of the railway and the consequent reasonable cost of transport, a very great expansion of the gold-industry is anticipated.
addition to gold, other minerals have been found, and several claims have been pegged off on reefs showing silver, copper, blend, tin, antimony, arsenic, and lead, while deposits of nitrate of potassium and plumbago have also been discovered.

Townships have been surveyed and marked out at Salisbury, Victoria, Umtali, and Hartley Hill. Stands have been sold at the first three places, the amount realized being nearly £10,000. Deputations sent into Mashonaland by Transvaal, Orange Free State, and Cape Colony farmers have reported in very favourable terms on the agricultural prospects of Mashonaland. A "trek" of farmers from the Orange Free State has already entered the country, and others are being organised, and a large number of farms have been allotted under the Company's land laws. The white population is estimated at about 3,000.

Printed newspapers are published at Salisbury and Victoria. Hotels are to be found at frequent intervals along the main roads from Tuli to Salisbury, and from there to Umtali, while at Salisbury itself there are several substantial buildings of brick and iron, offering excellent accommodation. A branch of the Standard Bank has been opened at Salisbury, a Sanitary Board established, churches built, hospitals erected, and, generally speaking, order and good government throughout the country has been provided for.

The Company has from time to time equipped and despatched expeditions into various parts of Central Africa, as the result of which it has secured mining and administrative concessions from many chiefs. The capital of the Company is 1,000,000l., nearly the whole of which is represented by cash subscriptions. The Company is already in receipt of revenue from mining, trading, and professional licences, stand holdings, and postal and telegraph services.

In July last the Matabelo made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's Police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters by the High Commissioner, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's Police and a large force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Buluwayo from the north and east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's force near Buluwayo, in which the Matabelo suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland Police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lobengula fled, and Buluwayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Changani, and Major Wilson with a small party of men were after a heroic resistance killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country are now being discussed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from smallpox or fever.

BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA.*

The boundaries of this territory, as defined by the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement, are a line starting from the eastern shore of Lake Nyasa at the point of the parallel of the confluence of the Rivers Rovuma and M'Sinje, and following the shore southwards as far as 13° 30' S. lat., whence it runs S.E. to the eastern shore of Lake Chiuta, which it follows; thence in a direct line to the eastern shore of Lake Chilwa, or Shirwa, which it follows to its south-easternmost point; thence in a direct line to the easternmost affluent of the River Ruo, and thence along that affluent, and subsequently the centre of the channel of the Ruo to its confluence with the River Shiré.

From the confluence of the Ruo and Shiré the boundary follows the centre of the channel of the latter river to a point just below Chiwanga, and thence due west to the watershed between the Zambezi and the Shiré, and follows the watershed between those rivers, and afterwards between the former river and Lake Nyassa, until it reaches south latitude 14°.

From thence it runs south-west to the point where south latitude 15° meets the River Aroangwa or Loangwa, and follows the mid-channel of that river to its junction with the Zambezi.

On the west the line follows the centre of the channel of the Upper Zambezi, starting from the Katima rapids up to the point where it reaches the territory of the Barute Kingdom. That territory to remain within the British sphere, and its limits to the westward, which will constitute the boundary between the British and Portuguese spheres of influence, are to be decided by a joint Anglo-Portuguese Commission.

In the early part of 1891 Her Majesty's Government extended the field of operations of the Company's Charter so as to include the whole of the British sphere north of the Zambezi, except Nyasaland, under which name are included certain districts in the Lake Nyasa region, where British missionaries had been settled for over 15 years, and the African Lakes Company had been at work for the same period, and which in 1889 were declared to be within the British sphere of influence. On 14th May, 1891, the Nyasaland districts were proclaimed as being under the protectorate of Great Britain, their boundaries being thus defined:

On the east and south by the Portuguese dominions, and to the west by a frontier starting on the south from the point where the boundary of the Portuguese dominions is intersected by the boundary of the Conventional Free Trade Zone, defined in the first article of the Berlin Conference Act, following that line northwards to the point where it meets the line of the geographical Congo basin, defined in the same article, and thence along the latter line to the point where it touches the boundary between the British and German spheres defined in the 2nd paragraph of the 1st article of the agreement of the 1st July, 1890.

British Central Africa is divided into the British Central Africa Protectorate, representing the country formerly known as Nyasaland, and the British Sphere of Influence beyond. The first named is administered by the Imperial Commissioner under the Charter of the British South Africa Chartered Company, but to all intents and purposes, however, the administration of the whole of British Central Africa is one, all the officials holding office under the Commissioner, while in addition those who exercise Magisterial duties hold a commission signed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. A proportion of the expenses of administering the Protectorate are borne by the Imperial Govern-

ment; the British South Africa Chartered Company, however, contributes a large subsidy towards the administration, varying according to the annual requirement. For the year 1891, it was 15,000l.; for the year 1892, 10,000l.; for the year 1893, 17,000l., together with an extra grant for special purposes of 10,000l. (making therefore for the year 1893-94 27,500l.). The Company is also liable for a further grant of 5,000l. a year when it should become opportune to undertake the administration of the Barutse country.

The Commissioner and Consul-General and Mr. Alfred Sharpe, as Vice-Consul and Deputy Commr., are wholly paid by the Foreign Office.

The Imperial Government maintains a naval force on the River Zambesi, River Shiré, and on Lake Nyasa, consisting of five gunboats, H.M. ships "Herald," "Mosquito," "Dove," "Adventure," and "Pioneer." There are naval stations at Tshinde (the only navigable mouth of the Zambesi); at Tshirome (River Shiré); at Mpibhi (Upper Shiré); at Fort Johnston and at Fort Maguire (at the entrance to the Shiré and on the south coast of Lake Nyasa). At Tshinde is a small plot of land, known as the "British Concession," specially granted by the Portuguese Government, where all goods in transit for British Central Africa are allowed to be transhipped free of customs duty.

The armed force necessary to maintain order within the Protectorate and the sphere of influence beyond, and to check the slave trade, consists of a corps of 200 Sikhs, seconded from active service in the Indian Army, and allowed to serve in British Central Africa for two years (being relieved by fresh arrivals at the end of that period of service), and also of 200 to 300 black police, consisting of Makua recruited by permission of the Portuguese Government from the vicinity of Mozambique. This force is officered by English officers and Sikh non-commissioned officers. There is also a good armament of artillery and mountain guns supplied by the Imperial Government.

Communications are maintained between British Central Africa and the sea (the chief "port" being Tshirome at the junction of the Rivers Luo and Shiré) by H.M. gunboats, and by the river steamers of the African Lakes Company, Sharper's Zambesi Traffic Company, the African International Flotilla Company, and the British Central Africa administration. These vessels meet at Tshinde with the ocean-going steamers of the Rennie Aberdeen line (London to Natal and Tshinde), the German East Africa Steamship Company (whose steamers connect Tshinde with Mozambique, Zanzibar, Southampton, and Bombay), and the Portuguese Royal Mail service, and of the Union Steamship Company.

The chief town of British Central Africa is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there is a population of about 35 Europeans and 4,000 natives. Other towns and settlements are:—Zomba (the headquarters of the administration), Tshirome, Katunga, Tshikwawa, Mpibhi, Port Lister, Fort Anderson, and Domasi, all more or less in the Shiré Highlands, or on the River Shiré. Fort Johnston, Fort Maguire, Livingstonia, Bandawe, Likoma, Deep Bay, and Karonga, are on Lake Nyasa; and Fife, Abercorn, Niamkolo, in the Taunganyika District; and Rhodesia and Kalungwisi on Lake Mweru. A new station is also in process of formation at Johnston Falls on the Upper Luapula River, near Bangweulo. The Mission settlements on the Shiré Highlands and on Lake Nyasa have schools attached to them.

The chief colonies of Europeans are to be met with at these settlements; the total number of Europeans at present settled in British Central Africa being 237, of whom about 210 are British subjects. In the lower part of British Central Africa a few Indian traders have already begun to establish themselves. There are also about 26 Arabs settled on or near Lake Nyasa and Taunganyika, and dwelling there as chiefs recognised by the British Government or as merchants of good repute. The native population of the whole of British Central Africa is about 4,000,000, but large portions are devoid of a single human inhabitant owing to the fearful devastation caused in the past by the slave raids of the Arabs and black Portuguese. In fact it may be said that the native population, with the exception of the Barutse country (which is thickly populated), is chiefly congregated in that portion of the territory which is more or less under British administration.

The Shiré Province, which is that portion of the Protectorate lying between the south-west, south, and south-east shores of Lake Nyasa and the Zambesi, is now governed very much on the lines of a Crown colony. Good roads are being made in all directions, life and property are safe, and the bulk of the European population is congregated here. This province is remarkable for the extraordinary development of coffee planting which has taken place within the last few years, the coffee grown in the Shiré Highlands being of remarkable excellence. The chief trade on Lake Nyasa is in ivory. Elephants are still very abundant over all British Central Africa, which furnishes probably a fourth of the ivory exported from Africa, though a good deal of it passes into the Portuguese possessions on the Zambesi, the Congo Free State, or German East Africa. Other articles of export are india-rubber, oil seeds, rhinoceros horns, hippopotamus teeth, strophanthus seed, bees wax, and rice. The latter article is grown on the shores of Lake Nyasa in great perfection; the Administration has recently introduced the cultivation of wheat, which promises to be very successful. It has also introduced oats and barley, which thrive remarkably on the uplands, and has also made experiments with merino sheep and Natal ponies, both of which kinds of stock seem likely to prosper on the elevated plateau.

The climate on the whole is healthier than the greater part of tropical Africa, but cannot be called salubrious for Europeans in general, chiefly owing to the great discomforts which at present attend a settler's life in an undeveloped country. A good deal of the sickness seems to arise from the malaria caused by tilling the soil for the first time, and the health records show that as the country becomes opened up it proves much healthier for Europeans than in its virgin state. Curiously enough, most of the complaints arise from cold and not from heat, which is nowhere very excessive, except on one or two days in the height of the summer. On the elevated plateaus and mountain ranges, which represent so large a proportion of the territory, the climate is chilly, especially during the winter months, and fires are burned nearly all the year round in the Europeans' houses.

The attention of capitalists is being directed to the great possibilities of trade on the Zambesi and the waterways connecting it with the lakes.

The total area of the sphere, actual and prospective, of the British South Africa Company...
south and north of the Zambezi exceeds 500,000 square miles.

NORTH BORNEO.*

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "the State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with all the islands within a distance of three leagues, including those of Banguey and Balembangan; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 30,709 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 8° 50' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan (where are also the headquarters of the administration), and Silam on the east, Kudat on the north, Gaya on the west and Mempakol (in Brunei Bay). At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. Inland stations are at Penungh, Papar, and Padas.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, &c.

The mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully investigated. Gold has been found in two of the rivers on the east coast; coal, copper, and other minerals have also been met with, but so far have not been worked.

The country is mountainous, although the shore is flat and fringed with mangrove. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 13,698 feet.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 200,000, are mainly Malays, Bajows, Dusuns, Sulus and Dyaks, who remove their villages periodically, and live by hunting and plunder, with occasional attempts at planting and trade. There are Malay and Chinese settlements on the coasts, which cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. Sandakan, the chief town, has a population of 7,000. There are two missions, one the Church of England and one Roman Catholic; the former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and the Church of England Community has a church and school at Sandakan, with a branch at Kudat. The club, hotel, banks and insurance agencies, European and Chinese stores, public markets, hospital, Government house, offices, gaol, barracks, saw mills, tennis grounds and the numerous neat suburban bungalows around bespeak civilization and progress.

On the west coast Kudat has also its hotel or rest house, with agencies, stores, shops and bungalows, which supply all the wants of the mixed community.

History.

The state and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sudakana in 1608, and soon abandoned. An English settlement was made in 1609, and abandoned 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762 at the island of Balembangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a
settlement on the former island, and on its failure, the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1840, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded the same district to Mr. Alfred Dent, who transferred it to the British North Borneo Company, and some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the Territory by agreement with "the State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 93°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is about 120 inches, chiefly from November to February.

Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. The chief products are tobacco, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, and pineapple fibre. There is still a large trade in the collection of jungle produce; but during the past year much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco. The soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited for its growth; about 1,000,000 acres have been leased on 999 years leases, or applied for, chiefly for this purpose, and 17 estates are in full operation. The rapid development of this industry is shown by the following figures as to exports of tobacco since 1886—1886, 72,688 lbs.; 1887, 30,800 lbs.; 1888, 81,664 lbs.; 1889, 168,112 lbs., 1890, 408,275 lbs.; for 1891, 1,635,744 lbs.; and for 1892, 1,794,720 lbs.

The exports comprise also, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, pine-apple fibre, gutta percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), gold, cutch, &c., sent almost entirely to Singapore, China, and Australia; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

A timber trade has been opened with both Australia and China.

The Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import duties, stamps, and royalties on the various exports, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites. Besides the tobacco estates already mentioned four general plantations have been opened by Europeans, especially the Dutch, and the demand for land has been so great as to cause the price to be raised during 1889 from $3 to $6 per acre. Pepper and sago are exported from the West Coast. At the end of 1889 four timber companies were engaged in the timber trade, and two saw mill companies are at work carrying on a large export trade with England, China, Manilla, and other ports.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $180,000. American, Mexican, Straits Settlements and Hong Kong dollars are treated as currency. There are agencies of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, and the National Bank of China, and the Company itself does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, and Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a court of directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor, Treasurer-General, and Residents appointed by them. There are 9 provinces (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, and Myburgh).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British colonies, and an Enaum's court, for the administration of Mahommedan law. There is a force of about 300 armed police under European officers. An European medical officer is attached to each residency.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Holt run steamers constantly between Singapore and the local ports, and between Hong Kong and the ports. There is frequent communication by steamer with Singapore and Hong Kong, and occasionally visits are made by steamers running between Hong Kong and Australia. There are no railways or telegraphs, and but few roads. Internal communication is mainly by water. The nearest point in telegraphic connection with Europe is Singapore. The State has joined the postal union. Course of post from London about thirty days. Postage from Sandakan to all places outside the territory, for letters 6 cents per ½ oz.

The postal business has considerably increased during the last few years. Statistics for 1889-91 are as follows:
