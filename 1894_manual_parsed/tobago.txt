TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641, James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole Island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from
Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a Company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce, but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Boullieu, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British Force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803, by Commander Hood and General Greenfield; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago becomes part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st Jan., 1889.

Situation and Area.

It is the most southerly of the Windward group of the British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9', W. long. 60° 12'; distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 20 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco, a port of Trinidad by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 18½ miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7¾ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,313 acres, of which about 10,000 acres is under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

General Description.

Sugar, rum, molasses, cocoanuts, and live stock form the principal articles of export. The crop of sugar in 1890 was 22,582 cwts.; the average of the previous five years being 40,398 cwts. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population in 1891 of 919. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacolet Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who maintain 20 schools with about 2,300 scholars, assisted by a Government grant of 500l.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago has been amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island is administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the united Colony, who is ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner is assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remain distinct, but there is entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad are with some specified exceptions, the law of both.

### TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

#### Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is 169 square miles, about the size of Rutland. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 6½ miles long and 2 miles broad. It contains 1,883 inhabitants, being three-eighths the total population. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

#### History.

Grand Turk claims, like so many other islands, to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by saltrakers from Bermudas. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1739 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

#### Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered being about 2 million bushels. The export of salt in 1892 was valued at 26,113l., the quantity being 1,788,334 bushels. Sponges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There is one sponge curing establishment on the Caicos Islands. The cultivation of the Sisal fibre (or Pita plant) is being extensively introduced, with every prospect of success. Cave earth is also an article of export.

An agricultural settlement was started under Government auspices at Kew, North Caicos in 1882, to grow fruit for export, but has proved a failure, owing to the absence of any remunerative market for the produce. The soil elsewhere is totally unfit for agricultural purposes. Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. The commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had on the
31st December, 1892, 42 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 5,665 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the strong and never failing sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 82°, the extreme range being from 65° to 92°. The rainfall during 1892 amounted to 20 inches, the rainy season being from October to February. Hurricanes occasionally visit the groups.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Pickford and Black's steamers, running under Government contract, leave Halifax for Jamaica on the 15th of every month, calling at Turks Islands both going and returning. The length of voyage between England and Turks is fourteen days via New York, and eighteen days via Halifax or Jamaica.

The Clyde Line from New York to Hayti calls at Grand Turk every three weeks, the length of passage being six days. There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony.

The estimated number of letters to the United Kingdom is 1,500, and to all other countries 10,000 per annum.

The rate of letter postage is 2½d. per half ounce. There is no internal post.

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti, distant 165 miles.

Education.

There are seven elementary schools supported by Government, with an attendance in 1892 of 729 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free. A compulsory education ordinance, providing also for the payment of fees, was passed in 1883, but the compulsory clauses have never been proclaimed.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, Spanish Mexican, and Columbian gold doubloons, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is no paper currency. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government saving bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1892, 98 depositors, with £411. deposit.

Constitution.

The legislature consists of a Legislative Board consisting of the Chief Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure, and all local matters, are regulated by this Board, but certain laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica relating to currency, divorce, and civil appeals which were in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands, still take effect there.
