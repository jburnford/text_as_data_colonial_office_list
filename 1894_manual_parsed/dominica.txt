DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 20' and 15° 45' N. lat., and 61° 13' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad; very mountainous and picturesque; was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd November, 1493, on his second voyage. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, and has an area of 291 square miles.

This island was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Carribean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of 312,092l. 11s. 1d. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising, also Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771 the island was constituted a separate Government.

In 1771, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military
and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor; trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prevost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts.

Serious riots occurred in 1893 in connexion with the collection of taxes in the interior of the Island. The police and marines were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results.

In consequence, an inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who left for Dominica in November last.

Sugar, cocoa, and lime-juice are the chief products, but some fruit, coffee, spice, oils, and timber are also exported from the island. The principal exports in 1891 were: coffee and cocoa, 433,996 lbs. Sugar, 2,215 hogsheads. Lime-juice, value £2,215l. The island abounds in rivers and rivulets, well stocked with fish. The rainfall for 1892 was 117 inches.

The chief town is Roseau, population about 4,500; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1892, four vessels, of a total tonnage of 48. These are mostly engaged in coasting trade.

The Local Government is administered by a President, aided by an Executive Council of seven members. In 1865 the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members, to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The president presides over the deliberations of this body, and exercises a casting vote in the House, and a deliberative as well as a casting vote in Committee.

Electors for a parish must possess land or houses to be rented at £1 per annum, or be an occupier of premises worth £1 per annum, or have an income of £2l., or pay taxes of 15s. per annum.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants speak a French patois.
