DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, were by the Imperial Act 30–31 Vic., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 27th of May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vic., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16 May, 1871, issued under the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that colony was incorporated in
the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieut.-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba), were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieut.-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada, from the 1st of Sept., 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1534 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the Queen, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of government, until the Queen shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 80 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces and by the increase in population, and after the next general election will be 218; 92 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 20 Nova Scotia, 14 New Brunswick, 7 Manitoba, 6 British Columbia, 5 Prince Edward Island, and 4 The Territories. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $1,000 per annum, and each member of the Commons $10 a day during the session, with a maximum of $1,000 per session. A parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot, with a franchise almost equal to manhood suffrage. The session usually extends from February to May.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials who possess the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The provincial legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. There is a legislative assembly in the North-West Territories, consisting of 26 elected members. Four members possessing the confidence of the majority in the Council are selected by the lieutenant-governor to form with him an advisory council on matters of finance. The territory not comprised within any province (such as the North-East Territory, the Arctic Islands, and the Island of Anticosti) is very thinly inhabited, and is administered by the Minister of the Interior at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the provincial legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the provincial legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the Probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, according to the census of 1861, except that the subsidy of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Manitoba is to
increase each census till the population in each case reach 400,000. Each Province also receives an annual allowance for Government, and for interest on the amount by which its debt at the Union fell short of the authorised amount.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislatures require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the Queen.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have now been opened.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In Ontario the system is to be found in the most complete and symmetrical form, towards which the others closely approximate. The organization comprises (1) townships or rural districts of 8 or 10 square miles with a population of 3 to 6,000, administered by a reeve and 4 councillors; (2) villages with a population of 750, governed like the township; (3) towns with a population over 2,000, governed by the mayor and 3 councillors for each ward if there are less than five wards, and 2 councillors if more than five. The Reeves, deputy Reeves, mayors, and councillors are all elected annually by the ratepayers. Above these stands the county municipality consisting of the Reeves and deputy Reeves of the townships, villages, and towns within the county, one of these who presides being called "Warden" of the county. Alongside the county stands the "city" with a population of over 10,000, governed by a municipal body of mayor and 3 aldermen for every ward, with powers and functions akin to those of counties and towns combined. The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except Labrador, see page 166, and Alaska, which belongs to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,315,647 square miles (29 times the area of the United Kingdom, or 4 times that of British India), exclusive of the great lakes and rivers which cover about 141,000 square miles. The greater part of this is comprised in the North West Territories. The seven settled Provinces of the Dominion comprise about 955,556 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

A census of the three provisional districts of The Territories, viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, was taken in 1885, showing a population of 48,362, of whom 20,170 were Indians. A census of Manitoba was taken in 1886, and the population found to be 108,640.

About 1,400,000 of the people are of French extraction, over one million two hundred thousand of these residing in Quebec, where French is the usual language spoken.

The total population includes about 110,000 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories, and there are about 14,000 half breeds. They are under the supervision of government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs. There are over 9,000 Chinese in Canada, most of whom are in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

### Industry

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Coal and gold (in British Columbia and Nova Scotia), and copper (principally in Ontario) are extensively worked. Valuable nickel and phosphate mines exist. Shipbuilding is an important industry, and besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments. The principal imports are textile manufactures, coal, hardware, tea, sugar, raw cotton, hides, and tobacco.

The yield of Canadian fisheries since 1886 was as follows:

| Year | Yield |
|------|-------|
| 1886 | 18,679,288 |
| 1887 | 18,233,373 |
| 1888 | 17,418,510 |
| 1889 | 17,655,256 |
| 1890 | 17,714,902 |
| 1891 | 18,978,078 |
| 1892 | 18,941,171 |

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is estimated at 65,000.

Tonnage of vessels on Register Books of the Dominion, 31st December, 1892, was 964,129 tons register, of which 5,505 sailing ships were 729,418 tons, and 1,502 steamers 234,711; total, 964,129 tons. The number of seamen employed was about 140,000.

### Railways

The length of railways actually constructed in the Dominion on 30th June, 1892, was 14,870 miles, with 14,588 miles in operation. Canada ranks eighth in absolute mileage among the states and kingdoms of the world possessing railway systems. The total capital invested amounted to $844,991,750 on 30th June, 1892. The total quantity of goods carried amounted to 21,189,923 tons. The number of passengers was 13,222,568, and the distance travelled by trains was 44,484,468 miles. The total receipts were $51,685,768, and working expenses $36,488,228.

The Dominion Government own and maintain 1,398 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $57,700,015. The working expenses in 1892 were $3,748,597, and the receipts $3,136,394.

In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, via Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and a monthly mail service between Vancouver and Hong Kong, via Yokohama which has been subsidised by the Imperial and Dominion Government to the extent of $300,000 has been established.

### Telegraphs

There are 30,987 miles of telegraph line, and 66,925 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 2,039 are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 4,464,944 messages were sent in 1891 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 2,657, being one to every 1,819 of the population. Canada ranks eighth in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States.
telephone is in operation in all parts of the country, and in connection with it there are in Ontario and Quebec 6,200 miles of poles; 32,214 miles of wire; 26,651 sets of instruments; and 65,183,120 connections.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. The total length of canals proper open is 262½ miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,884 miles. The receipts in 1892 were $346,686, and the working expenses, including repairs, $589,280. Over fifty-eight million dollars have been expended on the construction of these canals; not including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which will be opened in the season of 1894, costing about three million dollars.

Currency and Banking.

There is a uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills., $4.86¢ being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

There are Government savings banks in three provinces, having about 56,000 depositors. There are also Post Office savings banks in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and North-West Territories, and British Columbia, having 111,230 depositors.

The total amount of savings bank deposits, including two operating under special charters, was $54,103,575 on 30th June, 1893.

In the same month, the banks had a note circulation of $33,483,413. In 1877 they held $69,763,668 of deposits, and on 30th June, 1893, they held $170,817,438. In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and on 31st December, 1890, had notes in circulation amounting to $15,657,391, and on 30th June, 1893, $18,448,494. The maximum Government issue is fixed at twenty million dollars, and the minimum reserve in specie and British Government securities is fixed at 25 per cent. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government.

Post Office.

The number of letters sent in Canada in the year ended 30th June, 1892, was 102,850,000, of postcards 20,815,000, and of newspapers (other than those sent from the office of publication, which are all carried free), periodicals, parcels, &c., 36,656,000. The number of newspapers sent from the office of publication was about 64,000,000. The number of letters per head of population was 20.57. The number of offices was 8,288. The revenue for 1892 was $3,642,611, and the expenditure $4,205,985.

There is weekly mail communication with Great Britain, via Quebec or Halifax, fortnightly with the West Indies and Demerara, and four a week via New York. There is a through daily service by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Pacific coast, a monthly direct steam service with Australia, and a bi-monthly steam service with Japan and China.

| Australasia | 5 1 " |
| Ditto via Brindisi | 5 1 " |

There is a parcels post to Newfoundland, West Indies, Australia, Europe, and Japan.

Defence.

There is an imperial naval station at Halifax N.S., which is strongly fortified, and defended by a garrison of 1,500 men. The defence of the Dominion rests, however, with the local forces. The Canadian Militia since confederation has, in accordance with the Canadian Militia Act, been under the immediate command of a Major-General of the English Army. The Dominion is divided, for military purposes, into twelve districts, with a Deputy Adjutant-General, and a Brigade Staff in charge of each. The active Militia numbers 35,000 men, and the reserve Militia consists of all adult males between 18 and 60 (with certain exceptions) who are not serving in the active Militia. There are included in this force 34 batteries of garrison artillery, and 17 of field artillery, and 44 troops of cavalry.

II. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada is said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497; but this is not certain. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonization were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by one Kirk, but was retro-ceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-Laye.

From 1763 to 1774, Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were allowed the free exercise of their religion: the Catholic Clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), dividing Canada into two Provinces, upper Canada (now Ontario) and lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1838. The most fruitful causes of dissension were the right of the Assembly to control public expenditure, and the question of the "Clergy Reserves," lands appropriated by the Imperial Act of 1791 for the exclusive benefit of the Anglican Clergy. The immediate exciting cause of the Rebellion was the establishing, by Governor Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton) of 37 rectories in Upper Canada. After the reduction of the insurgents, the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 and 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. The new House of Assembly consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. In the same year (1840) also, Municipal Institutions were established in Canada.

The Provincial Legislature was empowered by Act 17 & 18 Vic., cap. 118 (1854), to constitute the Legislative Council an elective body.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1855 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "dead lock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."
Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in council, advised by five or more cabinet ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 92 members; Quebec 65 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $6 per day for 30 days or a maximum of $800. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in council. The members are paid $6 per day while the session lasts, and their travelling expenses.

Industry.

The land in both Ontario and Quebec is very fertile, and produces all cereals and wheat crops in abundance; fruit grows luxuriantly; and grapes, melons, peaches and tomatoes come to maturity in the open air. The cattle and meat trade is also assuming considerable proportions, large exports of this kind being shipped annually to England. In 1890 Canada ranked second in the list of countries shipping live cattle to Great Britain. The same remark applies to dairy produce.

The lumber trade is extensive; and manufactures of hardware and textile fabrics are largely carried on.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for both the elementary (public) and high schools, of which there are 5,601, with 494,287 scholars in 1891. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational), university (Toronto) with an affiliated university college, and three theological colleges are also affiliated, and one university is confederated. There are also five denominational colleges with university powers in the province, and numerous high schools or colleges for girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were in 1890, 4,520 schools, with 168,616 scholars. There are about 600 high and superior schools, with about 73,000 pupils, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

Besides those mentioned at p. 54, the chief towns are, in Ontario, Belleville, Chatham, Peterboro, Woodstock, and Stratford; and in Quebec, Trois Rivières, Levis, with from 8,000 to 10,000 inhabitants each.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the last census was 450,523.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander by James I. in 1627. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of the province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

The harbour of Halifax has an area of about 10 square miles, is open at all seasons, and its navigation is scarcely ever interrupted by ice. This harbour is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for, it is said, 1,000 ships. The British Government has an extensive dockyard at Halifax, which is its principal naval station in North America. Some of the other chief towns are Annapolis, Antigonish, Digby, Kentville, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney (in Cape Breton), Amherst, Lunenburg and Liverpool.

The climate is remarkably healthy, and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion, but fogs prevail on the coast at certain seasons. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°. The average annual rainfall is 34 inches, evenly distributed.

Coal and iron ore are plentiful, and gold also has been discovered, and is yielding fair returns; but the greater portion of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and the growth of fruit. The superior fisheries, together with the ship-building and timber trades, give occupation to many.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 21 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected every four years. The Members are paid $500 sessional indemnity.

Education.

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by the Town Council, or a committee thereof.

In 1890 there were 2,193 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 86,488 pupils. Education is compulsory, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

There is an examining university at Halifax, and five sectarian colleges.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 45° 5' and
48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 47' and 67° 53' W. long.; its area is about 27,105 square miles, or 17,000,000 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population on 5th April, 1891, was 321,294.

History.

New Brunswick, in the early part of the last
century, belonged to the French, and was called
by them New France. At the peace of 1763,
New Brunswick, with the rest of Canada, was
ceded by France to Great Britain, and was
annexed to Nova Scotia until 1785, when it was
erected into a separate Colony. It was first
colonized by British subjects in 1761, and in 1783
by disbanded troops from New England.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 40°, the
extreme range being from 11° below zero to 82°.
The average annual rainfall is 35 inches, and the
snowfall 158 inches, the latter extending from
November to April inclusive.
Industries.

Coal is abundant; antimony, iron, and gypsum are to be found also in very large quantities. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 80 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 7,000), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 46,000). Other towns are Moncton (9,000), Chatham (5,000), Woodstock (3,000), and St. Stephen (3,000).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 16 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 41 members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $300 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 5 and 20. There were 1,595 schools, with 68,909 scholars in attendance, in 1892.

There is a university at Fredericton, and several colleges.

MANITOBA AND KEEWATIN.

Situation and Area.

Manitoba was erected into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vic., c. 8, taking effect on 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-99° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°-53° N. lat. and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 60,520 square miles, with a population in 1887 of 112,000, which had grown to 154,442 in 1891.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St. Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

The district of Keewatin, the eastern boundaries of which were recently defined by the settlement of western boundaries of Ontario, comprises all the country east of the Great Mackenzie River Basin, north of Manitoba, and west of Ontario, and has a population of about 5,000 Indians and whites, was in 1876 placed under the government of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, who is empowered by the Keewatin Act, chap. 58, of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, to appoint justices of the peace and otherwise arrange for the administration of justice. Intoxicants are by this Act absolutely prohibited.

History.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, incited by disaffected persons, rose in insurrection, and established a provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection, having previously imprisoned 39 Canadians, shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871 the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid, but it was arrested by the United States Commander at Fort Pembina on the International Boundary.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence for two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of this province are very highly spoken of. The soil is a rich black loam, peculiarly adapted to the growth of wheat. A variety of "hard wheat" is grown throughout the province generally, which is very much in demand amongst millers, for the purpose of mixing with softer varieties. Coal of the lignite description and good building clay have been discovered in the Souris Valley.

The growth of Winnipeg, the chief city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants. In 1881 it had a population of about 10,000, and now has over 32,000. The other chief towns are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Minnedosa, Morden, and Emerson.

The free-grant lands are almost all taken up, but good farms can be purchased from $2 to $10 per acre.

During the three years previous to the year 1891 wheat has produced on the average almost 20 bushels per acre, oats 36-4, barley 26-7, and potatoes 175-5 throughout the province.

In the present year (1893) there are 22,000 farmers in the province, and they have 1,558,262 acres under crop, namely:

| Crop          | Acres |
|---------------|-------|
| Wheat         | 1,003,640 |
| Oats          | 388,529  |
| Barley        | 114,762  |
| Peas          | 1,059   |
| Potatoes      | 12,387  |
| Roots         | 20,919  |
| Rye and flax  | 9,737   |

Total: 1,558,262

Railway Facilities.

In the year 1879 there was no railway at all in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains.

In the year 1892 there were in the province of Manitoba alone 1,680 miles of railway, which afford easy access to market from all parts of the province.
Climate.

The mean temperature at Winnipeg in only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 inches, and snowfall (November to April), 53 inches.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 4 members in the Dominion Senate and 5 members in the House of Commons, but by the "Redistribution Act," passed at the session of the Dominion Parliament, which has just closed, Manitoba will be entitled to be represented by 6 members in the House of Commons.

The province has a Legislative Assembly of 40 members elected by manhood suffrage for 4 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber, was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876.

The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $600 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control was in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively. The local management was entrusted to school trustees elected by the people.

By the "Public Schools Act," of 1890, all the previous school Acts were repealed, and a system of national non-sectarian schools was established throughout the province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school."

In 1892 there were 660 schools in operation, employing 902 school teachers, of whom 390 were men, and 512 women.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one university, styled "The University of Manitoba," with examining and degree-conferring powers only. The affiliated Colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley and Lansdowne (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical College.

British Columbia.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast, bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, and on the south by the United States—the average
breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of coast line 550 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 383,000 square miles, and the population at the recent census was 98,173.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island, discovered in 1762, was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and six in the House of Commons, of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a lieutenant-governor and legislative assembly of 33 members on the system of executive administration known as a "Responsible Government." The assembly is elected for four years, every male adult having resided 12 months in the Province, duly registered, being entitled to vote.

Members receive $600 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

The population is about 100,000, of whom 25,000 are Indians, and 7,000 Chinese.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains: the climate is for the most part drier, and the snow fall consequently less.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; the exports amount to over six and a half million dollars annually (a remarkable fact considering the number of the population); they consist of minerals (chiefly gold and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon and oil), timber, furs, skins, &c. The imports amount to nearly six and a half million dollars, principally from Eastern Canada, England, the United States, China, &c.

The province has produced over fifty million dollars of gold, the export for 1892 being $400,000, and it is expected that the prosecution of quartz mining, now in its infancy, will, in the near future, be a most important industry.

Considerable deposits of silver have recently been discovered at Illicilliwaet in the northern part of the province.

The lumber trade is fast attaining large dimensions, the shipments during 1892 amounting to over $425,000. Timber is abundant in all parts of the province.

The chief towns are Victoria (24,000) and Nanaimo, city and neighbourhood (8,000), the seat of the coal-mining industry on Vancouver Island. On the mainland, New Westminster (9,000), and Vancouver (19,000). Esquimalt is a coaling station.

Education.

A complete system of free common school education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in a Superintendent of Education, acting under the Minister of Education, and the local management is in the hands of three trustees, elected annually by the people in each school district. Education is free and compulsory between the ages of 7 and 12 inclusive. There are 130 schools, with an enrolment of 9,260 pupils. The schools are free and non-sectarian; school districts being formed wherever there are fifteen pupils between the ages of six and sixteen.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long. Its area is about 1,380,000 acres; it is about 140 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1770.

The population at the last census was 109,088.

Description.

The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, &c.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (11,874), and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 208 miles in length, including branches.

Constitution.

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, a Legislative Council of 13 members, and a House of Assembly of 30 members. Both these bodies are elected.

Each member receives a payment of $160 per annum, and $12 for postage, besides travelling expenses.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives and four councillors to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and six in the House of Commons.

Education.

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a Chief Superintendent. Education is free, non-secretarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 444 schools, with 22,382 scholars. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above
there is also a Roman Catholic College not under the control of the Government.

Finance.

The Province has a large sum to its credit, from which it draws interest. There is no direct taxation, with the exception of statute labour on the roads, or commutation money therefor in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North Western Territory, are, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North West Territories, were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. This Act was amended and consolidated by 48 Vic., cap. 25. The territories are governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, subject to instructions given by Order in Council at Ottawa, or by the Secretary of State of Canada.

In September, 1892, the territories were divided into electoral districts, returning 26 members to the Legislative Assembly, from among whom an executive committee, consisting of 4 members is chosen to aid and advise the Lieut.-Governor in the government of the territories. The Assembly elects its own speaker. The territories have rapidly grown in wealth and importance in recent years, and immigration has been largely on the increase.

Elementary education is provided for by a Council of Public Instruction, consisting of the members...
of the Executive Committee of the Territories, and four persons appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, empowered by the School Ordinance, 1892. School districts can be organised in areas not exceeding 25 sq. miles, where there are at least four heads of families, and a population of at least ten children of school age. School districts are administered by three trustees elected by the residents, except in town municipalities, in which seven Trustees are elected. Liberal aids are given to school districts by Government. Seventy per cent. of an amount, to be calculated as follows, is paid to all teachers employed:

(a) To schools having an average attendance of from six to ten pupils, $420.00 per annum; (b) for every pupil in average daily attendance over ten pupils, an additional amount of $5.00; (c) for every pupil in daily average attendance in all standards above Standard III, an additional amount of $18.00; (d) for each teacher employed holding a second class certificate an additional $25.00, and for each teacher employed holding a first class certificate an additional amount of $50.00. The number of public schools in operation is 270, with 6,800 pupils. During the past twelve months 75 new school districts were established.

The Territories were divided in 1882 into four provisional districts; viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. Regina (the capital) is in the district of Assiniboia, and has a population of about 2,000. The boundaries of these districts are as follows:

Assiniboia, bounded on the east by Manitoba, on the north by latitude 52, on the west by longitude 110, and on the south by altitude 49 (8,953.5 sq. miles).

Saskatchewan, bounded on the south by Assiniboia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson River, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by longitude 110 (10,09.2 sq. miles).

Alberta, bounded on the south by latitude 49, on the east by Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by British Columbia (10,610.0 sq. miles).

Athabasca, bounded on the south by Alberta, on the east by longitude 110 and the Athabasca River, on the north by latitude 60, and on the west by British Columbia (10,450.0 sq. miles).

The population of these four districts in April last was 67,554, and of the rest of the territories 32,168, a total of 99,722.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply to the Territories also. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Alberta than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that the Territories have over 150,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlements.

Cape of Good Hope.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the
Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, on the northeast by the Orange Free State and Natal, and on the east by Pondoland. The Cape Colony with the Transkei contains an area of 221,311 square miles, being over four times that of England. It extends from 28 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876 three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land—were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walfish Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the colony by proclamation dated 7th Aug., 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcakelaland, of which by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed governor. By Proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Alyiff") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of —October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Basutoland, now an independent colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indianman, the "Haarlem," was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinot in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British Force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig.

An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III, c. 11) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted.

An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonization as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of 50,000l. to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonization of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:

1. General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question.
2. Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin
D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. 3. Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Nativo Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat never oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice are unknown except in the more elevated localities. The mean temperature at Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is—maximum 71°5, minimum 53°0, and average rainfall for last 9 years 30-19 inches. Aliwal N. (4380 ft. above sea), shows 73-4 and 43-6 max. and min. resp., rainfall average for 9 years 25-31 inches.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (Nov. to Apr.), in the Western districts during the winter months.

Diseases of the lungs are rare, and there is a remarkable exemption from cholera, fevers, &c.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Railways and Harbours.

The railways of the Colony consisted originally of three separate systems, the Western, Midland, and Eastern, having their starting points on the sea-board at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London respectively. The Western and Midland systems are connected by a junction at De Aar (500 miles from Capetown and 340 from Port Elizabeth) and carried forward thence as one trunk line to Kimberley, the centre of the Diamond Fields (647 miles from Capetown and 485 from Port Elizabeth). This line was opened in 1885. From Kimberley the line is now carried Northward to Vryburg in British Bechuanaland; a further northward extension, via Mafeking towards Mashonaland and Zambesi is under construction. The extension from Colesberg to Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State (140 miles), was opened for traffic to Bloemfontein in December, 1890. Since that date the line has been carried through the Free State, over the Vaal River into the Transvaal territory. The line through the Free State to the Vaal River belongs to and is worked by the Cape Government as part of their railways; from the Vaal River the Cape Government trains by virtue of a convention run through to Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Eastern system extends from East London, through Queen's Town, to Aliwal North, adjacent to the Basutoland and Orange Free State frontiers, was opened in 1885, and in February, 1892, it was extended to join the Cape Government railway within the Free State at Springfontein, so forming a direct line to Bloemfontein and Johannesburg. A branch extends to King William's Town, 42 miles from East London.

The lengths from Cape Town to Wellington, 64 miles, and from Cape Town to Wynberg, 8½ miles, became the property of the Government by purchase; the rest have been constructed, equipped, and maintained at the expense of the general revenue.

The Government mileage open for traffic in December, 1892, was 2,252 miles; the capital expended on purchase, construction, and equipment to that date being £19,321,755l. The gross receipts for 1892 were £2,248,980l., compared with £1,896,376l. in 1891; the working expenses were £1,370,904l., compared with £1,117,649l. in 1891, resulting in a return of 4l. 14s. 8d. per cent. on capital expended.

The line between Grahamstown and Port Alfred (about 49 miles), which was constructed by a company subsidised by Government, was opened for traffic in 1883. During the session of 1883 powers were given to a company, to be also aided by a subsidy, to construct a branch from Worcester, on the Western Main Line, down the Breede River Valley as far as Montagu. This line is now open past Robertson to Ashton, about 42 miles.

The Cape Copper Mining Company own and work a mineral line from Port Nolloth to Ookiep (92 miles) in the north-western part of the Colony, built at a cost of £158,000. In September, 1892, a line of railway 3¼ miles long was opened for passenger traffic between Cape Town and Sea Point; it belongs to a private company. In the same year a private line of 7 miles in length was opened, connecting the Zwartkop Salt Pan with the Midland (Government) Railway System. Total railways open, 2,440 miles.

Harbour works on an extensive scale are being constructed at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London.

At Cape Town and Port Elizabeth the works are under the direction of local boards, composed of elective and nominee members. At Port Alfred and East London they are at present controlled by the Public Works Department of the Government. East London will shortly be placed under the control of a Board, constituted as in the other cases of nominee and elected members.

The cost of the works at Table Bay, to the 31st December, 1892, was for the breakwater, docks, &c., £1,871,488l.

The breakwater is now carried out to a length of 3,640 feet. The graving dock was opened for use in 1882. Its length is 539½ feet, and it is capable of taking vessels of the largest class likely to visit these waters. It is constructed throughout of colonial granite.

Extensive additions to the shipping accommodation have been authorised, and are in course of construction, comprising an outer harbour, formed in part by the existing breakwater, and its extension, and a south arm running parallel with it, which will enclose an area of 64 acres, in addition to the inner docks, or a total area,
when the works are completed, of about 75 acres, with a depth ranging from 24 to 36 feet at low water.

The works constructed at Port Elizabeth were two iron pile jetties, each nearly 900 feet long, which have much facilitated the landing and shipping of passengers and goods; an iron bridge over the Baakens River, and two retaining banks, and the removal of the old wooden jetties, and the old breakwater and shield. The total expenditure to 31st December, 1892, was £60,770. The work of extending the north jetty, at a cost of £100,000, is approaching completion.

At East London and at Port Alfred, at the mouths of the Buffalo and Kowie Rivers, the attempt made to overcome the obstructions of the sand-bars which close the entrances, by the construction of training-walls intended to have the effect of removing the bar by the natural scouring of the stream, has resulted in regard to the former in increased depth of water and general improvement. Two steam pump hopper dredgers are now employed at East London, with highly satisfactory results in opening the entrance channel. To the 30th June, 1892, there had been expended at East London £55,008, and at Port Alfred £12,325.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin, nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William’s Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the Mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The River Diggings, which still support a population of between 3,000 and 4,000, extend along the Vaal River, principally on the right bank from above Hebron to its junction with the Hart at Delperts Hope. The Dry Mines at present worked are at Kimberley, De Beers, Du Toits Pan, and Bultfontein. St. Augustine’s Mine also figures to a small extent in the production returns.

The following tables give the total quantity and value of the production and export of Diamonds during the past five years:

| Year | Production | Exports |
|------|------------|---------|
|      | Carats     | Carats  |
| 1888 | 3,600,077  | 3,841,937 |
| 1889 | 2,778,696  | 2,961,894 |
| 1890 | 2,448,777  | 2,504,726 |
| 1891 | 2,860,308  | 2,325,546 |
| 1892 | 2,968,375  | 3,039,062 |

Minerals, &c.

Cape coal from various mines situated in the Stormberg is now extensively used upon the Eastern system of railways, with good results both as regards the working of the line, and the development of an industry likely to prove of the greatest benefit to the Colony. The use of the coal is at present confined to the Eastern system, but a junction line joining the Midland system at Middelburg Road has been constructed from a point a few miles south of Burghersdrop, with the object of providing ready access to the coal for the other systems when circumstances render possible its more extended employment. A good class of coal is procured from the Indwe mine situated in the district of Wodehouse, and small supplies have been drawn from this source at various times. The cost of transport, however, by wagon in the absence of railway connection has rendered its adoption on a large scale impossible up to the present time.

By Act of Parliament certain persons who have devoted considerable attention to the development of this mine, are authorised under specified conditions to construct the required line, receiving in exchange grants of land and money. Up to the present no definite steps have been taken beyond entering upon negotiations for financing the undertaking. The coal from both the Stormberg and the Indwe mines is used locally for domestic purposes and for mill furnaces, &c. The output from the mines during 1892 is returned at 41,717 tons.

In the neighbourhood of the Indwe, trending in a north-east direction, are considerable tracts of Crown land as yet untested, but reported by mining and geological experts to be in all probability the seat of valuable deposits of coal. It has been suggested that these beds may be connected with those found on the north-west border of Natal.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist.

The output from the mines during 1892 was 32,897 tons of ore, the quantity exported being 20,256 tons, valued at £184,178.

Guano is found in large quantities on the various islets along the coast; and the collection and exportation of it forms a very remunerative industry.

Industries.

The chief industries are the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of the Colony
is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked. Those reserved to the Crown cover an estimated area of about 250,006 acres. They are controlled by the Department of Woods and Forests, at an annual charge of some £2,000l.

The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests with anticipated satisfactory results. The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, gold, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are textiles, leather, sugar, coffee, hardware, explosives, and machinery.

The wine exported in 1892 amounted to 82,433 gallons, valued at 19,375l.

Ostrich breeding is not now carried on so largely as heretofore. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in many districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1892 it amounted to 257,102 lbs.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—385 lbs., 408,153 lbs., and 10,516,837 lbs. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871, and stood at 70,335,193 lbs. in 1892, the maximum reached.

The Agricultural Department, which was established in 1887, has, by the consent of Parliament, been placed under a separate Minister. Amongst the more important works of the past few years have been the reconstitution of the phylloxerised vineyards by means of the French American resistant stocks, the improvement in the Hackney breed of horses, the establishment of a Bacteriological Laboratory for investigating diseases of animals, and for ensuring the supply of calf lymph for purposes of vaccination, the cultivation of tobacco, and the preparation of raisins and fresh and dried fruits for export purposes. Attempts are being made to acclimatise European trout, and the department is also charged with the administration of the Scab Acts and Game Laws. There are Agricultural schools in connection with the Department at Stellenbosch and Somerset East.

Capetown, East London, and Port Elizabeth are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1892, 27 vessels registered, of together 3,855 tons.

The following return supplied by establishments producing manufactures of the value of 100l. or upwards per annum, showed the value and importance of the various industries of the colony in 1890:

| Class of Industry                  | Value of Articles produced | Number of Workers | Value of Materials used | Value of Buildings, Machinery, &c. |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Food, drinks, and stimulants      | 2,148,961                  | 3,921            | 1,588,001              | 914,248                           |

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account.

Since the beginning of 1892, the banks having their head offices outside the colony are only allowed to issue notes supplied to them by the government, which holds securities deposited by the institutions for the total supply of such notes given to the banks. The notes are legal tender and guaranteed by the government, the banks having to redeem the notes in gold on demand at their chief places of business.

Banks having their head office in the colony, and having been registered on the 1st January, 1891, can continue to issue their own notes, which are neither guaranteed nor legal tender.

There are 4 banks with 82 branches.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (58 branches), the Bank of Africa, Limited (11 branches), the African Banking Corporation, Limited (17 branches), and the Stellenbosch District Bank, Limited.

The total amount of notes in circulation on the 30th of June, 1893, was 623,921l. 10s.

Post Office savings banks were established in 1884; on 30th June, 1893, there was 1,292,229l. 5s. 9d. deposited, to the credit of 34,961 depositors. The interest allowed is 3½ per cent.

Number of branches 209.

The weights and measures in use are British; besides which there are the Morgen—2½ acres, the Cape Foot=1'03 feet, and the Cape ton =2,000 lbs.

Education.

Under the Education Act, No. 13 of 1865, and the Higher Education Act, No. 24 of 1874, the department administers parliamentary grants to colleges, and the following classes of schools: Undenominational public, district boarding, private farm, circuit, art, mission and Aborigines', for the following purposes: Part payment of salaries, purchase of buildings, furniture, apparatus, and books; training of teachers; support of indigent boarders.

Schools are managed and teachers appointed, subject to the control of the department, by local committees or managers nominated by the voluntary promoters and supporters of the schools, or by divisional or municipal councils acting as such managers.

The Government grants are, generally speaking, given to supplement local contributions of at least
equal amount. There is no school tax, the necessary grants being provided from the general revenue. The department further undertakes the periodical inspection of schools, collects and publishes educational statistics, and issues certificates of professional competency to teachers.

The Government expenditure on schools in 1891-92 was £33,930. 3s. 6d.

On the 31st of March, 1893, there were in operation five colleges with 376 students, 1,743 schools of various classes with an attendance of 67,736.

The University.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

The Council consists of 20 members. The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowments, &c.

In 1891, the number of students who matriculated was 142, 35 passed the intermediate examination in arts, and 16 took direct degrees. In 1892, the numbers were 207, 40 and 19 respectively.

In connection with the University, school examinations are held annually. 7,977 candidates have passed the elementary, and 1,594 the higher examinations since 1875, the date of their institution.

In 1892 the number of students who matriculated was 207, 40 passed the intermediate examination in arts, and 19 took direct degrees. In 1893 the numbers were 214, 40 and 24 respectively.

In connection with the university, school examinations are held annually. 9,263 candidates have passed the elementary, and 2,036 the higher examinations since 1875, the date of their institution.

Sea and Land Communications.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Capetown, by the Western cable, and via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable. The telegraph system is well developed, there being now 13,767 miles of telegraph wire, and 307 miles of telephone wire open, erected by the Government at a cost of £419,659l.; the gross earnings in 1892 being £151,119l., and the expenditure £75,878l.

The packets of the Union Steam Ship Company and the Castle Mail Packets Company, under contracts with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 19 days, and in 19½ days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena. The average passage is under 19 days. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. Up to the 20th June, 1891, the mail packets called at Lisbon on outward voyages to take up the supplementary English and the Continental mails; but after that date it was arranged that they should call at Madeira only on the direct outward voyage, the Lisbon service as well as the St. Helena-Ascension service being performed by the intermediate steamers of the two companies. The mail packets call at Madeira on the homeward voyages.

Steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal calling at Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and East London, to land and embark passengers; those of the Union line usually leave about 24 hours after the arrival of the English mail.

A "limited mail train" is despatched from Cape Town conveying mails and passengers to all parts of the Colony, about five or six hours after the arrival of the English mail steamer, the mails for the Transvaal, Orange Free State, and Bechuanaland being despatched only at 9 p.m. daily by train, and the Natal mails when received by the "Castle" Company's ships are sent overland by this train or the limited mail trains to connect with a steamer at Port Elizabeth, or East London.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A "Castle" Company's steamer leaves Natal once a fortnight for Delagoa Bay, and every six weeks for Mauritius and Madagascar. The "Union" Company extend their Natal service to Delagoa Bay once every fortnight, and to East Coast ports as far as Zanzibar every four weeks.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily; with Natal three times a week, via the Orange Free State; with the Orange Free State daily, and with the Transvaal daily by rail through the Orange Free State. The latter is the direct route to the Transvaal, and the journey from Cape Town is performed in less than three days.

Transit between England and Johannesburg and Pretoria by this route is, therefore, under 22 days.

The number of Colonial post offices is 739, and of money order offices 210. The expenditure on the postal service amounted to £195,918l. in 1892; the revenue was £175,704l., and the commission on money orders £10,121l.

Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1891 the total population of the Colony was found to be 1,527,224, comprising 767,327 males, and 759,897 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 376,987; Malays, 13,907; Hottentots, 50,588; Fingoes, 229,680; Kaffirs, 608,456; and other coloured persons, 247,806.

Cape Town, which had in 1875 a population of 33,239, had at the census a population of 51,251, and with its suburbs, connected by rail and tramway, 83,898, as compared with 50,259 in 1875. The Cape division, which includes Cape Town, had in 1865, a population of 50,064; in 1875, 57,319; and in 1891, 97,283, of which 48,544 were European and white.

The population of the other principal towns was:

Kimberley, 28,718; Port Elizabeth, 23,266; Beaconfield, 10,498; Grahamstown, 10,498; Paarl, 7,668; King Williams Town, 7,226; East London, 6,924; Graaff Reinet, 5,946; Worcester 5,404; Uitenhage, 5,331; Cradock, 4,389; Oudtshoorn, 4,386; Queenstown, 4,094; Stellenbosch, 3,462; and Somerset East, 2,894.

The following is a brief abstract of the 1891 census returns:

The number of persons of European descent has been estimated as follows:—Dutch and French origin, 230,000; English, Scotch, Irish, &c., 130,000; other Europeans, 16,000.

The European, or white, then, represents one-quarter, and the coloured races three quarters of the total population of the whole colony, whereof one-fifth is urban. The proportion of females is now 99·03 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 6·90. The number of inhabited dwellings
was 276,607, of which 522 were not intended for dwelling houses, though used as such.

Birthplaces.—1,472,996 persons had Africa for a birthplace, 49,840 Europe, 2,344 Asia, 988 America, 390 Australasia, 155 were born at sea, and the birthplaces of 502 were unknown or unspecified. About 98-12 per cent. of the population are British subjects.

Religions.—Protestants numbered 782,047; Catholics, 17,275; Jews, 3,009; Mohammedans, 15,099; other sects, 1,894; no denomination, 638; no religion, 753,824; unspecified, 8,277; and 661 persons objected to state their religion. Protestants may be divided as follows:—Dutch Reformed Church, 297,988; Gereformeerde Kerk, 8,837; English Church, 189,058; Presbyterians, 87,102; Independents, 69,692; Methodists, 111,522; other Protestants include, inter alia, 51,557 German Lutherans.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

There is a Legislative Council of 22 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 76 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony, including the Transkeian territories. The Colonial Ministers are the Premier (without portfolio), the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer-General, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. The session lasts usually from May to August.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act 39 of 1877, a Member is added to the Council for that province. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of 2,000l., or movable property worth 4,000l. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act of 1892) by possession of property worth 75l. or receipt of salary or wages of not less than 50l. per
annum; but no one can be newly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation. The number of registered electors in 1892-3 was 90,679. The Registration Act No. 41 of 1887 makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy.

Members of either house are paid one guinea per day, with 1s. per day extra for not more than 90 days if residing over 15 miles from Capetown. Speeches may be made either in English or in Dutch (Law No. 1 of 1882).

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The supreme court, as consolidated by Act No. 40, of 1882, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puisne Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall the territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, and Tembuland.

The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold Sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold Sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and Transkei, and the Judges of the High Court holds session at Kimberley.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. A "Native Territories Penal Code" came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John's on 1st January, 1887.

By Act No. 3 of 1890, the Supreme Court has been constituted a Court of Appeal under the Africa Order in Council of 1889.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of eight elective members exclusive of the Civil Commissioner who is usually also Resident Magistrate as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns ten members. The electors are the registered parliamentary voters, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not less than 500l. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they have also important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; may promote the establishment of a Divisional Police Force, on payment to Government of one-third of the cost of such force; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and roadrates. They were 70 in number in 1892, and their receipts during the year 1892 amounted to 144,286l., of which 5,745l. was money borrowed for public works. Payments for the same period amounted to 144,358l. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of which are elected annually by the ratepayers. Town councils or municipalities have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value, excepting in Capetown, where a landlord's rate of 3d. may be levied.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There were 82 municipalities in the Colony, whose receipts from all sources during the year 1892 amounted to 490,875l., which includes 184,276l. money borrowed for public works. Payments during the same period amounted to 468,882l. The Controller and Auditor-General has no control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 63 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 members elected annually by the voters registered for Parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1891-92 to 6,662l.

Defence.

There is an extensive Admiralty establishment and several forts at Simon's Bay, and to defend this Naval station an Imperial garrison is stationed at Cape Town and Wynberg. The defence of the Colony from native attacks, however, devolves since 1871 upon the Colonial forces. These now consist of the Cape Mounted Rifles (755 strong) and the Cape Police (935 strong), liable in an emergency, which are permanently embodied and paid. There are also 33 Volunteer Corps, of all arms, numbering 5,369 men (with 12 guns), maintained by a capitation grant. Table Bay has been strongly fortified at the joint expense of the War Office and the Colonial Government.

Dependent Territories.

Basutoland, which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa, who also holds the office of Governor of the Cape Colony. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of British Bechuanaland, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under those headings.

The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amakosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms
against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed.

A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1886. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland.

FINGOLAND, IDUTYWA RESERVE, AND NOMAN'S LAND, as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the GCALEKALAND, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Krell, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government, and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Colonel C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Krell deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 THE TEMBUS, OF TEMBULAND proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the BOMVANAS did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885 the Chief KRELL requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas. Pali, chief of the Amatshezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The PONDOMISI tribe, under the chiefs Umditshwa and Umkhonhlo, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, UMPIKELA, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umipikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umipikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.

WEST PONDOLAND is under the Chief Nqufliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for 1,000l.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now subject to Colonial rule (except Pondoland, over which there is a British protectorate), and had a revenue of £78,101l. in 1891-92, and an expenditure of £97,699l.; all of this is included in the ordinary Colonial revenue.

They are now re-grouped, under two Chief Magistrates, with several subordinate magistrates, in the following manner, viz.:

Griqualand East, under one Chief Magistrate, Mr. W. E. Stanford, and nine subordinate magistrates. It had a population of 4,150 Europeans and 148,468 natives in 1891 at census date.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, and Emigrant Tembuland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Major Elliot, C.M.G., and six subordinate magistrates. Major Elliot has also charge of the relations of the Government with Pondoland West. It had a population of 5,179 Europeans and 175,236 natives, including Port St. John's in 1891.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, all under the Chief Magistrate of Tembuland, and six subordinate magistrates. It had a population of 1,019 Europeans and 152,541 natives in 1891.
