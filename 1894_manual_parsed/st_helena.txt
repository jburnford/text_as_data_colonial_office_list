ST. HELENA.

Situation, Area, &c.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of Africa, in 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. It is 101 miles long and 63 broad, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from England, 17 days, and from Capetown, 6 days.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population of about 2,000. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer in Jamestown ranging in summer between 68° and 80°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall in 1892 was 33 inches. The island is very healthy, the average death-rate for the last three years having been only 13 per 1,000, including seamen landed in the island seriously ill.*

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1502. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. The Dutch held it from 1645 to 1650, when they abandoned it. It was taken possession of by the East India Company in 1651, and a charter for its administration was granted in 1661. In 1665 it was seized by the Dutch, who were, however, expelled the same year. Again, in January, 1673, they seized it, to be driven out finally in May, by Captain Munden, of the English Navy. A new charter was issued by Charles II. to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.

The Government maintain 4 schools, having 368 scholars. There are also 7 endowed and private day schools, not aided by Government, having 441 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 4 of 1874, and fees of 1d. a week are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1892 were 948l. and 950l.

Industry.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818, a law was passed that all future children born in the Island should be free.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre. The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost the yield was only about three tons of fibre. Hundreds of acres of flax are now going to waste. Its trade depends exclusively upon the intercourse and the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress, and has greatly diminished in recent years in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war, was in 1883, 521; in 1884, 414; in 1885, 450; in 1886, 377; in 1887, 317; in 1888, 380; in 1889, 288; in 1890, 211; in 1891, 211; and in 1892, 223. It is a port of registry.

The chief industries are fishing and agriculture, the main arable crop being potatoes.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1892, 11,870l.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at 1 per cent.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England alternately every 3 and 5 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal; steamers arrive from thence every third and fifth week, and proceed to England. Rate of postage: to England and the Cape Colony, 6d. per ½ oz.; to other places, 1½d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post, but there are 11½ miles of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 700l. The receipts in 1892 were 87l., and the expenses 188l. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are the Canaries, Capetown, and Loanda. The postal revenue in 1892 was 918l., and the expenditure 177l.

Defence.

Jamestown has been made a second-class imperial coaling station, and extensive defensive works have been constructed on the heights overlooking the harbour.

*The death rate in 1890 was 23 per 1,000, but this includes those killed by the great fall of rocks and nine seamen.
### Constitution

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of Her Majesty in Council.
