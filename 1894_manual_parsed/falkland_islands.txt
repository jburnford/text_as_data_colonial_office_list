FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Moute Video. They consist of the East Falkland (area, 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54½° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Rocque in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited, and almost perpetually icebound. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles (equal to Wales).

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1763 they were taken possession of by France, and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1764. In the following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison, which was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774, and no further formal occupation made till in 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it was moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 694. There is a small hamlet at Darwin. Stanley is a port of registry, and
had on 31st Dec., 1892, 7 vessels, of a total tonnage of 341 tons. It has a fine inner and an outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going round Cape Horn. There are 2 Government schools there, with 140 pupils, 1 school of the Falkland Islands Company, at Darwin, with 24 pupils, and a Roman Catholic school, at Stanley, with 51 pupils, and a private school for infants with an attendance of 23. The attendance is about two-thirds of the numbers on the rolls.

The climate is healthy, though severe. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The winds rise at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. In winter the weather is less boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. The thermometer ranges from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 65° in summer. The average annual rainfall is 28-80 inches. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the clay is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Stone of two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

In the main the Islands are a wild stretch of moorland, but there is a great variety of sweet-scented flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussock grows to the height of seven feet, with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat. On all the small islands along the coast this grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East and West Falkland since cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in a wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, sorrel, &c., besides a small plant called the tea-plant, known and much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos.

The main industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Patagonia. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were in 1892 2,079 horses, 5,755 horned cattle, 642,735 sheep.

The chief export is wool. The other exports consist of frozen mutton, sheep skins, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general supplies, and ship's stores.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no private banks in the Colony. A penny savings bank was established in 1885, in connection with the schools, and had, on 31st Dec., 1892, 527l. deposited; and on 1st April, 1888, a Government savings bank of the usual type was established, in which on 30th September, 1892, the deposits were 24,940l., belonging to 196 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 108,684 acres leased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a very flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is 100,000l., all paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by A. E. Baillon, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England twelve times a year. The German "Kosmos" Steamship Company steamers call at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao six times a year, and six times on the return voyage. The voyage between Stanley and London occupies four weeks. Mails for the Falkland Islands are also carried by the Pacific Company's Steamers, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos Steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to the United Kingdom 2½d. per ½ oz.; to the rest of Europe 4d. per ½ oz.; there is an internal post 1d. the ½ oz. Parcel Postage to London, 9d. pr. lb. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Monte Video. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of 600l.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Colonial Treasurer, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet.

**FIJI.**

**Situation and Area**

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs, between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Tavuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).

**Physical Features.**

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense
forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior, 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 80'S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the "Pandora" in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty." Lying to the north-west, from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofua, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 18th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1891 to number 2,219, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra, of which about 300 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are three native stipendiary magistrates who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor, rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotumah Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner, the chiefs, and magistrates). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1881 and 1891 respectively, was found to be as follows:

| Class of population | Males | Females | Total |
|---------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Europeans           |       |         |       |
| Half-Castes         |       |         |       |
| Indians             |       |         |       |
| Polynesians         |       |         |       |
| Fijians             |       |         |       |
| Rotumans            |       |         |       |
| Others              |       |         |       |

The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1881 was somewhat incorrect inasmuch as there was
then a tendency on the part of the natives to exaggerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the census of 1891 came to be made that tendency had taken a turn in the opposite direction, under the impression that the assessment of taxes would follow the result of the enumeration. The birth and death returns furnished during the ten years, and believed to be fairly accurate, indicate a decrease of about 4,500 in the native Fijian population. The births among the native population in 1892 were 3,996, and the deaths 5,222. The birth rate was 38·19, and the death rate 49·91 per mil. The average rates for the last fourteen years being 57·03 and 45·33 respectively. The death rate among native children is excessive.

Indian immigration has almost taken the place of Polynesian immigration, hence the respective increase and decrease in the population of Indians and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian labourers are both cheaper and more suitable than Polynesians for work on sugar plantations.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions give the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1892:

- Wesleyan ... ... ... 99,835
- Roman Catholic mission ... 10,205

Total ... 110,040

History.

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the "Bounty," sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the Island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled there in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1892 was 94° in the month of February, and the lowest 63° in June and September. The total rainfall during the year was at Suva 105·61 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is the driest period. Between December and April is the hurricane season.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd Jan., 1875. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and three official members, and when sitting for the re-hearing of claims of land, under Ordnance No. 25 of 1879, consists of the ordinary members, with the Chief Justice, the Commissioner for Lands, and Mr. W. S. Carew.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and five official and five non-official nominated members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1892 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the Island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and suburbs numbered 834 at the census of 1891. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had on 31st December, 1892, 7 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 196 tons. During the year 1892 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 331 vessels, of a total tonnage of 3,320; of these 90 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 1,561), and 240 by natives (tonnage 1,759).

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000£ to 19,000£ net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is subdivided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce. The produce contributed consists of sugar-cane, copra, tobacco, yangona (Macro piper Mythisticum), cotton, maize, beche-de-mer, and occasionally green fruit and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar mills under contracts which are generally entered into for a term of years. Copra (the principal item in which native taxes are paid) is sold by public tender annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed price per ton for all that is received.
Cotton is, under existing arrangements, gained by prison labour, and thereafter sold in the same manner as tobacco, maize, and other products, by tender or by public auction as the quantity from time to time contributed, and the state of the market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money. The amount thus returned in 1892 was £9,986l.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Levuka, and in 1892 one was established in Suva on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

A grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1892 were: Suva town board, £1,476l. and £1,465l.; ditto school board, £628l. and £609l.; Levuka town board, £999l. and £930l.; ditto school board, £614l. and £613l.

Total receipts of local authorities, £3,714l.; total expenditure, £3,617l., in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Education.

Until December, 1890, the town boards performed also the functions of school boards within their respective districts, and were authorised to levy a rate of 6d. in the pound for school purposes, receiving also from Government a grant not exceeding one-half the amount required for specified expenses beyond the sum raised by school fees.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council, and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva with 71 scholars, and one in Levuka with 75 scholars.

There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka, and one in Suva, with an attendance of 108.

There is a Government technical school on Vanua Levu, where 73 native youths are instructed in primary education, planting, boat building, and other industrial pursuits. The school is partly self-supporting.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 1,951 schools, with 2,417 native teachers, and 38,307 scholars.

The latter have 144 schools, with 1,950 scholars.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The following banks have branches in Fiji, viz.: The Bank of New Zealand (Suva and Levuka), and the Union Bank of Australin, Ltd. (Suva), both of which issue notes.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue. The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., Ltd., does business as a loan and mortgage company in the Colony.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the cocoanut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 34 tons were exported. Since that date the cultivation of kidney cotton has revived, and now gives indications of considerable expansion. In the meantime, the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney. This trade has increased year by year, until it now ranks as the export second only in importance to that of sugar.

The quantity of fruit exported during the year 1892 was 788,100 bunches of bananas, 5,555 cases, and 3 packages (pineapples for the most part), and 65 cwts. of dried fruit, which valued at 1s. 6d. per bunch and 12s. per package on an average, amounts to £2,564l. The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, grenadillas, and perhaps mangoes, which might well be extended.

The following table, which shows the quantity and value of the three staple products that have been exported during the last nine years, will illustrate the expansion of the trade of the Colony:—
