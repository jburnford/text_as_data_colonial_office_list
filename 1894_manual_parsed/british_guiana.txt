BRITISH GUIANA.

Situation and Area.

This Colony is a portion of the South American Continent, extending from east to west about 300 miles, and from north to south about 550 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice, and is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyne, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and northeast by the Atlantic Ocean. Its area is about 109,000 square miles, about the size of the United Kingdom, extending from 9° to 1° north latitude, and from 57° to 62° west longitude. About 180 square miles only are under cultivation.

History and Constitution.

The territory was first partially settled by the Dutch West India Company in 1580 by planting a depot on the River Pomeroon in the present county of Essequebo. In 1624 a settlement was founded on the Berbice by Van Peere, a Flushing merchant, under license from the Company. The first English attempt at settlement was made by Captain Leigh on the Ozapock river in 1604. The effort, though followed up by Robert Harcourt in 1613 and 1627, failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, also turned his attention to Guiana, and founded a settlement on the Surinam in 1663, which was captured by the Dutch in 1667, and ceded to them at the peace of Breda in exchange for New York. The Dutch retained their hold on the three colonies with more or less firmness, now yielding to England, now to France or Portugal, till 1796, when during the war of the French Revolution they were captured by a British Fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, and finally ceded to that power in 1814.

Under the Dutch, Demerara and Essequebo constituted one Government, and Berbice another, an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1732; under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Demerara appears to have been established in 1773. In 1789 that for Essequebo was merged in it, and the seat of Government for the United provinces established at Stabroek, the site of the present capital Georgetown. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government, and the West India Company, as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1788, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution), was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government, established a new one for the joined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation, notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and in 1802, and its cession in 1803; the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before.

The Council or Court of Policy consisted of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequebo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequebo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequebo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each Colony,* each consisting of seven Members, elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the Office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned, or ceased to be an inhabitant.

In 1795 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds.† In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon annulled this arrangement, and to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation enacted that in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proclamation remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when the three provinces were united, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

With an exception in regard to the franchise, to be noticed hereafter, this has been the usage and procedure till now, from which the inference has been drawn that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.‡

The colonial members have never acquiesced in this interpretation of the constitution, and there have been frequent collisions between the Executive and Elective sections of the Court.§ The position they assume is based upon the construction of a passage in a decree of the States-General, dated 27th August, 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves;"

* Demerara and Essequebo only are here alluded to.

‡ During the discussions on the Civil List in 1848-9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governors the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.
§ Proceedings relative to the Functions of the Financial Representative, 1832.
and a passage in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1793, "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a great number of the Colonists, for example the 'Kiezers of both rivers.' The nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806 has also been held to support this contention.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Phillip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty; and from that date till 1891 the only constitutional legislation was the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution may be summed up very briefly. It consists of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly are performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which are dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passes all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which is passed by the Combined Court.

During 1891 an Act was passed, which came into force in 1892, effecting a considerable change in the constitution. By this Act the administrative functions of the Court of Policy have been transferred to an executive council, and the duties of the former become purely legislative.

The Combined Court has the power of (1) imposing the Colonial taxes and auditing the public accounts; and (2) discussing freely and without reserve the items on the annual estimates prepared by the Governor, in Executive Council. The first of these powers is the birthright of the Combined Court, having been bestowed in 1796, when Governor Beaujon called the financial representatives into being, "with a right of voting only for the raising of colonial taxes and not further," while the second is conferred periodically by Her Majesty's Order in Council after each renewal of the Civil List and is co-existent with the Civil List.

The Court of Policy, under the new constitution, consists of the governor, seven official members, and eight elected members. It may be prorogued or dissolved at any time by the Governor and in any case is dissolved at the end of five years, and a general election must be held within two months of the date of a dissolution. The number of the financial representatives, who with the Court of Policy form the Combined Court, remains unchanged.

The qualification for membership of the Court of Policy, which hitherto was restricted to ownership of 80 acres of land, 40 of which had to be under cultivation, is extended to ownership of immovable property of the value of not less than £1,562l. 10s. or of a house, or house and land, of the annual rental value of £250l.

The qualification for election as a financial representative is the same as for membership of the Court of Policy, with the further qualification of clear annual income of £300l. arising from any kind of property not mentioned in any other property qualification, or from any profession, business, or trade carried on in the colony.

The College of Electors, which elected members of the Court of Policy, has been abolished, and members are now elected by the direct vote of the people.

The franchise in the case of county voters is extended to every person who during the six months previous to registration has had—

(1.) Ownership of not less than three acres of land actually under cultivation; or of a house, or a house and land, of the annual rental or value of not less than £20l.; or (2.) occupation or tenancy of not less than six acres of land under cultivation; or of a house, or of a house and land, of the annual rental or value of not less than £40l.; or

(3.) An annual income or salary of not less than £100l., coupled with residence in the district or division; or

(4.) Has paid during the twelve months previous to registration direct taxes to the Colonial revenue of £1l. 3s. 4d. or upwards, coupled with residence in the district or division during the six months previous to registration.

In the case of city voters the franchise extends to every person who has had during the six months previous to registration:

(1.) Ownership of a house, or of a house and premises, of the value of not less than £104l. 3s. 4d.; or

(2.) Occupation or tenancy, of a house, or of a house and premises, of the annual rental or value of not less than £25l.; or

(3.) An annual income or salary of not less than £100l., coupled with residence in the district or

(4.) Has paid during the twelve months previous to registration, direct taxes to the colonial revenue of £1l. 3s. 4d. or upwards, coupled with residence in the district during the six months previous to registration.

Aliens who previously acquired the political rights of citizenship after three years' residence, are now debarred from such rights while they remain aliens.

The number of registered electors is 2,046.

There is a Public Officers Guarantee Fund, and also a Widow and Orphans' Fund, towards the latter of which all officers with salaries over £100l. contribute 4 per cent. of their salaries.

Local Government.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated, but the principle has not been materially extended in its application.

The existing municipal authorities are: mayor and town council, Georgetown; and mayor and town council, New Amsterdam. Their revenue in 1892 was respectively £49,586l.—£8,084l., and their expenditure £53,251l.—£7,132l. There are also 18 villages incorporated, whose revenue and expenditure in 1892 were respectively £3,745l. and £5,797l. The total village debt was £16,118l.

The Roman Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by Orders in Council and local Ordinances; the Criminal Law is now based on that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that there is no Grand Jury.

Internal Communications.

The three rivers, Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice, are navigable for 90, 35, and 150 miles
respectively. Beyond these distances, owing to the mountainous nature of the country, they abound in cataracts and waterfalls. There is a good network of roads, and there are small canals in connection with the Demerara River. There is a railway from Georgetown to Mahaica, about 20 miles in length, owned by the British Guiana Railway Company, Limited. Its receipts in 1891 were £8,824l., its expenses £8,387l. The line was constructed at a total cost of £80,000l. The postal telegraph system comprises about 260 miles of line, with eight cables covering a distance of 69 miles. It is in connection with a cable to Trinidad, and thus with Europe and the United States. The revenue from this source in 1892 was £4,546, and the expenditure £678l. A telephone exchange (400 subscribers) is established at Georgetown and at New Amsterdam in connection with the postal telegraph; length of telephone lines 189 miles, longest line 15 miles. There are lines of local steamers between Georgetown, New Amsterdam, and some stations on the rivers. A well organised postal service extends throughout the colony, letters reaching Pomeroon in 24 hours from Georgetown.

Education.

A state aided system of elementary education was established by Law No. 14 of 1876. The schools are denominational, except the Estates schools. The central administration is vested in the Inspector of Schools, and the local control conducted by managers, who are usually ministers of religion.

The number of schools receiving aid in 1892 was 187, with 25,734 scholars, and the aid granted amounted to £7,894l.

Provision is made for higher education by a Government college in Georgetown, in which the course of instruction is similar to that of a public school or first grade grammar school in England, and there is awarded annually one public scholarship of the value of £200 per annum, tenable at a University in England for three years; or in the event of the scholar selecting the medical profession, the scholarship is tenable for five years at £150 per annum.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. British sterling and United States gold coin is current and legal tender, as well as Spanish and Mexican gold. Spanish, Mexican, or Columbian dollars are no longer legal tender, under Ordinance No. 6 of 1876. There are also remaining some old silver tokens from one-eighth to three guilders (one guilder being equal to one shilling and fourpence).

The "Colonial" and "British Guiana" Banks have establishments at Georgetown, with branches at New Amsterdam. The British Guiana Bank on the 30th June, 1891, had a note circulation of £84,866l., and the Colonial Bank £58,578l. The total note circulation in the Colony is about £145,000l.

The first Government savings banks were established at Georgetown and New Amsterdam in the year 1886. A branch bank was opened at Suddie, Essequibo, in 1879, at Belfield on the East Coast, Demerara, in 1884, and another at Fellowship on the West Coast, Demerara, in 1887. The total deposits amounted on 31st December, 1891, to £253,527l., among 14,678 depositors. There are 12 Post Office Savings Banks. At the end of that year these banks had 8,031 depositors, with £22,529l. to their credit.

Industry and Productions.

The staple products of British Guiana were in former years sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, and coffee. The soil of some parts of the Colony is capable of producing coffee of rare excellence, the Berbice River coffee being once much prized. The latter two industries have now given place to the cultivation of the sugar-cane, which at present is the chief industry of the Colony, and furnishes eighty-two per cent. in value of its exports. Timber, charcoal, rice, and coco-nuts are also exported. The total area of sugar plantations is 165,000 acres, of which 50,000 are under sugar, 2,700 under plantains, and the remainder uncultivated.

The forests, with which the interior of the colony is covered, abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of household furniture.

There were 90 sugar estates in active operation in British Guiana in the year 1892, having an aggregate of sugar cane cultivation of 76,974 acres, and of plantain cultivation of 2,304 acres. The sugar crop for 1892 yielded about 125,422 hogsheads exported. The bulk of the production is the high class sugar known as Demerara crystals.

Further attention is being given to the planting of coffee and cocoa on the vegetable soils to the rear of the cane grove;* and several abandoned coffee estates are being reclaimed. Rice is now grown to a considerable extent on the Coolie Settlement at "Huist Dieren," and by Free Coolies on the Savannah lands behind the Sugar Estates.

Gold washing is carried on by about 7,000 diggers, and is rapidly increasing, 14,570 ozs. having been exported in 1888, valued at £55,566, while in 1891, 101,298 ozs. valued at £375,289 were exported; in 1892, 133,147 ozs. valued at £494,551l. The royalty received amounted to £25,824l. Rich quartz assaying from 56 to 152 ozs., to the ton has been tested, but quartz mining has not as yet been attempted. India-rubber, ballate, and other gums are also exported.

The values of the principal exports besides sugar and gold are:—Timber, 21,832l.; gums, 11,687l.; hides, 1,569l.; shingles, 1,918l.

The chief imports are rice, flour, machinery, dried fish, and manure.

Half the trade is with the United Kingdom, and a third with the United States; the other important countries being India, Canada, and the West Indies.

Climate.

The climate is hot, but not unhealthy. The mean temperature throughout the year is about 82° Feh., the mean maximum being 88° in the month of September, and the mean minimum 74° in the month of January. The heat, which is greatly tempered by cooling breezes from the sea prevailing during the greater portion of the year, is felt more in August and September than at other times, owing to the partial cessation of these breezes.

*The cocoa estates are chiefly on Canal No. 1, West Bank of the Demerara River, and cocoa is grown on a small scale on some sugar estates aback of the cane cultivation. Coffee was grown principally in the country of Berbice, and the Liberian coffee bean was in past years planted with great success also on some estates on Canal No. 1. Its production has fallen to below the local demands.
There are annually two wet seasons, about Christmas and midsummer, for two months each. The annual rainfall is about 75 in. in Georgetown. 1890, like 1889, was an unusually wet year, the rainfall was 122 in.; in 1892, 117.42 inches.

**Towns.**

The capital is Georgetown, situated in lat. 6° 49' 24" N., and long. 58° 11' 30" W., and possessing a population of 53,176 in 1891. New Amsterdam had a population of 8,903 in 1891. Both these are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1892, 140 vessels, of a total tonnage of 6,849.

**Means of Communication.**

The regular mail communication with the Colony is maintained by the vessels of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which leave Southampton every alternate Thursday, those of the Cie. Generale Transatlantique, from France and the West Indies, and the Dutch line from Holland and Havre, both monthly; and those of the Atlantic and West India line from New York every six weeks. There are other lines of steamers trading to the Colony which carry mails, but their periods of departure are uncertain. The length of the voyage between Georgetown and England is 18½ days.

There are no Imperial troops stationed at Georgetown; but there are militia forces at Georgetown and New Amsterdam, which must be maintained at a minimum strength of 60 men per corps. There are no modern fortifications in the Colony.

The customs revenue in 1892-3 was £291,744l. Excise duties, £68,203l.
