HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton, between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles (a third larger than Guernsey). It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (24 square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutters', Green, Aplechow, Middle, Round, and other islets.
requirement for making repairs to large ships of war and merchant vessels. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company was aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885, under The Colonial Docks Act.

Currency and Banking.

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 9th Jan., 1863; Ordinance, 1 of 1864; and Proclamation in "Government Gazette," 14th Sept., 1866):—

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. The Hong Kong dollar, half-dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
3. Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
4. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint 2,108,054 dollars, and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of $402,671. There have been obtained from England, and put into circulation up to 31st Dec., 1892, subsidiary coins (which now include half-dollars) to the nominal value of $8,220,125. Importation of copper coins has been discontinued.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now, and of the coins imported from England it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent. remains in the Colony.

There are five principal banks (Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and National Bank of China, and the Bank of China, Japan, and the Straits) having a note circulation of $6,438,710 on 31st Dec., 1892. There is no savings bank under Government control, but one conducted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. The Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris has an agency in the Colony.

Local weights and measures are the following: 1 tael = 1 oz.; 1 picul = 133 lbs.; 1,000 Chinese cash =

Means of Communication.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly the whole world by a cable to Shanghai (and thence to Japan and Russia) and two cables to Singapore via Saigon and Hué respectively; and there is very extensive steam communication with Europe, America, and Australia.

In addition to the regular mail lines of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Messageries Maritimes which convey the European mails weekly, the Pacific Mail Steam Navigation Company have a fortnightly service, via Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco, and the Eastern and Australian Mail Steam Company and the China Navigation Company have a frequent service to the Australian Colonies. The Norddeutsche Lloyd and the Austrian Lloyd steamers go to and from Europe monthly, and the Canadian Pacific Mail Company have a three-weekly service to Europe via Vancouver and the Canadian Pacific Railway; also the Portland Line of steamers have a monthly service to Portland, Oregon, touching at Japanese Ports, and Victoria, British Columbia. Letters from England reach Hong Kong in about 31 days.

There is daily steam communication between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton, and almost daily with Swatow, Amoy, Foo Chow, Shanghai, and other ports on the coast of China. The communication with Japan is three or four times a week. There are no railways (but a cable tramway from the city to the higher levels was opened in 1888); and no internal telegraph communication except for police and military purposes. The island possesses few roads, and the usual means of conveyance outside Victoria is by boat. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. | Cost |
|------------------|------|
| Hong Kong, Canton and Macao | 2 cents |
| China and Japan | 5 " |
| United Kingdom | 7 " |
| Europe, America, and Australasia | 10 " |
| South Africa | 20 " |

The postal agencies in China at Canton, Swatow, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo, Hankow, and Hoihow are under the superintendence of the postmaster at Hong Kong.

Education.

There is the Victoria College (a secondary Government Boys' School, with low fees) a Police school and a Reformatory, and 35 free Government schools (6 teaching English). A Government Girls' School was opened in 1890. Besides these, there are 95 grant-in-aid-schools, 88 of which are free, belonging to 10 different Missionary Societies. These are denominational, the Government schools being strictly secular. There were 8,277 scholars on the rolls in 1892, besides 2,663 in 99 private schools, mostly Chinese, which are not aided or inspected. The only central administrative organisation is the education department in charge of the Inspector of Schools. The languages taught are English, Portuguese, and two separate dialects of Chinese. Some scholarships have been founded by Government and by private individuals for higher education. There is one school for industrial education, and a college of medicine for Chinese.

Revenue.

One-fourth of the revenue is derived from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes, 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria, 10½ per cent. in the Hill Districts, 8½ per cent. at Kowloon, and 7 per cent. in the outlying villages, payable by the owners. The remainder is derived from opium and other licences, land revenue, stamps and fees.

Defence.

There is an Imperial garrison of about 2,800 men, including the Hong Kong Regiment, which arrived in 1891, towards the cost of which the Colony contributes £40,000l. annually. There is also a Volunteer Artillery Corps with about 85 honorary and 85 effective members. The port is the head-quarters of the China Squadron of some 20 vessels, and there is usually at least one war vessel present. Land batteries of powerful armament have been erected with the view of protecting the town and anchorage. There is an armed police 666 strong, of whom 126 are Europeans, 211 Sikhs, and the rest Chinese.

Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19 Jan., 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six
officials besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of six official and five unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (one being usually a Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. By the provisions of the Vice-Admiralty Courts Act of 1863, the Governor is ex officio Vice-Admiral, and the Chief Justice ex officio Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 13 of 1873.
