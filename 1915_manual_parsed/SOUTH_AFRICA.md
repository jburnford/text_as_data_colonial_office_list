SOUTH AFRICA.

The Union of South Africa is constituted under the South Africa Act, 1909 (9 Edw. 7, ch. 9), passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on the 20th September, 1909. In terms of that Act the self-governing Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony become united on the 31st day of May, 1910, in a legislative Union under one Government under the name of the Union of South Africa, those Colonies becoming original provinces of the Union under the names of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State respectively.

The Act constituting the Union provides for the appointment by the Sovereign of a Governor-General, who, with an Executive Council (of which the members are chosen and summoned by him), administers the executive government of the Union as the Governor-General in Council. Departments of State are established by the Governor-General in Council, the Governor-General appointing not more than ten officers to administer them. Such officers are King's Ministers of State for the Union and members of the Executive Council.

The Senate consists of forty members. For ten years after the establishment of the Union eight are nominated by the Governor-General in Council and thirty-two are elected, eight for each province. The first election was made prior to the establishment of the Union by the two Houses of each of the Colonial Legislatures sitting as one body, and a vacancy will be filled by the choice of the Provincial Council in respect of whose province a vacancy occurs.

The House of Assembly consists of 130 elected members, 51 of whom represent the Cape of Good Hope, 17 Natal, 45 Transvaal, and 17 the Orange Free State. Members of both Houses must be British subjects of European descent.

The qualifications of voters are the same as in the Colonies at the time of union, and no subsequent law is to disqualify any person in the Cape from voting, by reason of his race or colour, who could vote under the existing law, unless the bill is passed by both Houses together, with a two-thirds majority of the total membership. [In the Transvaal and Orange River Colony the franchise was restricted to white men; in Natal a native could obtain a vote, but under conditions which made this very difficult; in Cape Colony any native could do so who has a certain property qualification and can write his name.]

Pretoria is the capital and seat of government of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Legislature.

The first Parliamentary Election under the South Africa Act was held on the 15th September, 1910, and the Union Parliament was opened by H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught, K.G.

Provinces.

A Provincial Council in each province has power to legislate by ordinance on certain subjects specified in the Act, and on such other subjects as may be delegated to it. The specified subjects include direct taxation for provincial purposes, the borrowing of money on the credit of the province, primary education (for five years), agriculture, hospitals, municipal institutions, local works other than railways and harbours, roads, markets, game preservation and other purely local or private matters. In addition the Union Parliament may delegate the power of making Ordinances on any subject to Provincial Councils. All ordinances passed by a Provincial Council are subject to the veto of the Governor-General in Council. Members of the Provincial Council are elected on the same system as members of Parliament, but the restriction as to European descent does not apply. The number of members in each Provincial Council is as follows:

| Province            | Number |
|---------------------|--------|
| Cape of Good Hope   | 51     |
| Natal               | 25     |
| Transvaal           | 45     |
| Orange Free State   | 25     |

The first Provincial elections for the Cape of Good Hope and the Transvaal were held on the 15th September, 1910; those for Natal and the Orange Free State on the 12th October, 1910.

The executive power in the subjects on which the Provincial Council is empowered to make ordinances is vested in an Executive Committee consisting of an Administrator, appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and four members elected by the Provincial Council.

Areas and Population.

| Province            | Area, Square Miles | Population, Census, May, 1911 |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|

| Orange Free State   | 50,389            | 528,174                      |
| Total               | 473,100           | 5,973,394                    |
Of the total 5,973,394 persons (1911), 3,069,392 were males and 2,904,002 females.

The increase for the Union (1904-11) was 15·41 per cent. For the Provinces it was as follows:—Cape, 6·44 per cent.; Natal, 7·69 per cent.; Transvaal, 32·78 per cent.; Orange Free State, 36·37 per cent.

The population comprised (1911) 1,276,242 Europeans or whites (591,078 females); 4,019,006 natives, (1,996,057 females); and 678,146 other coloured races (316,867 females). In 1904 the figures were:—Europeans, 1,116,806 (increase 1904-11 of 14·28 per cent.); natives 3,491,056 (increase 1904-11 of 15·12 per cent.); and other coloured races 567,962 (increase 1904-11 of 19·40 per cent.). The total non-European increase (1904-11) was 15·72 per cent. The proportion of Europeans in the total population in 1904 was 21·58 per cent.; in 1911, 21·37 per cent.

Some of the principal urban centres in the Union with over 10,000 inhabitants in 1911, had a white population as follows:

| Cities          | Census, 1904 | Census, 1911 |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Johannesburg    | 83,363       | 119,953      |

Climate.

Cape Province.

The climate of the Cape Province is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice is practically unknown except in the more elevated localities, particularly of the north-east. The mean annual temperature at the Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, in 33°, 56 mins. S. lat., and 18°, 29 mins. E. long., is 62·2°, the mean maximum being 70·8°, and the mean minimum 53·5°; the average rainfall for the last 70 years is 25·59 inches. Cape Town itself has a mean annual temperature of 62·6°, the mean day temperature being 71·3° and the mean night temperature 53·4°. Aliwal North, 30°, 41 mins. S. lat., and 26°, 40 mins. E. long. (4,330 feet above sea level), shows a mean temperature of 59·2°, the mean maximum being 74·2°, and the mean minimum 44·1°; the rainfall average of 42 years being 24·0 inches. At the Royal Observatory the warmest days occur in February, when the average maximum is 80°·0 F., and the coldest nights in July, with an average minimum of 46°·3° F.; compared with these data the average maximum temperature of the warmest month (February), in Cape Town, is 81°·8°, and the average minimum of the coldest month (July), is 47°·4°; at Aliwal North, January is the warmest month, the day temperature averaging 84°·4°, whereas in July, when the coldest nights are experienced, the mean average minimum is only 28°·7° F.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (November to April), in the Western districts during the winter months, while along the South Coast the rainfall is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the twelve months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Natal Province.

The climate of the Natal Province varies at different levels. On the coast-line it is subtropical, but is considerably modified inland owing to increased altitude. Thus Umzinto in the South near the coast, at an altitude of 400 feet, has a mean annual temperature of 71·8°; Durban (261 feet), 70·8°; whilst Howick, at an elevation of 3,439 feet, has an average yearly temperature of 63·0°. In the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced. Snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer and the sky is bright throughout the winter months. Hot winds occasionally occur towards the end of the year (September-November), when temperatures of 100° to 110° may be recorded. At Pietermaritzburg (2,200 feet) the annual temperature is 66·6°, with an average maximum of 79·9° and a minimum of 53·4°. The warmest days occur in February, when the mean maximum averages 86·3° and the coldest nights in June, when the mean minimum is 41·3°. Again, Weenen (2,840 feet), situated in a deep cup-shaped valley, has a mean annual temperature of 66·4°, the mean maximum being 83·7°, and the mean minimum 49·2°; the hottest month is January, when the mean maximum is 92·3°, and the coldest nights are experienced in July, when the mean minimum is only 31·4°.

The average rainfall over the Province is approximately 34 inches, being about 40 inches along the coast belt (Durban 43·45 inches) and mostly 30·35 inches inland, but decreasing to 25·5 inches at Weenen. Thunderstorms are frequent and destructive hailstorms are common during the summer months.

Malarial fever was epidemic in coast districts during 1905 and 1906, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the authorities, it has been stamped out, while very few cases have occurred inland.

Transvaal Province.

Owing to the altitude (4,000 to 6,000 feet) of the plateau constituting the greater part of the Transvaal Province, the climate on the whole is healthy, cool and bracing; over the Lowveld to the North and East, however, it is hot and fever-stricken, and not at all adapted for stock owing to various endemic diseases. During summer the days are hot, occasionally exceeding 100 deg., but tempered by frequent thunderstorms, while the nights are mild to warm. During the winter months (April to September) the days are usually bright, sunny and almost cloudless, being frequently almost as warm as in summer, while the nights are cold with frequent frost and haze or fog. The rainfall is greatest in the East, Woodbush in the North-East (Zoutpansberg District) having an average of 85·06 inches in 143 days; it decreases rapidly, however, westward from the escarpment falling to 17·67 inches at Christiana in 56 days. The mean annual
temperature shows considerable variation according to position and altitude; thus, Volksrust in the South-East, near the Natal border, at an elevation of 5,300 feet, has an annual temperature of 56°9 deg., whilst Komati Poort, bordering Portuguese East Africa, at a height of only 460 feet above sea level, has an average temperature of 73°1 deg. Pretoria, the administrative capital, has an annual average temperature of 63°5 deg., with a rainfall of 29°44 inches; the warmest days there occur in December, when the mean maximum is 84°0 deg., whereas the coldest nights are met with during July, when the mean minimum is 34°8 deg. The warmest month, however, is January, with a mean of 71°8 deg., and the coldest July, with 51°7 deg. The town of Johannesburg has a mean yearly temperature of 59°9 deg., with an average rainfall of about 31 inches. Although the mean warmest month there is also January (67°5 deg.), the warmest days occur in December, when the mean maximum is 79°4 deg., and the coldest nights in July, when the mean minimum is 37°3 deg., and the monthly temperature 49°5 deg. Duststorms are frequent during the latter part of August and throughout September. Thunderstorms also are frequent during summer, more particularly from November to January, and destructive hailstorms are apt to occur at this season, destroying trees and crops. Strong, biting, cold, southerly winds blow from time to time during the winter, although the prevalent winds are mostly northerly.

Orange Free State Province.

The Orange Free State can be separated, roughly, into three divisions, viz., the Western, the Middle and the Eastern.

The Western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile. Rainfall averages 14 inches.

The Middle division, through which the main line railway runs, holds moisture longer than the Western division. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock. Rainfall averages 18 inches.

The Eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe. Rainfall averages 24 inches.

The heat, especially in the Middle and Western divisions, is great during the months of December, January and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein (altitude 4,510 feet above the sea) has risen on individual days to 102 deg. Fahr. at noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 74 deg. and the mean minimum 48 deg.

The Eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful, in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein (Grey College) for period 1903-11:—January, 4°65 inches; February, 2°93; March, 3°97; April, 1°64; May, 1°10; June, 0°26; July, 0°22; August, 0°21; September, 0°70; October, 1°23; November, 2°60; December, 1°75. Total for year, 21°16 inches.

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

Vital Statistics.

In the Cape Province the European birth-rate in 1912 was computed to be 31°39 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 10°74 per 1,000. As the registration of births and deaths amongst the coloured population is imperfect, the birth and death rates cannot be calculated accurately.

In the Transvaal Province the European birth-rate in 1913 was computed to be 33°94 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 9°66 per 1,000.

In the Orange Free State Province the European birth-rate in 1913 was computed to be 28°78 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 8°07 per 1,000. In Natal Province the European birth-rate in 1913 was computed to be 28°50 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 10°08.

Railways and Harbours.

During 1913 4,349 vessels of 12,939,454 tons net entered, and 4,331 vessels of 12,911,742 tons net cleared.

Prior to Union, which took effect in May, 1910, the state railways of the several colonies now comprising the Union were operated by the separate Governments. In May, 1910, the Government lines were merged into one system, the South African Railways, under the control of the Union Government. The total open mileage of this system at the end of 1913 was 8,280 miles (comprising Cape 3,639, Orange Free State 1,163, Transvaal 2,362, and Natal 1,116), of which 7,807 miles are 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, and 473 miles 2 ft. gauge.

The capital expenditure on Government railways up to 31st December, 1913, amounted to £68,034,999, plus £14,457,155L in respect of rolling stock, or a total of £82,492,154L.

The gross earnings for 1913 were £12,388,755L, and the net profit after payment of interest £571,242L.

Working expenditure (including renewals) amounted to £8,964,690L, or 72°36 per cent. of the gross revenue, as compared with £7,873,344L, or 64°29 per cent. of the gross revenue in the preceding year.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Table Bay (Cape Town), Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. These ports are now under the direct control of the Department of Railways and Harbours.

Table Bay.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater 3,640 feet long and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 67 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 75½ acres, with about 2½ miles of berthing, and a depth ranging from 20 to 35 feet at low water. The normal capacity of the docks is 8,000 tons per diem. There is also a graving dock of 500 feet capacity on the keel blocks, with a depth of 2½ feet over the sill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T., and a slip is available for vessels up to 500 tons.
Port Elizabeth.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,160 feet long, and a third jetty, 1,460 feet long.

In addition to the above, there is an isolated landing stage 105 feet by 36 feet for landing dynamite, etc., by means of an aerial tramway, which is capable of landing 5,000 cases per diem, also a slipway capable of carrying vessels of 400 tons dead weight drawing 9 feet 3 inches to 14 feet 7 inches at H.W.O.S.T.

The construction of a new breakwater is shortly to be commenced at an estimated cost of £1,500,000. The total length of the breakwater will be 8,500 feet, it will be composed of fifty ton sloping concrete block work, and will admit of work being carried out at the existing jetties in smooth water, and an area of 800 acres will be entirely sheltered from the seas caused by the prevailing winds.

East London.

The port of East London is situated at the mouth of the Buffalo River, the entrance being protected by a solid breakwater and training walls. The dock area is 100 acres in extent. Vessels drawing up to 24 feet draught and of over 8,000 tons gross register enter the river and discharge alongside the wharfs, the total length of which amounts to about 5,000 feet. A patent slip provides every facility for effecting repairs to vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight.

It is proposed to extend the breakwater and works on the east bank at a cost of £400,000. With the completion of this scheme vessels of increased size and draught will be able to enter the harbour. The negotiation of the harbour entrance will also be made easier.

Durban.

Durban harbour is accessible at all times to the largest vessels navigating southern waters.

The harbour is approached through the Bluff Channel, 4,000 feet in length, formed by a north pier and a south breakwater. These works are 800 feet apart, except at the pier heads, where the breadth is only 600 feet. The average low-water depth at the entrance is 33 feet, and in the harbour channels 30 feet. The land-locked bay inside these piers extends about 3½ miles east and west, and nearly two miles north and south. The wharves have a length of 2¾ miles, with depths alongside of from 23 feet to 38 feet, 6 inches L.W.O.S.T. The deep-water space available for shipping covers about one-ninth of the area, and gives a low-water depth of not less than 30 feet over its greater part.

It has been decided to build a graving dock at this Port at an estimated cost of £780,000. It is intended that the dimensions of the dock shall be 1,030 feet in length, 110 feet broad at entrance, 41 feet deep on silt at H.W.O.S.T., or 35 feet deep at low water. It will be seen, therefore, that the new dock will accommodate a vessel of larger dimensions than the latest dock at Panama.

Sea and Land Communications.

The packets of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Union Government, leave England and the Union (Table Bay) weekly on Saturdays, the passage to be affected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 9 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena and Ascension. The distance by sea from England to the Union varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail packets call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages. The St. Helena-Ascension service is performed by the intermediate steamers of the company, under agreement with the Imperial post office.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay, are also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A frequent service to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Savill and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Lund’s Blue Anchor Line, the White Star Line, and the German-Australian Steamship Company.

There is a mail Service with Mauritius and East Coast Ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.), once or twice a month and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. There are also two direct lines of Steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is 26 days.

Communication is effected between the principal towns in the Union daily; with Rhodesia three times a week and with Lourenço Marques daily.

Mail trains leave Cape Town daily, one at 11.40 a.m. for the Transvaal via Kimberley, and the other at 9.30 p.m. for the Midland and Eastern portions of the Cape Province, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Natal. Return trains leave Pretoria daily, one at 9.30 a.m. via Kimberley, and the other at 7.45 p.m. via the Orange Free State, arriving at Cape Town at 6.55 a.m. and 6.5 p.m. respectively on the third day.

The 11.40 a.m. train from Cape Town on Saturdays and Thursdays is extended to Bulawayo. The train leaving Cape Town on Thursdays connects at Bulawayo with the “Zambesi Express,” arriving at Victoria Falls on Tuesdays. The “Northern Express” leaves Cape Town on Tuesdays at 11.0 a.m., arriving at Bulawayo at 9.10 p.m. on Thursdays, and Victoria Falls at 3.0 p.m. on Fridays. In the opposite direction the “Southern Express” leaves Victoria Falls at 8.33 p.m. on Tuesdays, Bulawayo at 6.40 p.m. on Wednesdays, and is due to reach Cape Town at 10.15 a.m. on Saturdays. The “Rhodesia Express” leaves Victoria Falls at 12.33 p.m. on Saturdays, connecting at Bulawayo with the train for the south on Mondays. In addition to the “Southern Express” from Bulawayo on Wednesdays trains leave that station on Mondays and Fridays at 8.40 a.m., connecting at Kimberley with the ordinary train from the Transvaal, and due to arrive at Cape Town at 6.55 a.m. on Thursdays and Mondays.

On Tuesdays the “Orange Limited” train leaves Cape Town at 9.15 a.m. for Johannesburg and Pretoria, via Orange Free State; on Saturdays the “Transvaal Limited” train leaves Cape Town at 8.0 p.m. for Johannesburg and Pretoria, via Kimberley; and on Saturdays the “Cape Limited” train leaves Pretoria at 6.5 p.m. for Cape Town, via Kimberley. These trains perform the journey between Cape Town and Johannesburg and vice versa in 36 hours.
The Imperial Mail Train-de-Luxe runs via the Orange Free State, leaving Pretoria at 6.5 p.m., and Johannesburg at 8.15 p.m. on Thursday evenings, reaching Cape Town on Saturdays at 10.45 a.m., and going through to Cape Town Docks for the convenience of passengers for the mail steamer leaving for England on that day.

On Tuesdays a train conveying the European mails brought by the incoming mail steamer is despatched from the docks Cape Town to all parts of South Africa.

Mail trains leave Durban at 5.50 p.m. and 7.20 p.m. daily for Johannesburg and Pretoria. In the return direction trains leave Johannesburg at 9.30 a.m., and 8.0 p.m. daily for Durban.

Posts and Telegraphs.

At the end of 1913 there were in the Union 2,783 posts and telegraph offices. During the year 191,693,385 articles of mail matter were posted, of which 14,837,849 were addressed to countries outside the Union. 1,628,321 registered packets were dealt with. The ordinary telegraph traffic amounted to 5,863,899 messages; there were 6,044 wireless messages handled, and 50,022,000 telephone calls. The number of money orders issued was 489,829 of a total value of 2,950,126£., while the number paid was 386,193 of a total value of 2,271,542£. Postal orders issued numbered 3,595,255, amounting to 2,263,831£. in value, and the number paid was 2,788,167, valued at 1,688,024£.

The revenue and expenditure in respect of the postal service during 1913 amounted to 1,049,414£. and 1,021,215£. respectively, and the telegraph and telephone revenue was 614,348£. against an expenditure of 599,762£.

14,517 miles of telegraph line, carrying 48,011 miles of wire, and 17,664 telephone exchange lines were open.

The number of depositors in the Government Savings Bank was 253,353, and the total amount standing to their credit 6,662,829£.

The Union is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent by the Western route, and via Zanzibar and Aden by the Eastern route, and with Australia, India and the Far East, via Mauritius and Cocos.

Marconi Wireless Installations have been established at Cape Town and Durban (Port Natal). The former station has an effective daylight range of 460 and the latter 250 miles; these distances are considerably exceeded in night operations, which have been successfully carried out over more than 1,200 miles.

The rates of postage are:

Customs and Excise.

The four self-governing Colonies prior to the operation of the Act of Union gave notice to the Administrations of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia of their intention to retire from the South African Customs Union Convention in terms of Article xxiii. of that Convention, with effect from 30th June, 1910; and subsequently, on the consummation of the Union of South Africa, an agreement was concluded with these Administrations to continue all the essential features of the previous Customs Convention, which agreement has been subsequently amended to permit of freedom of charges for excise. The effects of the amended agreements are:

(a) The free interchange of the produce and manufactures of the Provinces of the Union, and the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, excepting any goods upon which either Government imposes any excise duties.

(b) The collection by and payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of the duties imposed by the late Convention Tariff on goods intended for consumption in the said Territories, or vice versa, subject to a collecting charge of 5 per cent.; and

(c) The payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of 95 per cent. of the duty collected on imported materials which are contained to an appreciable extent in Union manufactures, and vice versa, entered for removal to the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Union of South Africa, as the case may be.

The Agreement continued in force until the 30th of June, 1911, and thereafter for periods of twelve months, subject to three months' notice by either party of its intention to retire therefrom as from the 30th June following such notice. It now applies to Northern Rhodesia, into which North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia were merged. If, however, either party amend the Customs Tariff, or take any steps in conflict with the spirit and intent of this Agreement, the other is at liberty to retire forthwith.

For like reasons, a Customs Agreement has been entered into between the Government of the Union and His Majesty's High Commissioner on behalf of the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland. The agreement is in all essentials identical to that referred to above, except that instead of a collecting charge of 5 per cent on all duties collected, and the payment of 95 per cent. of any duty collected on imported materials contained in Union manufactures, the basis laid down in Section No. 12 of the South Africa Act, 1909, for the adjustment of duties between the parties to the Agreement is followed, viz.: The Treasury of the Union will pay out quarterly a sum in respect of such duties which shall bear to the total Customs revenue of the Union in each year the same proportion as the average amount of the Customs revenue of such Territories for the three completed financial years last preceding the taking effect of the South Africa Act 1909. The Territories collect their own excise duties on spirits and beer.

The Transvaal Province continues, under the terms of the Transvaal-Mozambique Convention, to admit the products and manufactures of the Province of Mozambique, except spirits, free of duty, but such products and manufactures are liable to the Union import duty if removed to another Province in the Union or to Southern or Northern Rhodesia, or to the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland.
A uniform rate of excise duty now applies throughout the Union on spirits distilled, or beer brewed, within the Union, except in the case of spirits distilled from the products of the sugar-cane, on which, when removed from consumption outside Natal, an additional excise duty is levied.

A rebate of the whole excise duty is granted on methylated spirits, on spirits used in the fortification of pure wine and on spirits exported, and a rebate of part duty on plain spirits used in any art or manufacture.

An excise duty is also levied throughout the Union on acetic and pyroligneous acids, extracts and essences of vinegar.

Excise is levied by means of stamps on cigarettes manufactured in the Union, or in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland, when entered for consumption in the Union, or in these Territories, and an equivalent surtax is levied on imported cigarettes, whether from overseas or from Southern or Northern Rhodesia.

The principle of granting a rebate of Customs duties on all goods the growth or manufacture of the United Kingdom is maintained; likewise of granting such rebate of Customs duties to those British Colonies and Possessions which grant an equivalent rebate to the products and manufactures of the Union of South Africa.

All duties are rebated on goods in transit through any part of the Union to places outside the Union.

The duty paid on bond fide samples of commercial travellers is refunded if the samples are exported within twelve months from the date of importation.

A refund of the duty originally paid will be made on all articles not intended for consumption in the Union imported by bond fide tourists for their use while in the Union provided such articles are exported within six months from the date of importation. As regards tourists' motor cars the triptyque system is in vogue.

Production and Industry.

During the year 1913 there was a continuance of the satisfactory progress in the trade of the Union of South Africa indicated in the figures of last year. The figures of both imports and exports have increased appreciably.

Owing to the continued drought the production of maize was seriously crippled, but the output of most of the other agricultural products has shown no diminution.

The dairying industry, although still in the development stage, made great strides during the year, and was greatly assisted by the carriage free of freight of pedigree stock by the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company. The weight of butter produced was 10,741,745 lbs., and of cheese 520,949 lbs.

Cotton growing increased during the year, it being found that the cotton plant is a better drought resistant than either tobacco or maize. No large quantities were produced, but the price realised was most satisfactory, being from ½d. to 1d. per lb. more on the English market than the American grown varieties.

The sugar crop was unfortunately also adversely affected by the drought, the output being only 92,500 tons against 110,000 tons anticipated.

The production of wattle bark on the other hand, showed signs of healthy vigour, there being 65,050 tons exported, an increase of 12,279 tons over the previous year.

There were 4,497 acres of tea under cultivation during the year, of which 780 acres were abandoned. The net yield of tea was 1,687,729 lbs.

The total value of the output of minerals was £52,924,990, the principal items being as follows:

| Item       | Value     |
|------------|-----------|
| Gold       | £37,374,553 |
| Diamonds  | £11,389,807 |
| Coal       | £2,240,458 |
| Copper     | £507,856   |
| Tin        | £436,550   |
| Lime       | £118,984   |
| Silver     | £115,822   |
| Salt       | £77,142    |
| Asbestos   | £16,028    |

Ostrich feathers and wool were also produced in substantially greater quantities than in the preceding year, the weight of wool exported being 173,242,755 lbs., and of ostrich feathers 1,023,307 lbs.

No statistics in respect of the number of irrigation schemes carried out by individual farmers are available, but the loans advanced thereupon by the Government since Union in 1910 total approximately 700,000l.

There are 43 co-operative schemes, completed or in progress, controlled by Irrigation Boards, and having a total area under command of about 68,000 morgen, and an estimated cost of about 1,000,000l.

The Government schemes are 12 in number, and will, when all are completed, command an area of about 30,000 morgen at a cost of a little over 1,000,000l.

There are, in addition, 3 labour colonies on which about 86,000l. has been advanced by the Government for irrigation purposes, the area commanded being about 7,700 morgen.

76 water drills (6 feet percussion) are at work in various districts of the Union, and during the last year 93 boreholes, aggregating 12,779 feet in depth were drilled, and these yielded a total estimated supply of 1,287,010 gallons and cost practically 14,000l.

Commerce.

The total value of the imports and exports of the Union, exclusive of specie, has been as follows:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1908 | £24,532,520 | £43,910,451 |
| 1909 | £27,355,877 | £49,296,673 |
| 1910 | £36,727,367 | £53,609,340 |

Land Administration.

Union of South Africa.

During the session of 1912 the Union parliament passed a Land Settlement Act (No. 12 of 1912), which provides inter alia, for the purchase by government of private farms for persons able to pay not less than one-fifth of the purchase price of such farms in cash, the remainder of the purchase price plus interest calculated from the date of purchase at the rate of four per cent. per annum, being repayable in forty equal instalments. The Act also provides for the disposal of Crown land, and any land the government may under this Act acquire from private persons, on lease for five years with option of purchase to approved applicants. One important condition of the allotment is that of continuous personal occupation of the land by the lessees. Advances may be made to lessees for the purchase of stock, implements, seeds and other things necessary for the development and working of the holding, but such advances must not exceed 50 per cent. of the total capital expended by a lessee on the improvement of his holding.

The Act lays down the qualifications of intending lessees, and prescribes that they must possess capital sufficient for beneficially developing and working the holding applied for.

Not less than ten years after the date of commencement of a lease, a lessee is entitled to a Crown grant of his own holding, provided the purchase price instalments have been paid and the provisions of the Act have been complied with.

In the Cape Province the area of vacant Crown land is about 17,602,376 morgen; in Natal 367,804 acres surveyed, and 1,615,285 acres unsurveyed. Elsewhere reliable figures are not available. For the present it will be necessary to work under certain of the provincial laws.

Geological Survey.

The geological survey of the Transvaal, together with what was formerly the Cape geological commission, have now been incorporated together as the geological survey of the Union of South Africa, under the direction of H. Kynaston, B.A., director, with A. W. Rogers, B.A., as assistant director.

The field staff are now engaged in the Transvaal, Cape and Natal Provinces, and a special survey of the Witwatersrand Goldfields is also being undertaken.

The publications consist of annual reports, memoirs and maps.

Forests.

The total area reserved for forest purposes in the Union of South Africa is approximately 873,017 morgen (1,843,036 acres). The timbered area is approximately 400,000 acres, of which some 57,000 acres consist of artificial forests termed plantations. The attention of the government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown forests. The Union is divided into seven conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests, stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knysna, Umtata, Pretoria, Maritzburg and Bloemfontein respectively, who is directly responsible to the chief conservator of forests for the Union at Pretoria. The present annual importation of timber into the Union is about 14,000,000 cubic feet, mostly pine, derived from Europe and America, the balance being hardwood from Australia. There is at present a large importation of hardwood sleepers. Expenditure on forests for financial year 1912-13, 118,865l.; cash revenue 71,056l.; value of gratis issues from forest estate, 37,976l.; total revenue 107,031l. Timber removals from forest estate during 1912-13, aggregated 1,252,740 cubic feet.

Instruction.

In the South Africa Act, Section 85 (iii), it is provided that "Education, other than higher education, for a period of five years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides," shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the
respective Provincial Councils. For practical purposes it has been provisionally determined that all post-matriculation instruction shall be deemed to constitute higher education.

The Department of Education, under the Minister, is therefore concerned with:

1. The University of the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Town, established in 1873. It is empowered to grant degrees, but it has no attached teaching institutions.
2. The South African College, Cape Town, founded in 1829.
3. Victoria College, Stellenbosch, incorporated in 1881.
4. Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, incorporated in 1904.
5. Huguenot College, Wellington, incorporated in 1907.
6. Grey University College, Bloemfontein, incorporated in 1910.
7. Transvaal University College, Pretoria, incorporated in 1910.
8. South African School of Mines, and Technology, Johannesburg, incorporated in 1910.
9. Natal University College, Pietermaritzburg, incorporated in 1909.

The department has also under its administration the training of first-class teachers.

The total number of students at the above Colleges in 1913 was 1,322, and the State expenditure on higher education during 1913-14 was £28,254.

Native Affairs.

Cape: The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amaxosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs and others living along the Orange River took up arms against the colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate with a body of police was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up and the special commissioner recalled on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now part of the Cape Province.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve and Noman's Land were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gealekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then commandant of the frontier armed and mounted police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-6 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gealekaland, and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland and Gealekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885, the chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the chief of the Bomvanas. Palir, chief of the Ametshezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pondomisi tribe, under the chiefs Umditshwa and Umhlonho, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus properly aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The port at the St. John's River mouth was annexed to the Colony in 1884, and Customs dues are now levied there under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881.

By Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government.

A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigcau and Nqwiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the chief Nqwiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The District of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now within the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and are grouped under one Chief Magistrate, who is stationed at Umtata, while there are 29 subordinate magistrates. Griqualand East with a population (according to the census of 1911) of 7,944 Europeans, 236,574 Bantu, 4,520 mixed, has nine magistrates; Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, with a population of 8,148 Europeans, 226,087 Bantu, 1,821 mixed, has seven magistrates; Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gealekaland, with population of 2,188 Europeans, 186,318 Bantu, 209 mixed, has six magistrates; Pondoland, comprising East and West Pondoland and Port St. John's, with a population of 1,386 Europeans, 231,682 Bantu, 1,249 mixed, has seven magistrates.

Natal and Zululand.—In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was despatched against the tribe and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "Native..."
Law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch law and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters; a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime, Mala in se. This system of Government remains in operation at the present time, under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11, of 1865; but at the same time and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may, in certain cases, apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A Law No. 26 of 1875, established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts.

As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work so well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875, the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903, to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust for occupation by natives is about 2,400,000 acres, the land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

Defence.

The South African Defence Act, 1912, became law on the 14th of June, 1912.

This Act provides for the establishment of Defence Forces, comprising:

1. a Permanent Force,
2. a Coast Garrison Force,
3. a Citizen Force,
4. a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and
5. Special Reserves.

Every citizen between the ages of 17 and 60 is liable to render personal service in time of war and those between 21 and 25 are liable to undergo a prescribed peace training with the Active Citizen Force spread over a period of four consecutive years. The Act states, however, that only 50 per cent. of the total number liable to peace training shall actually undergo that training unless Parliament makes financial provision for the training of a greater number.

The establishment of Rifle Associations is a marked feature of the Act; citizens between the ages of 21 and 25 who are not entered for peace training with the Active Citizen Force are to be compelled to undergo training during these four years in a Rifle Association, thus ensuring that, in course of time, all citizens will at least know how to handle and use a rifle.

Provision is also made in the Act for the cadet training of boys between 13 and 17 in urban and other populous areas where facilities can conveniently be arranged.

Existing Militia and Volunteer units established under the late Colonial Governments have been embodied in the Active Citizen Force.

The permanent force—South African Mounted Riflemen—was established on the 1st April, 1913, and the training of the personnel for the permanent batteries has been undertaken and the training commenced.

The Union has been divided into 15 military districts. To each military district has been allotted various units of different arms, to which the citizens entered for peace training in their 20th and 21st years are now to be posted.

The establishments of units have been fixed, regulations have been prepared, and the Cape Garrison Artillery has been constituted as the First Division of the South African Garrison Artillery, and a movable armament company of Garrison Artillery has been formed at Durban by the transfer of the personnel of two batteries of the late Field Artillery Militia of Natal.

A cadet organization is always in existence, and Rifle Associations have been formed.

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PROVINCE.

Extent and Boundaries.
The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Province of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, and on the north-east by the Orange Free State and Natal Provinces. The Cape Province, with the Transkei, contains an area of 276,985 square miles, being over five times that of England. It extends from 26 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.
Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Hol- lam's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876, three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walfish Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the Colony by proclamation dated 7th August, 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tumbokieland, Bomvanaland, and Goalekaland, of which, by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed Governor. By proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1883, issued under Act 3 of 1883, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayliff") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1894 the whole of Pondoland was annexed. Basutoland, now an independent Colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indianman, the Haarlem, was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeek, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonisation. Following these migratory colonists, a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1743, and another at Graaff Reiniet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III., c. II.) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress, owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted.

An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonisation as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of £50,000 to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated, and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonisation of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:

(1.) General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question.
(2.) Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war.
(3.) Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London,
which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion, preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in recent years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Area and Population.

The following table gives the area and population of the Province and native territories according to the final census returns of 1911:

| Province of the Cape of Good Hope | Population in 1911 | Total |

Constitution and Government.

The Colony of the Cape of Good Hope was originally founded by the Dutch in the year 1652. Great Britain took possession of it in 1795, but evacuated it in 1803. A British force again took possession in 1806, and the Colony has remained a British Possession since that date. It was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Convention of London, August 13th, 1814. The original Colony has been extended from time to time. East and West Pondoland were annexed in 1894 and Bechuanaland in 1895. For many years the form of Government in the Colony depended on the terms of the Royal Letters Patent and Instructions to Governors. Letter Patent issued in 1850 to Governor Sir Henry Smith declared that in the Colony there should be a Parliament which should consist of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly.

A Constitution Ordinance was enacted by Order in Council of March 11th, 1883, and took effect on May 1st ensuing. This Order in Council provided that nothing it contained should prevent the Parliament of the Colony from making Acts (subject to the power of Her Majesty in Council either to disallow or assent to such Acts) in amendment of the said Ordinance. This power of amending the Constitution was exercised from time to time as the bounds of the Colony were extended. In 1872 an Act was passed at the Cape and assented to by Order of the Council providing for the system of Executive Administration known as Responsible Government. The Constitution formed under these various Acts vested the Executive in the Governor and an Executive Council, composed of certain office holders appointed by the Crown. On the 31st May, 1910, the Colony was merged in the Union.
of South Africa, thereafter forming an original Province of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Provincial Administration.

The Colony is divided into 119 Magisterial districts, and the Colony proper, including Bechuanaland, but exclusive of the Transkeian territories, into 85 Fiscal Divisions. In each Division there is a Civil Commissioner, who is, in all cases where the Fiscal and Magisterial areas coincide, also the Resident Magistrate. Each Division has a Council of at least six members (18 in the Cape Division), elected triennially by the owners or occupiers of immovable property. These Councils look after roads, boundaries and beacons; return three members to the Licensing Court, and perform other local duties.

There are 121 Municipalities, each governed by a Mayor, or Chairman and Councillors, a certain number of whom are elected annually by the ratepayers. There are also 83 Village Management Boards.

The Colony is divided into 121 School Districts, each under the control of a School Board, two-thirds of the members being locally elected, and one-third nominated partly by Government and partly by Municipal or Divisional Councils. Education is compulsory for children of European extraction in 120 School Board Districts. The necessary grants are provided from the general revenue, broadly speaking on the £ for £ principle, to supplement local contributions of at least equal amount which are raised by means of school fees and a local rate, not exceeding 4d. per £1 on the capital value of rateable property.

Aided schools, June 30th, 1914, 4,440; enrolment, 234,848; attendance, 202,456. There are 94,880 European pupils and 134,250 non-European. Total number of teachers, 8,919.

Provincial expenditure on Education (excluding Higher Education which is under the control of the Central Government), 1910-11, £558,738; 1911-12, £635,423; 1912-13, £785,051; 1913-14, £853,448.

In the hospitals and kindred charitable institutions 13,920 patients were treated in the year 1913. There is no system of Poor Law Relief, but 863 persons received Indoor Relief during the year, and 5,391 received Outdoor Relief.

In 1911, 1,712,250 acres of crown lands were alienated, the amount realised being £2,015/. Up to December, 1911, the total area disposed of was about 140,000,000 acres, the quantity undisposed of being 35,964,664 acres.

According to the census taken on the 7th May, 1911, there were 974,266 morgen* of land under cultivation, 376,873 morgen lay fallow and 58,058,667 morgen were used for grazing purposes.

The following crops were grown, on the areas specified:—Wheat, 230,916 morgen; oats 238,113 morgen; barley, 43,002 morgen; maize, 115,394 morgen; kafr corn, 9,206 morgen; rye, 43,097 morgen; peas and beans, 1,929 morgen; potatoes, 9,776 morgen; sweet potatoes, 3,385 morgen; pumpkins, 7,128 morgen; onions, 911 morgen; mangel and beet, 1,102 morgen; tobacco, 2,084 morgen; lucerne, 61,174 morgen; paspalum and other imported grasses, 7,054 morgen. In addition small areas of ground nuts, sugar-cane, tea and manna were grown. There were also 16,525 morgen of vineyards, 18,094 of orchards and 5,942 morgen of vegetable gardens.

From the above areas (which include Bechuanaland and the Transkei) the following produce was obtained:—Wheat, 1,305,006 muids; oats, 1,228,927 muids; oat-hay, 294,650,490 lbs.; barley (grain), 373,509 muids; barley (cut green), 5,049,583 bundles; maize, 1,727,864 muids; kafr corn, 299,422 muids; rye, 169,287 muids; peas and beans, 144,132 muids; potatoes, 414,674 muids; sweet potatoes, 249,662 muids; pumpkins, 7,082,293; onions, 105,963 muids; mangel and beet, 669,417 muids; tobacco, 3,767,179 lbs.; lucerne, 100,233 tons; paspalum and other imported grasses, 6,913 tons. (A muid of wheat, maize, peas or beans, weighs 200 lbs; oats, potatoes, and sweet potatoes, 150 lbs; barley, 160 lbs.; onions, 120 lbs.) Of wine, 7,488,987 gallons were produced, and 617,040 gallons of brandy. The total grape crop amounted to 5,695,970 bushel baskets.

In 1911, there were 2,715,330 cattle, 333,962 horses, 17,134,513 sheep, 7,953,414 goats, 565,730 pigs, 47,059 mules, 191,086 asses, and 728,087 ostriches.

Some irrigation works have been or are being executed, and surveys are in progress for new works. The alluvial lands are of no great area, and the difficulties in the way of irrigation are considerable.

The sheep-farms (mostly owned by the occupiers) are from 3,000 to 15,000 acres and upwards; those in tillage are comparatively small.

* One morgen is equivalent to 2·11654 English acres.

### Money, Weights and Measures.

The coins and the standard weights and measures are British, but the following old Dutch measures are still used: Liquid Measure: Leaguer = about 128 imperial gallons; half aum = 15½ imperial gallons; anker = 7½ imperial gallons. Capacity: muid = 3 bushels. The general surface measure is Morgen, equal to 2·1165402 acres; 1,000 Cape lineal feet are equal to 1,033 British imperial feet. Recently a Bill was introduced to provide for the standardization of the metric system for weights and measures, with the optional use of imperial standards, except in the case of chemists, who are compelled to use the metric system.

Fisheries.

This subject has been engaging the attention of the Cape Provincial Government since the inception of Union.

Under the Fisheries Ordinance which was passed in 1911, regulations were promulgated providing for the better protection of both sea and fresh-water fish. Fishing boats employed for purposes of profit are now licensed and registered, and a licence is also necessary before trout can be caught in any of the public waters of the Cape Province.

The license fee to catch Trout is 10s. during the open season, which is, in the case of the Western Area, including all Divisions situate West of the Eastern boundaries of the Divisions of Knysna, George, Oudtshoorn, Prince Albert, Beaufort West, Victoria West, Bristown and Hope Town; (1) in the case of rivers, between the 1st day of October in any year and the 15th day of January in the following year, both days inclusive, and from the 1st April to the 31st May in each year except in the Eerste River, Division of Stellenbosch, where the open season shall remain from 1st October to 15th January, and (2) in the case of vlei, between the 15th day of September in any year and the 31st day of March in the following year, both days inclusive; and in the Eastern Area including the Transkeian Territories and all Divisions situate East of the boundary of the Western portion of the Province as defined above, between the 1st day of October in any year to the 30th day of April in the following year, both days inclusive.

Scientific investigations into the habits and spawning seasons of various kinds of fish are also carried on at the Aquarium at St. James, under the direction of Dr. Gilchrist, Fishery Adviser to the Cape Provincial Government.

PROVINCE OF NATAL.

Area and Population.

Natal* derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from Cape Town, and between the 26th

* There was formerly another British settlement named Natal, a factory of the East India Company on the west coast of Sumatra, founded 1751, and not finally abandoned until the cession of Sumatra to the Dutch in 1821.
and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange Free State and Basutoland, and on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and Umtamvuna River. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. Pietermaritzburg is the seat of the Provincial Government, and has a population of 29,980, exclusive of H.M.'s troops; the largest town and only port is Durban.

The Province (including Zululand, 10,424 square miles) has an area of 35,290 square miles, with a seaboard of about 360 miles. The climate is sub-tropical on the coast and somewhat colder inland. It is well suited to Europeans. The Province is divided into 40 Magisterial Divisions.

The European population has more than trebled since 1879. The returns of the total population in 1891, 1901 and at the Censuses of April 17th, 1904, and May 7th, 1911, were:

| Year | Europeans | Indians | Asiatics | Natives |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1891 | 46,788    | 63,821  | 97,109   | 89,114  |
| 1901 | 63,821    | 74,385  | 100,918  | 133,439 |
| 1904 | 97,109    | 100,918 | 110,727* | 962,490*|
| 1911 | 89,114    |         |          |         |

1 Including in 1904, 6,686 "mixed" and others.
2 Including 3,774 British troops and their dependents, in 1904.
3 Including 9,092 mixed and other coloured.

The figures for 1891 exclude Zululand; those for 1904 and 1911 include the districts of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, and Ngotshe. The number of males in 1911 was 564,648 and of females, 629,395.

Population of the borough of Durban according to the Census of May 7th, 1911, 60,187 consisting of Europeans 31,783, natives 17,774, Indians, Asiatics and other Coloured 19,630, and of Pietermaritzburg 30,553, consisting of 14,737 Europeans, 7,789 Indians, Asiatics and other Coloured, 8,029 natives.

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonise it. Tshaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingana, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Tshaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Boers obtained a decisive victory, and placed Mpande, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingana, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the South African Republic (as the Transvaal was at that time called) and Orange Free State on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other, Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and a Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotshe, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,754 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 45 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas: total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,970 square miles.

Zululand and Tongaland.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Tshaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Tshaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingana in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Mpande. In the latter years of Mpande Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Mpande's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetshwayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as
regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetshwayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetshwayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetshwayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetshwayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetshwayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inyenezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginhlovu on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetshwayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetshwayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Tshaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetshwayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatuze River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatuze and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetshwayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutus (the name by which the personal adherents of Cetshwayo—as distinct from the Zulus in general—were known), finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinuzulu, a son of Cetshwayo, as King; but it was soon checked, with the assistance of the Imperial troops, and Dinuzulu with his uncles Ndabuko and Tshingana were arrested, tried and convicted of high treason, and removed to St. Helena, while other offenders were tried on other charges, and imprisoned or fined. Dinuzulu and
his two uncles were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1898.

In 1890 Tongaland and the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Mhikiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Tongaland, also called Maputaland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongolo with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Tongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

In 1906 a serious native rebellion broke out in the colony and spread to Zululand. It was suppressed by the Colonial forces, with assistance from detachments of volunteers from the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. A Commission was appointed to enquire into the native question generally, and the Commission's Report has since been published.

In 1907 there was a further recrudescence of unrest amongst the natives in Zululand, which was, however, easily suppressed without actual bloodshed. Dinuzulu, son of Cetshwayo, together with other chiefs and ringleaders, was arrested, and tried on charges of high treason, rebellion, sedition, murder, etc., and found guilty, though complicity in the murders of several noted loyalist Chiefs was not proved as against Dinuzulu. Dinuzulu was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, whilst other Chiefs were sentenced for longer periods and transported to St. Helena. It was generally believed that prompt action was the means of arresting what might have been a very serious conflagration.

**Constitution.**

Natal, which had been annexed to Cape Colony in 1844, was placed under separate government in 1845, and under charter of July 15, 1856, was erected into a separate Colony. By this charter partially representative institutions were established, and, under a Natal Act of 1893, assented to by Order in Council June 26, 1893, the Colony obtained responsible government. The province of Zululand was annexed to Natal on December 30th, 1897. The districts of Vryheid, Utrecht and part of Wakkerstroom, formerly belonging to the Transvaal, were in January, 1903, annexed to the colony. On May 31, 1910, the Colony was merged in the Union of South Africa, becoming an original province of the Union.

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, Dundee, and Vryheid, and local boards in Verulam, Greytown, Utrecht, Estcourt, Charlestown, Weenen, Harding, Paulpietersburg, South Shepstone, and South Barrow. Their total revenue in 1911 was £847,943l., their expenditure £781,537l., and their debt £3,992,371l.

**Instruction.**

With the exception of Higher Education, which has been placed under the control of the Union Government, Education comes under the Provincial Administration. There are 2 Government high schools, 2 Government preparatory schools, 63 Government primary schools, 2 Government art schools, 5 Government Indian schools, 2 Government schools for coloured children, besides 108 Government-aided schools, and 151 Government-aided farmhouse schools for European children. Also there are 2 technical institutes, 36 Indian schools, 267 Native schools, and 17 coloured schools, all of which receive Government aid; and a considerable number of private schools in the province. Three of the aided schools are secondary schools for girls. The aggregate number of European pupils in regular attendance at the Government and inspected schools was 17,093 for 1913; the average daily attendance 86 per cent. of the number on the registers. At the Government high and preparatory schools there is an average daily attendance of 898 pupils. About 1,500 children attend private unaided schools, and it is estimated that only a small percentage of white children are receiving no education. The number of European children receiving gratuitous education in 1913 was 3,004. The direct Government expenditure on Government schools for 1913 was £109,118l. (excluding expenditure for furniture and buildings, but including maintenance). Fees paid by pupils in Government schools for 1913 amounted to £21,655l. The 267 Government-aided schools for natives had a total enrolment of 20,018, and received in 1913 grants in aid to the amount of £17,304l.; and the 36 Government-aided schools for the children of Indians had a total enrolment of 3,967 in 1913, for which a grant of £4,980l. was expended.

**Finance.**

Since the coming into effect of the Union there is only one financial statement for the four provinces together. Particulars are given above under the Union. Since the passing of the Financial Relations Act, No. 10, 1913, the provincial revenue is made up of an amount voted by Parliament by way of subsidy and certain revenue transferred or assigned.

**Production and Industry.**

On the coast and in Zululand there are large plantations of sugar and tea, while cereals of all kinds (especially maize), fruits, vegetables, the *Acacia mollissima* or Black Wattle (the bark of which is so much used for tanning purposes), and other crops grow prolifically. The leading crops for export are sugar, tea, maize and wattle bark. The production of maize in 1911 was 1,805,745 muidas (of 200 lbs.); of tea, 5,007,090 lbs.; of sugar, 79,633 tons; and of tobacco, 2,685,037 lbs. The live stock in 1911 numbered 75,567 horses, 456,087 cattle, 1,519,258 sheep, 989,274 goats, 110,332 pigs, 15,602 mules, 28,018 asses, and 4,111 ostriches.
The Province is rich in mineral wealth, and while the coal industry is advancing several gold mines on a small scale are worked. During the year 1913 the output of coal and gold was as follows:—Coal, 2,898,726 tons, valued at £891,699; gold (fine), 347 ozs., valued at £1,473. The average number of persons employed at coal mines in 1913 was 11,867.

Among the valuable minerals known to exist in the Province are asbestos, copper ore, fireclay, gold, graphite, gypsum, iron ore, lead and silver ore, limestone and marble, manganese ore, mica, molybdenum ore, nickel ore, nitre, oil shale, and tin ore.

A whaling industry exists at Durban, and is carried on by six companies. In 1913 the number of whales killed and landed was 602 humpbacks, 59 blue, 3 right, 263 finbacks, 230 sperm, 1 sei, and 126 unclassified.

**PROVINCE OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE.**

**Situation, Area, and Population.**

The Province of the Orange Free State lies to the north of the Orange River and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and the Province of Natal. The country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains: but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain raised in parts.

The area of the province is 50,389 square miles; it is divided into 24 districts. The population at the last three censuses was as follows:—
2,808; No religion (so stated) 173,336, of whom 173,192 were natives and other coloured persons.

History.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Moshesh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the inrush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa. On the establishment of Responsible Government, July, 1907, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams became Governor of the Colony.

On the restoration of peace in 1902 Crown Colony Government was established, and continued till 30th June, 1907, when Responsible Government was granted. The election of the first Legislative Assembly took place in November, 1907.

The Legislature consisted of two Chambers—a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly, consisting of 11 and 39 members respectively.

On the 31st May, 1910, the Orange River Colony became, under the name of the Orange Free State, a Province of the Union of South Africa, and is now governed in terms of the South Africa Act which constituted the Union of South Africa. Apart from the general control of the Union Parliament the Act provided that the control of certain specified matters should be vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Education.

Higher education is under the control of the Minister of Education for the Union, while primary (including elementary) and secondary education is controlled by the Administrator of the Province. Under the School Act of 1908 the Province is divided into a number of School Districts. Each Government School is under the supervision of a School Committee elected by the parents. For each District there is also a School Board, appointed partly by the School Committees and partly by the Government, which exercises general supervision over all schools within its district. The School Committees have the right of nominating teachers, subject to the approval of the Department. Grants are given conditionally to private schools. At present there are about 900 Government or Government-aided schools in the Province with a total enrolment of about 30,000. Fees are charged at all schools, exemption being granted under certain prescribed regulations, and attendance is compulsory up to Standard VI. Except where the parent objects, both official languages are taught to all children and where possible are used as equal media of instruction.

Bloemfontein is the chief educational centre, and contains the following institutions:—

(a) Primary and Secondary Education.—Grey College School, a boys' high school, with about 300 pupils; the Eunice High School for Girls, with about 350 pupils; the Brehner School, a mixed primary school, with about 550 pupils; a Model School in connection with the Normal College, and two infant schools. These six are Government schools, Grey College School and the Eunice High School having large boarding departments. The "Oranje" School is a Government-aided school; the Convent School and St. Michael's Home are private schools, all three being girls' schools with large boarding departments.

(b) Training of Teachers.—The Normal School, established soon after the war, has been repla
by the Normal College, where some 50 to 60 students take out the Third Year of the Training Course prescribed by the Classification of Schools and Teachers' Act of 1913, a limited number receiving a more advanced training. The First and Second years of the Course are taken out at the two High Schools and the Oranje Meisjes School, as also at various secondary schools throughout the country, the total number of students being about 120.

The Polytechnic College, established in 1912, trains teachers in Art and Technical subjects (music, painting, art needlework, dressmaking, cookery, etc.). The classes are also open for general students.

(c) Industrial Education.—The Home Industries Board directs various spinning and weaving schools throughout the country and is responsible for this department of the Polytechnic College. The Government Industrial School for boys was opened in 1907. The numbers are between 50 and 60, all resident and apprenticed to various trades. Saddle and harness-making, carpentry, smithwork, etc., are taught in the institution itself, while engineering, printing, painting, etc., are taught in various local workshops. The Preparatory Technical School gives instruction in basket-making and similar industries in addition to the ordinary elementary school course.

Secondary schools have been established in all the leading towns of the Province with more advanced departments, preparing pupils up to University Matriculation Standard. In connection with five of these schools the Normal Training Course (First and Second years) has been established, as mentioned above. Several industrial schools have also been instituted.

The gross expenditure on education for the financial year 1913-14 was approximately 310,000l. This sum does not include the cost of construction of educational buildings.

Production and Industry.

The Province consists of undulating plains, affording excellent grazing and wide tracts for agricultural purposes. The rainfall is moderate. The country is still mainly devoted to stock-farming, although a rapidly increasing quantity of grain is being raised, especially in the eastern districts. At 31st December, 1913, there were 10,060,053 sheep and 616,113 goats.

TRANSVAAL PROVINCE.

Situation Area and Population.

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange Free State Province and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and by the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal Province at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22°S. degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea.

The area of the Province is 110,426 square miles, divided into 24 districts. The census of May 7, 1911, showed for the Transvaal a population amounting to 1,686,212 of whom 971,555 were males, and 714,657 females. The population comprised 420,562 Europeans or whites, 1,219,845 natives and 45,805 other coloured races. In 1912 there were 19,876 European births, and 16,753 deaths. The white population of Pretoria in 1911 was 29,618. The largest town is Johannesburg, the mining centre of Witwatersrand goldfields, with a population (1911) of 237,104 consisting of 119,953 whites and 117,151 coloured.
**History.**

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British Government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1838, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession, and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagoa Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1875, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000£ in Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,000£ were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetshwayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuanas chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; a guerilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.

The annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shepstone at the time had with him but a few mounted policemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not arrive in the province for some time after the English Government had been set up, with the apparent acquiescence of its people. But subsequently hostile feelings towards the annexation were widely manifested, and two deputations were sent to England after annexation, to represent those who were opposed to that measure and desired a withdrawal of the British Government. In each case the answer of Her late Majesty's Government was a decided refusal.

In December, 1880, a majority of the Boers took up arms against the Government, and hoisted the flag of the South African Republic at Heidelberg. The towns held by Imperial troops were immediately invested, and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, which was being withdrawn from Lydenburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force at headquarters, was surprised, and after suffering very heavy loss, compelled to surrender. The towns, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy Colley, without waiting for reinforcements, collected the small force at his disposal and advanced from Pietermaritzburg in Natal to relieve them. A large force of Boers opposed his entry into the Transvaal at Laing's Nek, the path across the Drakensberg mountains.

On the 28th of January the English troops made a gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but they were driven back with heavy loss. The Boers followed up this advantage by cutting off Sir G. Colley's communications with Newcastle, with a view to prevent his receiving the reinforcements which had been sent out, and were now on the way up. To re-open his communications he crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked by the Boers. The action continued all day; at nightfall the Boers drew off, and the English forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being made by President Brand, of the Orange Free State, to bring about an understanding, and in reply to the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's Government, they declared that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition to the English troops, a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of all difficulties. This message was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent unopened to the headquarters of the Boers at Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to General Colley that no definite answer could be given to the message from Her Majesty's Government until Mr. Kruger's views were known. Dr.
Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the 26th of February, General Colley, having received no reply to his message, moved out with three hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss, while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped, the rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Sir G. Pomeroy Colley himself was killed by a bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood, who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the advance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of President Brand, an interview took place on the 6th of March between him and General Joubert, who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek, which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice, with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr. Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E. Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's Government should allow the Transvaal self-government as regards its own interior affairs; that the control and management of the foreign relations of the State should be reserved to Her Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident. The functions of this officer, and the provisions for the protection of the interests of the native population, were to be determined by Her Majesty's Government on the recommendation of a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to consider the whole question of the settlement of the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand was invited to be present at the conferences of the Commissioners with the representatives of the Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The sittings of the Commission were opened on the 28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recommendations of the Commission were submitted in detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the result a Convention was framed embodying the terms of the peace agreement, assigning the boundaries of the State, defining the functions of the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-general and chargé d'affaires, and conferring upon him extensive powers for the protection of the interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also formed the medium of communication between the Government of the Transvaal and the native States on its borders. Stipulations were made for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-commission, composed of the two judges of the High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident, was appointed to consider claims for compensation for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of August, and on the 8th of that month the Government was handed over to the representatives of the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Convention, and constant trouble occurred on the border, especially on the South-Western border, where the Bechuana land tribes suffered severely from the incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal, which the Transvaal Government entirely failed to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to account by acquiring fresh territory in violation of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her Majesty's Government yielded to representations of the Transvaal Government and granted a new Convention, which was signed in London on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, became of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs, the Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX., to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen."

"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, factories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuana land, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial
difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention.

The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to 177,877L., had risen in 1890 to 1,223,061L., reaching 3,329,958L. in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time; other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1896 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifts by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1895, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his mediation Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances, and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens' Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1898, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiators. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 10th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic, and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volksraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop (this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state); (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years'
offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years' basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years' franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years' franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

After some correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 20th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslaagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnaissance from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Capetown for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R. Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chieveloe after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enslin, and on the 28th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.

The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronje was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.

The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post
of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brebner, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions.

His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7), placing subsidised schools under the control of the Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (35, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation being accordingly by Ordinance.

On the 31st March, 1903, Letters Patent were passed providing for the constitution of a
Legislative Assembly to consist of the Lieut.-Governor and not less than six or more than nine official members, and (provisionally) not less than thirty or more than thirty-five elected members. But in December, 1906, this Constitution was revoked and a new one substituted.

On 6th December, 1906, Letters Patent were issued conferring full responsible government upon the Transvaal. The legislature consisted of two chambers, the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the former containing fifteen members and the latter sixty-nine.

The Transvaal was included as an original Province of the Union of South Africa in terms of the South Africa Act, 1909, which came into operation on the 31st May, 1910, and is now governed under that Act. Apart from the general control of the Parliament of the Union, the control of certain matters specified in the South Africa Act is vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Municipal Government.

Municipal Government was established in the principal towns of the Province by Ordinances enacted in 1903. These Ordinances were extended and amended during the years 1904-1909 inclusive, and were during the 1912 session of the Provincial Council consolidated and further amended so as to give local authorities more extensive powers, principally in regard to matters affecting the public health, although other important amendments, e.g., the basis of the municipal franchise, and the principle of councillors contracting with Councils, were incorporated in the consolidating and amending Ordinances. Three Ordinances were enacted dealing with:

(a) the constitution of Local Authorities, i.e., Town and Village Councils and Health Committees, and the powers and duties of such bodies;
(b) the election of councillors, and
(c) the levying of assessment rates.

Under these Ordinances, as under previous legislation, the Provincial Administration retains some measures of control over the government of Municipalities, limited, however, to powers of audit and surcharge, the approval of loan proposals, local improvement schemes and the alienation of Municipal property. There are now 37 Municipalities in the Province and considerable progress in the improvement of the towns has been made since the inauguration of local self-government.

In areas under the jurisdiction of Town Councils the Municipal franchise under the Ordinance is extended to all white persons, being British subjects, of over the age of 21 years who:

(1) own rateable property of the assessed value of 100l.; or
(2) occupy rateable property within the Municipality of the assessed value of 300l. and who have resided within the Municipality for a period of six months; or
(3) who have resided in the Municipality for a period of 12 months;

and Councillors will be required to hold the following alternative qualifications:

(a) ownership of fixed property to the value of 250l.; or
(b) occupation of property within the Municipality to the value of 500l. and residence within the Municipality for a period of twelve months.

In areas under the jurisdiction of village Councils the qualification of voters and Councillors is occupation of and residence in premises within the Municipality of the gross annual value of 6l. and upwards or ownership of immovable property in the Municipality in respect of which assessment rates or erf taxes are payable. Aliens or coloured British subjects are not eligible to vote, to sit on Town or Village Councils, or to become members of Health Committees. Women are not eligible as Town or Village Councillors though competent to vote at elections of such bodies.

The election of councillors of the various Municipalities under the control of Town Councils is according to the principle of proportional representation, the system used being commonly known as that of the "single transferable vote." In Village Council areas elections are by ballot, a simple form of procedure being followed.

Legislation enacted in 1905 and 1906 provided for the creation of Health Committees where the density of population made it necessary in semi-urban areas for sanitary measures to be enforced. Eleven of these committees have been established. Provision is now made in the Local Government Ordinance of 1912 for the constitution of such bodies and wider powers of control are delegated to them under that Ordinance.

The 3 Normal Colleges had 161 enrolled students. There are 251 native schools, which have 14,741 pupils. The number of pupils in secondary schools on December 31st, 1912, was 2,425.

Production and Industry.

The Province of the Transvaal is in the main a stock-raising country, though there are considerable areas well adapted for agriculture including the growing of tropical crops. The maize and tobacco crops may be regarded as the most important. The production of maize in 1911 was 3,310,613 muids (of 200 lbs.) of tobacco, 7,701,774 lbs.; of potatoes, 411,150 muids (150 lbs.); barley, 12,381 muids (160 lbs.); oats, 155,067 muids (150 lbs.); oat-bay, 108,163,902 lbs. (No later agricultural statistics available).

At 31st December, 1913, there were 5,024,808 sheep and 2,104,527 goats.

HIGH COMMISSION.

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa was created by Letters Patent in 1878. In 1879 a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland; but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who was also Governor of Natal (which now includes Zululand and Amatongaland). The High Commissioner for South Africa, who, under the Commission of 1889, was the officer for the time being administering the Crown in all matters occurring in South Africa beyond the limits of the Colonies properly so called. He was, till 1899, charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, as well as those with native states and tribes outside the Colonies of the Cape and Natal, including Swaziland, which was administered by the Government of the South African Republic under the Convention of 1894.

The High Commissioner is Governor of Basutoland, and supervises the affairs of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and of Swaziland, and exercises the control provided by Order in Council over the Administration of the British South Africa Company in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898, and the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1911, provide respectively for a control by the High Commissioner over legislation, important appointments, and Native affairs in Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, who is paid from Imperial funds and acts as the local representative of the High Commissioner and the Imperial Government. The office of High Commissioner, which was formerly held by the Governor of Cape Colony, was, by a Commission dated Oct. 6th, 1900, vested in Lord Milner, by a similar Commission, dated March 15th, 1905, in Lord Selborne, by a similar Commission, dated March 30th, 1910, in Lord Gladstone, and by a similar Commission, dated May 14th, 1914, in Lord Buxton, who is also Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.

BASUTOLAND.

Situation and Area.

Basutoland forms an irregular oval in the north-east of the Cape Colony; the main axis, about 150 miles in length, lying in a north-easterly direction. The Orange Free State Province, Natal and the Cape Province form its boundaries. Its area is 11,716 square miles, or nearly as large as Belgium.

It lies between 29 and 30 degrees south lat., and between 27 and 28 degrees east long.

Description and Climate.

The territory, which is well watered, and enjoys an excellent climate, is the finest grain-producing country in South Africa, and the abundant grass
enables the Basutos to rear immense herds of cattle. The scenery is grand, and in many parts extremely beautiful.

The Maluti Mountains, forming a part of the great Drakensberg chain, occupy most of the country, which is really one continuous elevated plateau, though broken and rugged. The extension of arable culture has tended to drive the cattle more and more into the high ground. The range of temperature during the year 1906-1907 was from a maximum of 93° F. to a minimum of 11° F., while the mean temperature for the year was 58.76° F. The rainfall for 1906-7 was 41.49 inches.

The climate is perfect for Europeans and natives alike, and when more easily reached the country will prove a great health resort. Its high altitude and pure atmosphere prove most invigorating. Phthisis pulmonalis is almost unknown except among the section of natives who have taken to wearing clothes, and Europeans who have come to the country on account of their disease. The latter in early stages of the disease improve at once. Persons suffering from malarial fever or its result are benefited greatly by a short residence in Basutoland. Leprosy imported from the Orange River Colony and Cape Colony has now a firm hold in the country, the proportion being about 91 per 1,000. As yet it has been possible to do little to check the spread of the disease. With the authority of H.E. the High Commissioner, a Leper Settlement was formed in 1912, about 4 miles from Maseru for the segregation and care of all lepers within the Territory.

Population and Industry.

In 1875 when Basutoland formed part of the Cape Colony, at the general census of the Colony taken in that year, the European population of Basutoland was 499, and the native 127,707. At the census of 1901 the population was estimated at 647 Europeans and 263,400 natives.

Maseru, the capital, and largest town, has a population of 861 natives and 500 whites (these figures are unaudited returns).

The productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron and copper, and coal has been found and used in some parts.

History.

The Basutos appear to have been composed of the remnants of several tribes which were broken up in the wars waged by Moselikatze, the king of the Matabele, in the early years of the last century. These remnants were united in about 1818 under Moshesh, a chief of great ability, who ruled for many years.

In 1832 war broke out between Moshesh and the British Government; the Basutos were defeated by Sir G. Cathcart at the battle of the Berea Mountain, and Moshesh sent in his submission, and made peace.

A few years later, in 1856, disputes arose between Moshesh and the Orange Free State respecting boundary questions, and hostilities resulted which lasted from 1856 to 1858, with indecisive results, and were concluded by the Treaty of Aliwal, 1858, but collisions frequently recurred.

In 1865 the war broke out afresh, and Moshesh again claimed the protection of the Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse. He declined to interpose actively, but despatched a British Commissioner to Thaba Bosigo, the capital of Basutoland, to settle the difficulties. This measure met with little success, and in the end the Boers were successful, and Moshesh sued for peace. At the treaty of Thaba Bosigo, April, 1866, he recognised the permanent cession of a portion of his district and acknowledged himself a subject of the Orange Free State.

The peace was of short duration, the war was renewed, and the Basutos, pressed by the Boers, were on the brink of destruction, when they again appealed to be taken under the authority of the Queen, and in January, 1868, Sir Philip Wodehouse received authority to recognise Moshesh and his tribe as British subjects, and for the incorporation of their territory. This was carried into effect by a proclamation dated March 12th, 1868.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition, until it was annexed to the Cape, by an Act of the Cape Legislature, No. 12 of 1871. The Act expressly declared that Basutoland was not to be subject to the general law of the Colony, and gave the Governor power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend to it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein.

The subsequent history of Basutoland was one of much trouble and disturbance.

In March, 1879, Moirosi, the chief of the Quithing district, in the south-east of Basutoland, rescued from justice his son Doda, who had been arrested for horse-stealing; and, on the Colonial authorities demanding his surrender, broke out into open defiance of its authority. Owing to the great natural strength of his country and stronghold, considerable difficulty was experienced in subduing him; but in December of that year his stronghold was carried by storm, and he himself fell in the assault. The proposals of the Colonial Government to divide the territory occupied by the adherents of this chief into lots for occupation by European settlers gave rise to great discontent among the Basutos who had remained loyal. This discontent was further increased by the extension of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, providing for a general disarmament, to Basutoland by proclamation in April, 1880, and culminated in the revolt of almost the whole tribe when an attempt was made to put the Act in force. The rebellion spread to the native territories east and south of Basutoland, East Griqualand, Tambookieland, and the Pondomisi, where the rising was signalled by the treacherous murder of Mr. Hope, the magistrate, and other Europeans.

Strenuous efforts were made by the Colony to reduce the Basutos to submission by force of arms, but without decisive success, though the loss of their cattle, and the interruption of cultivation, caused great distress amongst them. Early in 1881 overtures for an arrangement were made by the leading chiefs, and, at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, the High Commissioner acted as arbiter between the Colonial Government and the Basutos.

The terms of his award were, the registration of arms, the payment of compensation to those natives who had remained loyal by the tribe, and also the payment of a fine of 5,000 head of cattle. The award, was accepted by the Basutos and the fine
paid, but little was done towards fulfilling the other conditions. The Colonial Ministry, with a view to facilitate a settlement, cancelled the award and induced the Cape Parliament to assume the burden of compensating the loyalists. The Disarmament Proclamation was also repealed, and at a Pitso held on the 24th of April, 1883, a very liberal constitution was offered to the Basutos. Masupha, however, the chief of the Berea district, with several other chiefs of influence, held aloof, and practically declared their intention to have no further connection with the Colonial Government, and the tribe generally were understood to wish to be under the direct authority of the Imperial Government. In the meantime a strong feeling in favour of the entire abandonment of Basutoland had grown up in the Colony, and on the request of the Colonial Ministry the Imperial Government decided to undertake for a time the administration of the country on condition that satisfactory evidence was given by the Basutos of their desire to remain under the British Crown, that the Orange Free State should undertake to cause the frontier to be respected by its subjects, and that the Colony should pay over towards the cost of administration the Customs duties received on goods imported into Basutoland. This offer was accepted by the Colony, and provision was made in the Basutoland Disannexation Act of 1883 for the payment of £20,000 a year, and the Free State also intimated its willingness to comply with the conditions so far as it was concerned.

A great national Pitso of the Basutos was held on the 29th of November, 1883, attended by the representatives of more than two-thirds of the whole tribe, who unanimously expressed their willingness to comply with the conditions on which the Imperial Government was prepared to assume the responsibility of the administration of the country. Several important chiefs who were not at the Pitso subsequently expressed their concurrence in this resolution, Masupha alone refusing to accept the offers of the Government, and desiring to remain independent. Her Majesty's Government upon this decided that their conditions were sufficiently complied with, advised the Queen to sanction the Disannexation Act, and immediately took steps for carrying on the government under the immediate authority of the Crown, from the 13th March, 1884. Masupha tendered his submission in 1886, and asked for a magistrate to be resident in his district.

**Constitution.**

The territory is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for South Africa, the latter possessing the legislative authority, which is exercised by proclamation.

The chiefs adjudicate on cases between natives, with a right of appeal to the Magistrates' Courts, where all cases between the natives and Europeans are brought.

For fiscal and other purposes the country is divided into 7 districts, namely, Maseru, Leribe, Mohale's Hoek, Berea, Mafeteng, Quthing, and Qacha's Nek. Each of the districts is subdivided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the Moseshi family. The revenue arises from the post office, native tax, the sale of licences, and customs.

Serious crime is rare, and the drinking habits, which threatened to destroy the people, have been to a great extent abandoned owing to the influence of the missionaries, and the Government. There is not a single canteen in the country. The area under arable cultivation steadily increases, and there is less and less tendency to stock-thieving and petty warfare.

**Education.**

Excellent work is being carried on in the country by missionaries, in whose hands the labour of education is almost exclusively vested. There are 286 schools, with 22,099 scholars, a very large proportion being in the schools of the French Protestant Mission. There are four small Government schools, and grants in aid of education to the extent of £16,771 were made for the year 1913-14.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no navigable waterways, the rivers being low in winter and flooded generally in summer. The usual mode of conveyance is by ox-waggon or light cart.

The roads in the country are now in good condition for any kind of transport, but the periodical rains draining down from the high watersheds seriously damage them. Bridges have been constructed across the Hlotse river, the Khomo-khoana river, the Caledon river at Ficksburg and the Little Caledon river near Maseru. A road and railway bridge has been built across the Caledon river at Maseru. New bridges have been made across the Phutiatsana river near Tevatayaneng and the Mekhaleng river near Mohale's Hoek, and over the Tsoaening and Tlametlu streams in Maseru district. There are no railways through the country, but in December, 1905, the Central South African Railways opened a branch line running from Marseilles station on their Bloemfontein-Madderpoort line to a point just within the Basutoland border, and close to Maseru.

The line of postal communication is through the Cape Province and Orange Free State Province. Letters to and from Europe take about 20 days, to Cape Town 3 days. Postal rates are similar to those of the Cape Province. The parcels post and money order systems have been extended to Basutoland. The telegraph stations are Hlotse Heights, Tevatayaneng, Maseru, Morija, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek, Quthing, while a Government telephone line runs throughout the country to all Government stations. Qacha's Nek is now connected with Matatiele in the Cape Province by telephone.

**Trade.**

The imports consist chiefly of blankets, ploughs, saddlery, clothing, iron and tin ware, and groceries.

The exports consist chiefly of grain, cattle, wool, and horses. The commercial intercourse is almost exclusively with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State Province.

Basutoland from the 1st July, 1891, was admitted into a Customs Union with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State, by which arrangement a share of Customs duties collected at the ports of the Cape Province was credited to Basutoland, but retained by the Cape Government on account of the annual contribution of £18,000. Basutoland now receives, by arrangement, a proportion of Customs Revenue collected by the Union Government (see under South Africa, "Customs").
The High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 10 of Aug. 5th, 1903, declared the admission of Basutoland into a South African Customs Union in terms of the Convention entered into in that year between Cape Province, Natal, the O.R.C., Transvaal, Southern Rhodesia, Basutoland, and Bechuanaland Protectorate. A new Convention was signed in 1906, but the position of Basutoland as a member of the Union remained unchanged.

Currency and Banking.

The Standard Bank has opened a branch in Maseru, and there are branches of Post Office Savings Bank at most of the Government Stations. The currency is exclusively British, but exchange, and occasionally the payment of taxes, is still largely conducted by barter.

BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE.

Situation and Area.

The territory of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the South and East by the Union of South Africa, on the North by Southern Rhodesia and the Zambesi and Chobe Rivers, and on the West by German territory. Its area is estimated at about 275,000 square miles, and the population, according to the census taken on the 7th of May, 1911, was 125,350, of whom 1,692 were Europeans or white.

History.

During the year 1885, Sir Charles Warren, who was in command of an expedition despatched from England to pacify Southern Bechuanaland, where for some time previously hostilities had been proceeding between the Bechuanas and Boers from the South African Republic, visited the principal chiefs in Northern Bechuanaland (known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate), Khama, Gasa-tse, and Sebele, and as a result a British Protectorate was proclaimed over their territories. No further steps were taken until the year 1891, when, by an Order in Council dated 9th May, the limits of the Bechuanaland Protectorate were more clearly defined, and the High Commissioner was authorised to appoint such officers as might appear to him to be necessary to provide for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue, and generally for the peace, order, and good government of all persons within the limits of the Order.

Sir Sidney Shippard, the Administrator of Bechuanaland, was appointed Resident Commissioner, and an Assistant Commissioner was appointed for the Northern Protectorate, and another for the Southern Protectorate.

For fiscal and several other purposes the Protectorate was treated as a portion of the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland, until the latter was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 15th November, 1895. In the autumn of that year arrangements were made for the transfer of the administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, with the exception of certain reserves for native chiefs, to the British South African Company, and the Company's police were moved down to a camp in the Protectorate at Pitsani Potlogo. On the 29th of December Dr. Jameson, with his police, crossed the border of the South African Republic and marched towards Johannesburg, which was at the time in a state of great unrest, but being defeated by the Boers at Doornkop, surrendered on the 2nd January, 1896. In consequence of the raid, the administration of the Protectorate was not transferred to the Company. Since the annexation of British Bechuanaland to the Cape the Protectorate has been governed as a separate territory under the name of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and the form of government is very similar to that which obtains in Basutoland. There is a Resident Commissioner, who is under the direction of the High Commissioner, and there are two Assistant Commissioners, one stationed...
at Francistown, in the Northern Protectorate, and the other at Gaberones, in the Southern Protectorate. For the maintenance of law and order there is a force of police known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate Police, numbering 175. This force is under the direct control of the Resident Commissioner. There are 14 officers, 4 warrant officers, 53 European non-commissioned officers and men, and 63 Basuto non-commissioned officers and men. There are also 100 Bechuana employed as messengers. The police are stationed in small detachments at various places in the Protectorate. The headquarters of the Administration is at Mafeking, in the Cape Province.

Climate and Industries.

The climate is delightful during the winter and fairly healthy during seven months of the year. During the summer months malarial fever is generally prevalent.

The Protectorate is essentially a pastoral country, and although mealies and Kaffir corn are reaped by the natives in large quantities when the season is favourable, the rainfall is insufficient, or perhaps too uneven and uncertain in its distribution, to render agriculture anything but a hazardous pursuit. The staple product consists of horned cattle which according to the census in 1912 numbered 323,911. There were at the same time 338,336 sheep and goats. A large quantity of fire-wood is exported by rail from the Southern Protectorate, chiefly to Kimberley, and a considerable quantity of timber suitable for mining props is also sent out of the country. Precautions are taken to see that none other than dead wood is exported for fuel, and that in felling trees for mining purposes only those of a certain size are used and only a certain limited number cut down in each locality. In the North, in the Tati district, gold mining has been carried on, on a small scale, for years. During the year 1913, 4,227 ozs. gold and 512 ozs. silver, valued at 17,767l., were produced.

Native Chiefs.

The principal chiefs are:

Khama, Chief of the Bamangwato, whose chief town is Serowe.
Sechele, Chief of the Bakwena, who lives at Molepolole.
Gaseitsiwe, Chief of the Bangwaketsi, who lives at Kanye.
Linchwe, Chief of the Bakhatla, who lives at Mochudi.
Mathibe, Chief of the Batswana, who lives at Lake Ngami, near which at Tsau there is a Resident Magistrate and a small detachment of police under a sub-inspector.
Baitlotle, Chief of the Bamalete, who lives at Ramoutsu.

Means of Communication.

The main trunk railway to the North, which connects Rhodesia with Cape Town and which has now been extended beyond the Victoria Falls, runs through the Protectorate. The line north of Vryburg in the Cape Province is the property of the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, to whom, under an agreement made in 1894, the Protectorate Government was to pay a subsidy of 20,000l. a year for ten years, which has now lapsed.

Finances.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1905-6 | £28,553 | £74,783 |
| 1906-7 | 29,047 | 77,111 |
| 1907-8 | 31,503 | 75,851 |
| 1908-9 | 42,050 | 75,801 |
| 1909-10 | 49,788 | 65,268 |
| 1910-11 | 52,067 | 64,791 |

| 1912-13 | 62,114 | 62,393 |
| 1913-14 | 65,139 | 66,749 |

The estimated expenditure for the year ending the 31st March, 1915, is 60,165l., and the estimated revenue 69,126l. The revenue is derived principally from Customs and Hut Tax, and the chief item of expenditure is police. Except in the case of importations from German South West Africa, no customs duty is collected in the Protectorate, but under an Agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Customs revenue, calculated on the average receipts for three completed years prior to Union, is received from the Union Treasury.

SWAZILAND.

Situation and Area.

Swaziland is bounded on the North, West, and South by the Transvaal, and on the East by Portuguese territory and Tongaland, now part of the Natal Province.

Its area is approximately 6,553 square miles.

Description and Climate.

The territory is divided geographically into three longitudinal regions.

The mountainous region on the West approximates an altitude of over 4,000 feet.

What is known as the Middle Veld is some 2,000 feet lower, while the Low Veld, bounded on the East by the Lebombo Mountains, attains an average altitude of not more than 1,000 feet. The first two regions are well watered and healthy, but the Low Veld cannot be described as either.

Mbabane, the headquarters of the Administration, is situated on the hills at an altitude of 4,300 feet, and Bremersdorp, the old capital, is on the Middle Veld. There are no other European villages.

History.

Swaziland, known to the natives as "Kwangwane," has been in the occupation of the Swazi tribes for a considerable period, and the present Ama-Swazi are no doubt the descendants of the early Bantu invaders, who occupied the country contemporaneously with the occupation of adjacent territory by allied tribes. The history of the consolidation into a nation of a congeries of tribes dates from early in the eighteenth century, when the adoption of a military organisation led to the dominance of one tribe over the others.

Certain "Medicine" and rain cattle were captured from Sikukuni by the Swazis, who lent assistance in the operations against that chief in the time of the first British occupation of the Transvaal, and the possession of this rain medicine has invested the paramount chief of Swaziland, in the minds of the natives of South Africa, with high authority as a rain maker.

The Swazis, while strong enough to repel a Zulu invasion, were nevertheless subject to the aggression of these neighbours, who, with the Boers, claimed authority over the country. In the Conventions of Pretoria (1881), and London (1884) Her Majesty's Government, however, expressly stipulated for the independence of Swaziland.

During the eighties the King "Mbandini" granted concessions for certain sums and periods. Every conceivable right was granted away, not only for land, minerals, grazing, and timber, but also for all imaginable purposes, including exemption from taxes, railways, telegraphs, mining patents, collection of the King's revenue, trading, etc., etc. All unallotted lands and minerals also formed the subject of concessions.

In 1888 a charter of self-government was granted to the whites in the country. Later, in 1890, under a Convention between Her Majesty's Government and the South African Republic, a provisional Government was, with the consent of the Swazis, set up, consisting of a Government Committee composed of representatives of those two Powers, and a representative of the Swazis, a Government Secretary, and of a Chief Court. This Court adjudicated on the initial validity of all concessions granted by the King, and, with few exceptions, confirmed the grants in respect of such initial validity.

In accordance with pledges given to the Government of the South African Republic the provisional Administration came to an end three years later, when the British Government signed a fresh Convention, which permitted the South African Republic to acquire from the Regent and her Council an Organic Proclamation conferring on the South African Republic rights of jurisdiction, legislation and administration without incorporation in the South African Republic. The Swazis never signed the Organic Proclamation which had been drafted for them, and accordingly its provisions, with some of those in the 1893 Convention, were embodied in the final Convention of 1894, under which the South African Republic exercised powers of protection, legislation, jurisdiction and administration in Swaziland, subject to the limitations of the Convention.

On the conquest of the Transvaal, all the rights and powers of the late South African Republic passed to His Majesty, but since the other party to the Convention of 1894 had disappeared without the limitations therein, an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act was issued in June, 1903, providing that the Governor of the Transvaal should administer Swaziland, and conferring on him the right to legislate by Proclamation.

On the cessation of hostilities a British Special Commissioner, with a small force of South African Constabulary, was sent into the country, and a provisional Administration was established.

In accordance with the powers granted to him, the Governor issued a Proclamation in 1904 providing for administration and for dealing with the concessions question. The Laws of the Transvaal in force at that date of the Proclamation were applied to Swaziland, mutatis mutandis. Courts were established with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the Transvaal, and an appeal was permitted from the decisions of the chiefs in civil matters to the Court of the Resident Magistrate. The chiefs were otherwise confirmed in their civil jurisdiction over natives, subject to the exclusion of usages incompatible with the due exercise of His Majesty's power and jurisdiction, or clearly injurious to the welfare of the natives.

The Commission constituted under the Proclamation of 1904 to deal with the concessions examined the concessions granting exclusive rights, except exclusive rights to land and minerals, with a view to their expropriation at their value prior to the commencement of hostilities. The Commission reported in 1906, and the concessions, the subject of its report, were, with a few exceptions, expropriated. The Commission has now dealt with the question of boundaries of land, mineral and grazing concessions. The general survey of these concessions, necessary to determine the conflicting rights, is now complete. The Proclamation of 1904 further provided for the settlement of the rights of the natives, which in a modified form, is now completed.

By an Order in Council, dated 1st December, 1906, His Majesty's Government transferred the control of Swaziland from the Governor of the Transvaal to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Under the Order in Council the High Commissioner issued a Proclamation in March, 1907, providing for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, a
Government Secretary, Assistant Commissioners and the establishment of a Police Force. The Laws of the Transvaal were re-enacted, mutatis mutandis, and, except where modified by Statute, the Roman-Dutch Common Law was put in force by the Proclamation. A special Court, having the full jurisdiction of a Superior Court, was established together with Courts of Assistant Commissioners with a limited jurisdiction.

The paramount chief and other chiefs were confirmed in their Civil Jurisdiction over natives subject to appeal to the Resident Commissioner. Provision was made for the Swaziland Deeds Office and Surveyor-General's Office to remain at Pretoria under control of the officers responsible prior to the date of the Proclamation.

Population.

The population of Swaziland, according to the census of 1911, was 1,083 whites and 98,876 coloured. Estimated population, March 31st, 1914, 107,117.

The Swazi are a kindred race to the Zulu. They have easily accessible markets for their labour, both locally and in the Transvaal, but their efforts in this direction are spasmodic, though large numbers have gone to work on the W. W. Rand Mines in recent years.

The paramount chief is "Sobhuza," a boy of about fifteen years of age. His grandmother, "Nabotsibeni," widow of "Mbandini," acts as Regent, and has the assistance of a council of chiefs. A few of the principal chiefs are:

- Nogcogco Dhlamini, brother of Mbandini.
- Jokovu Dhlamini.
- Malunge Dhlamini, son of Mbandini.
- Ndabazozwe Dhlamini.
- Silelo Neubande.
- Makambane Fakude.
- Sihlelo Madhuli.
- Ntshingili Simelana.
- Tikuba Dhlamini.

The English Church Mission, The South Africa General Mission, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission, the African Methodist Episcopal Mission the Wesleyan Methodist Mission, the Independent Methodist Mission, and the American International Holiness Union have representatives in the country.

The Administration has a native school at Zombodi, the kraal of the Regent, at which the young paramount chief attends, and has schools for European children at Mbabane, Bremersdorp, Ferreira's, Hluti, Mantambi, and Driefontein.

Industries, Agriculture & Trade.

Mining in Swaziland is carried on under the authority of Concessions granted by the late King Mbandini. Gold is worked at several Mines near the western border. Tin is found in payable quantities in the vicinity of Mbabane. The Crown owns a few mineral areas, some of which it is proposed to throw open to the public for prospecting and mining. The following is the output of tin and gold for the last six years.

The native crops consist of maize, millet, sweet potatoes, ground nuts, etc., grown in insufficient quantities to meet local demands. With the completion of the general survey of Concessions and the definition of rights a decided advance in farming by Europeans has taken place. The Government has disposed to farmers who will give beneficial occupation, numerous small blocks of Crown Land suitable for agricultural farming. Experiments have been conducted in cotton growing with encouraging results. Tobacco is grown in small quantities and has given a good return. The Government Horticulturist of the Transvaal has reported very favourably on the prospects of fruit growing. He was especially impressed with the suitability of the climate and soil for citrus fruits and mangoes.

There are approximately 73,000 head of horned stock, and 170,000 native sheep and goats in the territory. Cattle ranching on a large scale has been commenced by several companies formed for the purpose. Between 150,000 and 200,000 sheep (Merinos) are brought in each year from the high veld for winter grazing, but this class of sheep is not farmed in Swaziland during the summer months.

No statistics of the imports into and the exports from Swaziland are now kept. By an agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Swaziland is dealt with, for Customs purposes, as a part of the Union. Payments due to Swaziland are assessed on the proportions which the average of the collections for the three years ended March 31st, 1910, bear to the total customs collections of the Union in each year. The imports consist principally of maize, flour, groceries, wearing apparel, hardware, spirits and tobacco; while the principal exports are Cassiterite Tin and Raw Gold.

There is a branch of the National Bank of South Africa, Limited, at Mbabane, as also a Post Office Savings Bank. The currency is British.

Stores exist where necessary to serve the needs of the population, but the volume of trade is small.

Revenue and Expenditure.

The revenue and expenditure for the year ended March 31st, 1914, was

| Revenue | £64,249. |

| Expenditure | £63,966. |

The public debt on March 31st, 1914, was 100,000L.

RHODESIA.*

Rhodesia (so called after the late Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes) is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in its Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese Dominions." Of these extensive territories the Company is now responsible for the administration of the following portions:

1. Southern Rhodesia, or the provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland (area 148,575 square miles).

2. Northern Rhodesia, or the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the Nyasaland Protectorate. The area is estimated at about 291,000 square miles.

I.—SOUTHERN RHODESIA.

The limits of Southern Rhodesia, as defined by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 20th October, 1888, are the parts of South Africa bounded by the Portuguese Possessions, by the Transvaal Colony to a point opposite the mouth of the River Shashi, by the River Shashi to its junction with the Tati and Ramaquabun rivers, thence by the Ramaquaban river to its source, thence by the watershed to the Rivers Shashi and Ramaquaban until such watershed strikes the Hunter's Road (called the Pandamatenka Road), thence by that road to the River Zambesi, and by that river to the Portuguese boundary. The said limits include an area of ten miles' radius round Fort Tuli, but exclude the area of the district known as the Tati district as defined by the Charter.

II.—NORTHERN RHODESIA.

This territory was previously divided into two provinces:

(a.) Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.

(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.

By the order in Council, dated 4th May, 1911, these two provinces were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. The amalgamation took effect from 17th August, 1911. The limits of the territory as defined by the order in Council are "the parts of Africa bounded by Southern Rhodesia, German South-West Africa, Portuguese West Africa, the Congo Free State, German East Africa, Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa."

History.

On the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lobengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Macloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was duly reached, and Fort Salisbury, 12 miles South-east of Mount Hampden, having been founded (12th September, 1890) the pioneers were disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims and farms.

In July, 1893, the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives living under the Company's protection, near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland, to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's police and a small force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's forces near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lobengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Shangani, and Major Wilson and a small party of men were, after a heroic resistance killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from small-pox or fever.

In 1896, owing to a variety of causes, the Matabele broke out in rebellion, and shortly after the Mashonas followed suit. After a prolonged struggle the rebellion was subdued in September, 1897.

The rinderpest, which for several years had been devastating Africa, travelling slowly through the continent from north to south, made its first appearance in Matabeleland in February, 1896. The adoption of the drastic regulations which the administration decided to enforce had to some extent checked the progress of the epidemic, when the outbreak of the rebellion put a stop to all precautionary measures.

In March, 1898, a system of compulsory inoculation for rinderpest was established, and the precautions taken completely stamped out the disease.

From 1897 to 1899 the development of the country advanced rapidly, but the outbreak of the war with the Republics, in October, 1899, practically put a stop to progressive work of every kind, and for months the territory was completely cut off from the south.

On the outbreak of hostilities Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir Robert) Baden-Powell was in supreme command of all the forces in Southern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. When Mafeking was invested the command of the Rhodesian forces devolved upon Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir H. C.) Plumer, who was stationed at Tuli with a force of 450 men. In November, 1899, Martial Law was proclaimed in certain districts in Matabeleland, and, at a later date, in the whole territory, and the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers to the number of 800, were called out for active service.

At the beginning of January, 1900, Colonel Plumer moved his column to Palachwe and assumed direct command of the troops in the Protectorate, amongst whom were included 600 Volunteers and over 400 men of the British South Africa Police. Mafeking was successfully relieved by Mahon and Plumer's united columns on the 17th May.

In the early part of 1900 a force of 5,000 men, consisting of Australian, New Zealand and Canadian Volunteers, and English Yeomanry, was despatched to Rhodesia, via Beira, under the command of General Sir Frederick Carrington. This force was sent to the front as speedily as possible, two companies of Militia Infantry being retained at Bulawayo as a garrison.

The Administration of Southern Rhodesia estimated that the number of men contributed by Rhodesia was approximately 1,500, being at least 12½ per cent. of the European population. Despatches which have been published bear testimony to the good work performed by the Volunteers, Police, and the Rhodesia Regiment, and they also gained the special approbation of the late Commander-in-Chief.

The attitude of the natives throughout the war was most satisfactory, and, although in some districts there appeared signs of unrest, it was confined to attempts by discontented natives to work up the feelings of the people, who were, however, not affected by them to any appreciable degree.

Martial Law in Southern Rhodesia was withdrawn on the 26th July, 1902.

Constitution.

In 1888 that portion of Rhodesia now known as Southern Rhodesia was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1899, a resolution was passed agreeing to accept the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government to be made in the original Charter of the Company by a Supplemental Charter, and a further resolution was passed approving certain alterations in the original Deed of Settlement of the Company. These resolutions were confirmed at a further Extraordinary General Meeting, held on the 10th of January, 1900.
The Constitution of Southern Rhodesia, originally laid down by the Charter, was subsequently amended by the Orders in Council of the 9th May, 1891; 30th July, 1891; and 18th July, 1894, the latter being known as the "Matabeleland Order in Council." This Order was revoked by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1898, which provides for the Administration of the Territory, Legislation, the Preservation of Peace and Order, the Constitution of Courts of Justice, and Native Administration. This Order has been amended by the Southern Rhodesia Orders in Council of the 16th February, 1903, 10th August, 1909, and 4th May, 1911. Under the Order of 1898, as amended, there is a Resident Commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State. To assist the Administrator there is an Executive Council, composed of not less than three members appointed by the Company, with the approval of the Secretary of State. A member of the Executive Council holds office for a period of three years, unless sooner removed by the Company, but is eligible for re-appointment at the end of each term of office. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of the Administrator (President), six nominees of the Company approved by the Secretary of State, and twelve members elected by the Registered Voters. The Resident Commissioner sits on both the Executive and Legislative Councils, but without a vote. Ordinances passed by the Legislative Council, when assented to by the High Commissioner, take effect immediately, but within a year may be disallowed by the Secretary of State. The duration of each Legislative Council is three years. The first Legislative Council was elected in 1899. The number of Registered Voters in 1913 was 9,543.

By a Proclamation, dated 10th June, 1891, the laws of the Cape Colony in force on that date were adopted for and are administered in Southern Rhodesia as far as the circumstances of the country will permit, unless amended or repealed by the Legislative Council. The laws of the Cape Colony passed subsequent to the 10th June, 1891, do not apply to Rhodesia.

For the administration of justice there is a High Court with civil and criminal jurisdiction, the judges being appointed by the Secretary of State, on the nomination of the Company. In the districts there are Magistrates' Courts. Appeals from the High Court lie to the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, and thence to the Privy Council.

The administrative system of Northern Rhodesia is prescribed by the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council of 4th May, 1911.

On the 9th October, 1914, His Majesty's Government published the following notice in the press:

"His Majesty's Government have had under their careful consideration the question of the future administration of the territories at present administered by the British South Africa Company. Clause 33 of the Company's Charter, which bears date the 29th day of October, 1889, reserves to the Crown the power at the end of twenty-five years from the date of the Charter, and at the end of every succeeding period of ten years, to add to or repeal any of the provisions of the Charter or to enact other provisions in substitution for or in addition to any of its existing provisions. It is further provided that this power shall only be exercised in relation to so much of the Charter as relates to administrative and public matters, and failing the exercise of this power the Charter is automatically extended for another ten years.

His Majesty's Government are advised that there is no power, either in the Charter or elsewhere, to shorten or vary the periods at the end of which addition to, or alteration or repeal of, the administrative provisions of the Charter is possible.

The Directors of the British South Africa Company have, however, informed Mr. Harcourt that they would not regard the non-exercise by His Majesty of his right of reviewing on the 29th instant such of the provisions of the Charter as relate to administrative and public matters as any bar to the establishment of Responsible Government, should the time appear to be ripe for such a step during the ten years which would elapse before, under the terms of the Charter, His Majesty's right of review would again become exercisable; and that if, during those ten years, the inhabitants of Southern Rhodesia should find that they were, financially and in other respects, strong enough to assume, with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government, the burden of administration, and should express through the Legislative Council their desire to assume that burden, they, the Directors, would be most willing that effect should be given to that desire.

In view of this statement and of the desire expressed by the Legislative Council for the continuance of the Company's administration, His Majesty's Government have decided not to advise His Majesty to exercise the powers reserved by Article 33 of the Charter, and its administrative and public provisions will accordingly not be modified. His Majesty will, however, be advised, in due course, to issue a Supplemental Charter, giving effect to the arrangement, to which the Directors of the British South Africa Company have agreed, to render possible the establishment of Responsible Government in Southern Rhodesia, should the Legislative Council desire it, and should His Majesty's Government concur, at some date other than that which the Charter permits."

Local Government.

Salisbury and Bulawayo were constituted municipalities in October, 1897, and Gwelo and Umtali in August, 1914. Sanitary Boards are appointed for the other principal towns.

Native Administration.

The Native Department of Southern Rhodesia is administered by the Secretary for Native Affairs, the duties of the office at the present time being undertaken by the Administrator. He is assisted by a Chief Native Commissioner, whose duties are defined by High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 32 of 1913. The Territory is divided into 32 native districts, each in charge of a Native Commissioner, who is appointed by the Administrator, with the approval of the High Commissioner, as laid down in the "Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," and whose duties are defined by the High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 55 of 1910 (promulgated 14th October, 1910).

Formerly the natives were scattered throughout the country, but now land has been reserved for tribal settlements which is suitable for their agricultural and pastoral requirements. A special Commission was appointed by the Imperial
Authorities in 1914 for the purpose of finally defining these Native reservations.

The only tax imposed upon them is an annual poll-tax of 1/. Excellent provision has been made for those who go to work at the mines. Compounds have been erected and hospitals provided at most of the mines, which are periodically visited by Government Inspectors; their contracts are supervised by officials who see that the terms are faithfully fulfilled by the employers, and in the event of injustice they have their remedy in a court of law under the "Master's and Servant's Ordinance." A native at the mines can easily earn from 30s. to 3l. a month with food and lodging.

Climate.

The Rhodesian plateau lies at an altitude of from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. Broadly speaking, the year has two divisions, the wet and the dry season. The early rains of the wet season (which is the summer) gradually appear towards the end of October, increase in frequency and force until January, and disappear about the end of April. From May to September there is practically no rain. Taking into consideration the vast extent of the territory the climate naturally varies. In the highlands it is very healthy and bracing. Formerly, in the low-lying districts, malarial fever was very prevalent, but with the opening up of the country, better housing and food, it is rapidly disappearing. The summer is not oppressively hot, nor is the winter very cold. The average shown by the maximum and minimum thermometers in the shade at the principal towns, during the year ending 30th June, 1912, was:

| Town       | Max. | Min. |
|------------|------|------|
| Salisbury  | 77.5 | 52.0 |
| Bulawayo   | 79.3 | 54.4 |

Rainfall.

| Town       | Inches |
|------------|--------|
| Salisbury  | 21.16  |
| Umtali     | 14.28  |
| Bulawayo   | 19.95  |

There are hospitals at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, Victoria, Hartley, Mazoe, Gwanda, Enkeldoorn, Gatooma, Abercorn, Sinoia and Gwelo, each supplied with a complete staff of doctors and nurses. Cottage hospitals have also been erected in various districts to meet the wants of the mining centres.

Population.

A census for Southern Rhodesia was taken on the 7th May, 1911, showing the number of Europeans to be 23,606 (Mashonaland, 12,631; Matabeleland, 10,975). Since that date it is estimated that the number of Europeans has increased by between 6,000 and 7,000, bringing the white population up to 30,000 approximately. The native population was 744,559 (Mashonaland, 495,451; Matabeleland, 249,108). There were also 2,912 Asiatics and other coloured persons. The European population of Northern Rhodesia on the same date was 1,497, and the native population is estimated at 824,756. It is estimated that the European population has increased, approximately, to 2,500, since the date of the census.

Chief Towns.

The chief towns of Southern Rhodesia are Salisbury (the capital), Hartley, Gatooma, Umtali and Victoria in Mashonaland; and Bulawayo, Gwelo and Selukwe, in Matabeleland. Townships have also been formed at Rusapi, Gwanda, Enkeldoorn, Melsetter, Umvuma and at other places.

Salisbury, the seat of the Government, has a white population of 3,479. The town stands 4,880 feet above sea level. Branches of the Standard Bank, National Bank of South Africa, and African Banking Corporation have been established.

Bulawayo is the commercial centre of Matabeleland, with a white population of 5,200 and stands 4,469 feet above the sea level. Branches of the same banks as at Salisbury have been opened. There is a public hospital which is one of the finest in South Africa. The town is on the main line of railway from Cape Town to the far north, and is distant from Cape Town 1,362 miles.

Railways.

The Bechuanaland Railways (now Rhodesia Railways, Limited) reached Bulawayo on the 19th October, 1897, and the line to that town was formally opened on the 4th November. An extension of the Beira Railway from Umtali reached Salisbury on the 1st May, 1899, and was opened on the 22nd May. On the 1st August, 1900, the widening of the gauge of the Beira Railway to 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa, was completed. On the 6th October, 1902, the line was completed between Salisbury and Bulawayo, a distance of 301 miles, thus establishing through communication between Cape Town and Beira (over 2,000 miles). The line passes through the mining districts of Hartley, Queque, Gwelo, Bembezi, etc. The railway from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls (282 miles) on the River Zambesi was completed in June, 1904, and the further extension northward, via Kalomo, to the Broken Hill Mine, 374 miles from the Falls, was opened for traffic on 1st September, 1906. Another section of the line from Broken Hill to the Congo Border (132 miles) was completed in December, 1909, by the Rhodesia-Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company, Limited. There is, therefore, through communication between Cape Town and the northern border of Northern Rhodesia, a total distance of 2,149 miles. A further extension to Kambove, in the Congo State (272 miles), has been constructed by the Compagnie du Chemin de fer du Katanga. The Zambesi river is crossed by a bridge 650 feet long, 30 feet wide, and about 420 feet above the level of the water. The structure was formally opened by the late Sir G. H. Darwin, K.C.B., President of the British Association, on the 12th September, 1905. A line from Bulawayo to the West Nicholson mine in the Gwanda district (120 miles), to open up the gold and coal areas to the south-east, has been constructed, and a line, with a 2-feet gauge, from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine in the Lomagundi district (84 miles), was opened for traffic on the 1st November, 1902. A branch (12 miles) has been made from this line to the Eldorado Mine. These two branches have since been widened to standard gauge (3 ft. 6 in.). The line has since been extended beyond the Eldorado Mine across the Hunyani River into the Sinoia district (4 miles). A line from Gwelo to Selukwe (24 miles) was completed in August, 1903, and one from Lyndhurst Halt (near Gwelo) to Umvuma (50 miles), was opened in June, 1909. An extension of this
line to Victoria, a further 70 miles, was opened on the 10th July, 1914. A railway from Salisbury to the Jumbo Mine in the Maze district (about 22 miles) was recently opened for traffic and an extension of this line to Shavva in the Salisbury district, a distance of about 50 miles from the Jumbo Mine, was opened on 23rd April last. A line to the Matopos, where Mr. Rhodes is buried, was opened for traffic on November 1st, 1903.

The total mileage of the Rhodesian Railway Systems (including the Beira Railway) at the end of 1914 was 2,168 miles.

Lands and Agriculture.

In 1897 a geodetic survey of Southern Rhodesia was initiated under the superintendence of the late Sir David Gill, K.C.B., H.M. Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, and was completed to the Zambesi river, in August, 1901.

Unimproved land in Southern Rhodesia may be purchased from the British South Africa Company outright for cash, subject to the fulfilment of a simple occupation condition, or it may be held under a permit of occupation with option of purchase for cash, or by instalments, at any time within ten years. The title deed gives the purchaser the freehold to the land subject to an annual payment of quit-rent, which is roughly £1 per 1,000 acres. An extensive scheme for the promotion of closer settlement by Europeans is now under consideration by the British South Africa Company. Applications for land should be addressed to the Director of Land Settlement, Salisbury, Rhodesia. Information and handbooks can be supplied by the Rhodesian Emigration and Information Office, 138, Strand, London, W.C., or the Emigration and Information Office, 140, Buchanan Street, Glasgow.

Special steamship and railway facilities are given to bond fide farmer settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for the benefit of the farming community.

Considerable tracts of land have been placed under cultivation, and fresh stock is being imported. It may be said that virtually the whole of Southern Rhodesia is well watered, and adapted for stock-raising and for agriculture. Cattle generally do very well in all parts. Sheep and goats thrive in many parts and will do better after the grass is fed down. Pigs thrive well, and, so far, have never shown disease. Poultry and eggs always command a ready sale at remunerative prices. Throughout the country the conditions of soil and climate are suitable for all kinds of European cereals and vegetables, and, in addition, many trees, shrubs and plants peculiar to sub-tropical regions can be successfully cultivated. Maize, Kaffir-corn, and other native cereals grow well in the rainy season without irrigation. Tobacco culture has now passed the experimental stage, and the industry is being rapidly developed. The plant grows luxuriantly, and a considerable acreage is under cultivation. Maize and tobacco are already being exported, and later it is hoped to export other products such as fibres, rubber and cotton. Large fruit orchards have been planted, and nearly all fruit trees thrive, the cultivation of oranges and lemons constituting a rapidly expanding industry. The sale of dairy produce is a profitable industry in the neighbourhood of the towns.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails from the United Kingdom to Southern Rhodesia are conveyed by the mail steamers of the subsidised Union-Castle Company, weekly, between Southampton and Table Bay. From Cape Town they are conveyed by train to Bulawayo in 2½ days. There are also daily mail and passenger trains from Cape Town to Bulawayo performing the journey in four days. From Bulawayo to Salisbury the mails are conveyed five times a week, the journey occupying about 20 hours. There are three mail and passenger trains weekly between Salisbury and Beira, the time occupied on the journey being 27½ hours.

A few of the outlying districts of Southern Rhodesia are still served by mail coaches and carts.

Northern Rhodesia receives its mails via Bulawayo. They are conveyed from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls and Broken Hill by train, and to the several postal stations in the territory by native runners.

Mail matter may, however, still be forwarded to Fort Jameson and other stations in the Eastern portion of the territory by the Chinde and Blantyre route. The time occupied in the transmission of the mails between Fort Jameson and the United Kingdom is now five weeks and two days.

On the 31st of December, 1913, 98 post offices were open in Southern Rhodesia, at 48 of which Money Order and Savings Bank business was transacted. Telegraph Money Orders are also exchanged between Money Order Offices in Rhodesia and with the United Kingdom, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony.

The rate for inland letters is 1d. per ½ oz., and the same rate to other parts of South Africa. The rate for letters for places over-sea was reduced from 2½d. to 1d. per ½ oz. from 1st April, 1911. The rate for letters from the United Kingdom to Rhodesia is 1d. per oz.

The Rhodesian Telegraph and Telephone system extends from Ramathlama, on the northern border of Cape Colony, to Ujiji in German East Africa, and comprises 8,350 miles of wire, on 3,393 miles of poles.

On the 31st December, 1912, 103 telegraph offices were open. The rate for Inland telegrams is 1d. per word; for telegrams exchanged between Rhodesia and other parts of South Africa, 2d. per word; and for cablegrams to Europe is 2s. 8d. per word. Telegrams from Europe and from South Africa, for the Portuguese province of Manica and Sofala, Portuguese East Africa (including Chinde and Quilimane), the Nyasaland Protectorate, North Eastern Rhodesia, and for German East Africa, all pass over the Rhodesian lines.

Telephone exchanges are in operation at 23 towns and mining centres.

Post Office Savings Banks were established on 1st January, 1905. Up to 31st December, 1913, the amount deposited was 722,010l., and the amount withdrawn was 588,034l. 135,148l. has been invested in Trustee Securities.

Customs.

Prior to the 1st August, 1899, no duties were leviable upon goods entering Southern Rhodesia. On that date the Customs Ordinance came into operation, and continued in force till August, 1903, when, as a result of the South African Customs
Conference, the necessary Ordinance empowering Southern Rhodesia to enter the newly formed Customs Union was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council. This Convention of 1903 was superseded by that of 1906. The Tariff was amended in 1908. On the 30th June, 1910, the Customs Union was terminated by mutual consent, but an agreement has been entered into between Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa, by which the tariff remains unaltered. The following is the value of the declared imports into Southern Rhodesia during the past ten years, together with the amount of duty collected:

| Year ended 31st March | Value (£) | Duty (£) |
|----------------------|-----------|---------|
| 1904                 | 576,619   | 128,387 |
| 1905                 | 951,698   | 105,934 |
| 1906                 | 1,213,776 | 128,250 |
| 1907                 | 1,340,687 | 162,739 |

| 1913                 | 3,018,204 | 269,880 |

Exports from Southern Rhodesia during the past five years:

| Year ended 31st December | Value (£) |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| 1908                     | 2,718,476 |
| 1909                     | 3,159,569 |
| 1910                     | 3,018,099 |
| 1911                     | 3,098,400 |
| 1912                     | 3,181,986 |
| 1913                     | 3,565,157 |

An Ordinance was promulgated on 1st October, 1901, imposing a duty of 6s. per gallon on spirits manufactured in South Africa, and imported into the Territory. Another Ordinance was also promulgated upon the same date imposing an excise duty of a similar amount upon spirits manufactured within Southern Rhodesia.

Minerals.

Gold.—That gold was obtained from Rhodesia in prehistoric times is evidenced from the innumerable "ancient workings," the ruins of temples and forts supposed to date from the time of the Himyarites and Phoenicians, and the discovery of gold beads, gold plates, fine chains, wire, nails, etc. From the occupation of the country in 1890 by the British South Africa Company when the European population amounted to about 500 persons, consisting of the pioneers and a few officials, up to September, 1898, the gold produced only amounted to 6,470 ounces. Since that date, however, the output has been steadily increasing, and the following table shows the progress made during the last ten years:

| Year | Bullion (ozs.) | Estimated Value (£) |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1905 | 407,048        | £1,449,985          |
| 1906 | 551,804        | 1,985,099           |
| 1907 | 612,052        | 2,178,886           |
| 1908 | 606,961        | 2,526,007           |
| 1909 | 623,389        | 2,623,709           |
| 1910 | 609,956        | 2,568,198           |
| 1911 | 628,321        | 2,647,896           |
| 1912 | 642,808        | 2,707,369           |
| 1913 | 689,954        | 2,903,267           |
| 1914 | 854,480        | 3,580,208           |

From the 1st April, 1908, all results have been declared in ounces of fine gold instead of in bullion.

Coal.—For some years past coal has been known to exist in several districts. In the Wankie District, 212 miles from Bulawayo, and 70 miles from the Victoria Falls on the River Zambesi, a coal bed of large extent is being worked. The result of careful and systematic examination shows that as regards quality the coal is only from 4 to 6 per cent. inferior to Welsh steam coal of similar quality. During the 12 months ended 31st December, 1914, the output amounted to 349,459 tons, as against 243,328 tons in 1913. Other promising discoveries of coal have been made in the Victoria, Tuli and Schwungwe districts, also in North-Western Rhodesia, but, so far, sufficient exploratory work has not been carried out to admit of a final opinion being pronounced as to their precise value.

The output of silver during the 12 months ended 31st December, 1914, was 150,792 oz., and for 1913 142,390 oz.

Copper.—Discoveries of copper have been reported in the Victoria, Lomagundi and Gwelo districts in Southern Rhodesia, and highly promising deposits have been disclosed in Northern Rhodesia. During the year 1914, 1,011 tons of copper have been produced in Southern Rhodesia. Tin has also been discovered in the Victoria and Salisbury districts in Southern Rhodesia.

During 1905 diamonds were discovered in the Gwelo district, and 10,582 carats have been declared up to the 31st December, 1914.

Amongst other minerals, 79 tons of wolframite ore, and 327,858 tons of chrome iron ore, have been exported up to 31st December, 1914.

The total output of minerals other than gold up to the 30th November, 1914, was valued at 1,970,372l.

Education.

On the 31st December, 1913, there were in Southern Rhodesia 52 Government and 5 aided schools. During the year 8 new schools were opened. The total number of children in Government-aided schools was 2,729 as against 2,530 for the previous year, an increase of nearly 8 per cent. The total expenditure from Government funds amounted to 56,372l., and 13,760l. was received in respect of tuition fees. The number of native schools which received Government grants during 1913 was 193 as compared with 168 for 1912.

In 1910 two High Schools (one for boys and one for girls) were opened both in Salisbury and Bulawayo, which provide an education fully equal to the best secondary schools in England. The number of pupils enrolled has far exceeded expectations.

Owing to the munificent bequests of the late Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Beit, largely increased educational facilities are now afforded. Scholarships and Bursaries are granted to pupils in the country, and, in addition, there are nine "Rhodes Scholarships" (three per annum) by which a Rhodesian can secure a three years' course at Oxford University.

Sir William H. Milton, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., after a term of office extending over sixteen years, resigned the position of Administrator of Southern Rhodesia in October, 1914, and was succeeded by Mr. Drummond Chaplin.
