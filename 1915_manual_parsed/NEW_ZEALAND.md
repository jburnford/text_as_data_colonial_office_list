NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

By a Proclamation of His Majesty the King, published in the London Gazette, the Colony of New Zealand is to be styled "the Dominion of New Zealand" on and from the 26th September, 1907.

The Dominion of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the South, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Dominion: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 536 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43°45' S. lat., 176°177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length, 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island and adjacent islets is 44,130 square miles, of the South Island 58,120 square miles, of Stewart Island, 662 square miles, of Chatham Islands 372 square miles, and other islands, including the Cook Islands, 577 square miles, a total area of 103,861 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 & 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. long., and 33° and 53° S. lat., are annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, were annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macaulay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands was administered through the Governor of New Zealand until 1900; in October of that year the group was annexed to Her Majesty's Dominions, and resolutions were passed by the New Zealand Parliament for the extension of the boundary of the Dominion to include the group as well as Savage Island and other small islands. By proclamation finally fixing the date from which the boundaries of New Zealand are deemed to be extended, from the 11th June, 1901, the following islands are included:—Rarotonga, Mangaia, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mitiaro, Mauke, Hervey (Manuae), Palmerston (Avanu), Savage (Nine), Pukapuka (Danger), Rakaanga, Manahiki, Penrhyn (Tongareva), and Suwarrow. An account of the Cook Islands is given below.

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the average death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (56°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (51°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington is 50°, from 82° in summer to 32° in winter. The rainfall varies from a mean for the year of 25 inches on the east coast, to 112 inches on the west coast of the South Island, and from 37 inches on the east coast, to 59 inches on the west coast of the North Island.
The average birth rate for the 10 years 1904—1913 was 26·80 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 9·53. The birth rate in 1913 was 26·14 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 9·47.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840 the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1911, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 49,844, all of whom dwelt in the North Island, with the exception of some 2,700 scattered over the other islands.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1850.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 & 16 Vict., cap. 72. By that Act New Zealand was divided into six provinces, subsequently increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vict., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished, provision was made for the division of the Dominion into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, consisting of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Dominion for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments are tenable for seven years only. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every male elector is qualified to become a member. The House of Representatives now consists of 80, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to October.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 200l. a year, payable monthly. Members of the House of Representatives receive 25l. a month, amounting to 300l. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races) the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Dominion and three months in one electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act, 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a property or residential one. Women can vote as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the New Zealand Government. In 1865 the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Dominion is divided into 117 municipalities and 125 counties; the latter being subdivided into 130 road districts and 57 town districts, besides River, Drainage and Water Supply Boards. For the year ended 31st March, 1913, the total receipts of the above local authorities amounted to 5,081,027l., and their expenditure to 4,921,113l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to 11,029,910l. For the year ended 31st December, 1912, the receipts, expenditure and debt of Harbour Boards amounted to 1,246,868l., 1,242,506l., and 6,431,827l. respectively, and of the Christchurch Drainage Board to 44,397l., 38,332l., and 359,500l. respectively. The Dunedin Drainage and Sewerage Board receipts, 70,177l.; expenditure, 74,782l.; debt, 475,000l. The Christchurch Tramway Board receipts, 134,282l.; expenditure, 106,759l.; debt, 551,200l. for year ending 31st March, 1913. Auckland and Suburban Drainage Board receipts, 125,064l.; expenditure, 137,350l.; debt, 305,500l.

Education.

A Government system of primary education was established in 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local
control is in the hands of Education Boards, and of School Committees with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of primary schools (called "public schools") 2,362; scholars on roll, 176,815, including 8,923 Maoris or children of mixed race. The schools are free and unsectarian, and education is compulsory. Specially for native (Maori) education there are 107 village schools maintained by the Government and under the control of the Minister, and ten denominational boarding schools. Scholars on roll of village schools, 4,647 (including 515 Europeans); on roll of boarding schools, 410, of whom 108 are maintained by the Government. Net cost of native school education, £44,723. In the outlying Chatham Islands four schools are maintained by the Government. A school journal providing suitable reading matter is provided by the Department and issued free to all children in Government schools. A comprehensive system of physical education, based on the syllabus of the Board of Education (London) has been introduced into the schools, and a scheme of medical inspection has also been inaugurated. Four training colleges make provision for the training of 400 teachers annually. Each contains a kindergarten class and a class for secondary education. There is also provision for training classes at smaller centres. Cost of training teachers, £46,029. The total expenditure by the Government under the head of primary education was for 1913-14, £1,095,000. There is a system of superannuation for teachers giving an annuity of one-sixtieth of the average of the final three years' salary for each year of service.

Maintained or subsidized by the Government are special schools for the blind, the deaf, and the feeble-minded. Blind: Government subsidy, £767. for 29 pupils; deaf: 103 pupils, cost £4,756.; feeble-minded: 73 pupils, cost £3,886. The education of blind, deaf, feeble-minded and epileptic children is compulsory from six to twenty-one years of age, subject to exemption by the Minister. The feeble-minded can be kept permanently under restraint, each case being judicially reviewed at intervals of not more than four years.

Ample provision is made for secondary education, both of the ordinary type and that of a technical or vocational character. Wherever the attendance is sufficient, and no other means of secondary education exists the ordinary public school is constituted a district high school, which enables it to hold classes for secondary subjects under special teachers. There are 33 bodies endowed with land or funds arising from public sources for the purpose of carrying on secondary education. Number of pupils at the schools governed by these bodies, 6,151, of whom 4,592 occupied free places under Government regulations. In scholarships and free places at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical schools and classes over 8,200 pupils received free secondary education. Provision is made for manual instruction in both primary and secondary schools, and for instruction in various branches of technology, science and art in connection with technical school and art school classes. During 1913 manual instruction was given in 1,599 primary and secondary schools, and 1,626 technical and art classes were held at 132 centres. There are about 50 more or less fully equipped technical and art schools. During 1913 the Government expenditure on manual and technical education was £109,366.

For higher education there are four endowed colleges affiliated to the University of New Zealand, and each specializes in one or more directions. At Dunedin the special subjects are mining, medicine, dental and veterinary science, and domestic science; at Christchurch, engineering and technical science; at Wellington, law and science; at Auckland, commerce and mining. There is an agricultural college possessing a large endowment and an experimental farm of a very complete character.

The university of New Zealand examines and confers degrees and gives scholarships. It has a statutory endowment of £3,000 a year. Research and other scholarships tenable at the university colleges are given by Government to the value of about £4,148 a year.

The care of neglected and delinquent children is managed by the Education Department, which adopts the boarding-out system, combined with various residential institutions serving for the classification of those that have to be kept under discipline. Of the 2,908 children belonging to the twelve authorised institutions 916 were in residence and 996 boarded out with foster parents. The rest were at service, with friends, etc., under licence. On the grounds of moral degeneracy or unfitness in the public interest to be free from oversight detention beyond the age of 21 may be extended by a magistrate from time to time, thus securing life-long control where necessary. Expenditure for 1913-14, £45,327.

The infant life protection system which provides for the supervision of infants under six years who are maintained apart from their parents for monetary consideration is also administered by the Education Department. There are 1,330 infants under supervision. The death rate is under 1 per cent.

The statistics given above relate mainly to the year 1913. The total cost to the Government for the financial year 1913-14 under the head of education was £1,484,000.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 2nd April, 1911, was found by the census to be 1,008,468 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 49,844, and Cook and other Pacific Islands (12,598). The estimated population of New Zealand (excluding Maoris and residents of Cork and other Pacific Islands), on 30th June, 1914, was 1,091,159.

The population of the chief towns on the 28th March, 1886; 5th April, 1891; 12th April, 1896; 31st March, 1901; 29th April, 1906; and 2nd April, 1911, was as follows:

Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Dominion up to 31st December, 1913, was valued at 82,958,543l.; and the annual production is about two millions sterling. The wool exported in 1913 amounted to 186,533,036 lbs., valued at 8,057,620l. In 1855 it amounted to 1,772,344 lbs., valued at 93,104l. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at 19,339l., had developed an export for 1898 of 656,822 cwt., valued at 783,374l., in 1893 to 903,836 cwt., valued at 1,085,167l., and in 1898, 1,551,773 cwt., valued at 1,698,750l., in 1903, 2,378,650 cwt., valued at 3,197,043l., in 1908, 2,120,303 cwt., valued at 3,188,515l., in 1910, 2,654,196 cwt., valued at 3,850,777l., in 1911, 2,250,565 cwt., valued at 3,503,406l., in 1912, 2,573,238 cwt., valued at 3,909,569l., in 1913, 2,578,693 cwt., valued at 4,449,938l. The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1911, were: horses, 404,284, against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 2,020,171, against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 24,191,810,* against 11,704,853 in 1874. The number of acres under crops in October, 1913, was 1,396,233, exclusive of 14,214,741 acres in sown grasses, 166,774 acres were in wheat, having an estimated yield of 5,231,700 bushels; 361,741 acres were in oats, estimated yield 14,740,946 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton, Napier, Nelson, Wellington and Timaru are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1913, 616 vessels registered, of 159,310 (net) tons in the aggregate.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware and machinery, sugar, tea, alcohol, books, and stationery; and they are obtained almost entirely from England, Australia, the United States, Germany, Belgium, Canada, Ceylon, Japan and China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches in the Dominion:—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, Bank of Australasia, and Commercial Bank of Australia (Limited). The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand on 31st Dec., 1913, was 24,925,284l., and of their note circulation 1,671,075l. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Dominion, having now 747 branches; the amount deposited therein on 31st December, 1913, was 17,131,414l. The private savings banks number five, and the total amount to credit of depositors at March 31st, 1914, was 1,792,108l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Government Insurance Department.

Life Branch.

This department was constituted on the initiative of the late Sir J. Vogel, by legislative enactments passed in 1889 and 1870, and commenced to transact business in March of the latter year. Its constitution was subsequently modified by Acts passed in 1874, 1884, 1886, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1893, 1894 and 1895, now consolidated by the Act of 1908, and amended in 1912. By the Act of 1886 an official board to control and manage the investment of a portion of the department's funds in mortgages on land was constituted. This board consists of the Minister of Finance, the Solicitor-General, the Surveyor-General, the Superintendent N.Z. State Guaranteed Advances Office, the Public Trustee, and the Government Insurance Commissioner. The Act of 1894 empowers loans on mortgage not exceeding 10,000l. to any one person or company. All policies are guaranteed by the State.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the premium rates are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first-class lives to the amount of 5,000l., and in the case of the Accident Branch to the amount of 1,000l. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves.

Accident Branch.

The Accident Branch of the Government Insurance Department was opened in 1901, a separate branch of the department having been constituted, by an Act passed in 1899, for the purpose of transacting Personal Accident Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance. General accident business is undertaken, but the branch was opened more especially with a view to relieve employers of labour of the liability imposed upon them by "The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900." This Act greatly extended the liability of employers, and gave to a workman the right of compensation for all injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, not attributable to his own serious and wilful misconduct.

This liability has been more or less extended by subsequent Acts, and under "The Workers' Compensation Act, 1908," which came into operation on the 1st January, 1909, and its amendments, the scale of compensation is as follows:

(a.) Where death results from the injury and the workman leaves dependants wholly dependent upon his earnings, the compensation is one hundred and fifty-six times his average weekly earnings, but not to be less than 200l., nor to exceed 500l.

(b.) If the dependants are only partially dependent upon the workman's earnings, the compensation is to be such sum as is reasonable and proportionate to the injury to such dependants, but not exceeding the amount payable under paragraph (a).

(c) In either of the above cases the employer is also liable for medical and burial expenses not exceeding 20l., and an amount not exceeding this sum can be claimed where there are no dependants.

(d) Where a workman is totally incapacitated for work, he is entitled to a weekly payment of one-half his average weekly earnings, but the weekly compensation is not to be less than 1l. in cases where the worker's earnings at the time of the accident are not less than 30s. per week. Persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour, whose earnings exceed 5l. per week, are excluded from the benefits of the Act and the maximum weekly payment is limited to 2l. 10s.

* April, 1913.
(c) Where the workman is partially incapacitated only, the compensation is one-half the loss of wages.

(f) In addition to the compensation for incapacity medical or surgical expenses are allowed, not exceeding £1.

The compensation is payable from the date of the accident where the incapacity lasts for fourteen days or more, but if the duration of the incapacity is less than fourteen days, no payment is made for the first week.

Weekly payments are not to extend over a longer period than six years, and the aggregate amount is not to exceed £500.

Special provision is made in the case of wharf labourers, and also for increased compensation to persons under the age of twenty-one, who are permanently incapacitated.

Certain diseases due to the nature of the trade, such as anthrax, lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, etc., are regarded as accidents.

If the accident occurs in the course of employment in or about a mine, building, factory, or ship, the compensation becomes a charge on the employer's interest in the property. In nearly all cases this charge takes precedence of all existing or subsequent charges or encumbrances howsoever created.

The Department's policies cover the full liability of an employer to his workmen under the Workers' Compensation Act, and the liability under common law to the extent of £600 per man.

The premiums are assessed on the wages, and vary from 4s. and 5s. 6d. per 100l. of wages for the lightest occupations to 20s. per cent. for building trades, 56s. per cent. for coal mines to cover accidents only, and 105s. 6d. per cent. for bush felling.

Policies protecting mortgages from loss through the charge of an injured workman taking precedence of a mortgage are issued at premiums varying from 1s. per cent. of the mortgage for small mortgages to 6d. per cent. for large mortgages.

Personal accident policies are also issued securing amounts for accidental death and permanent total or partial disablement, and weekly allowances during temporary disablement.

The premium income and claims of the Accident Branch since the commencement of business have been as follows:

| Year                      | Premium Income | Claims |
|---------------------------|---------------|--------|
| 7th June to 31st December, 1901 | 11,856        | 2,428  |
| Year ending 31st December, 1902 | 14,100        | 7,364  |

| "                           | 1913          | 23,677 |

The funds, assets, and liabilities of the Government Insurance Department belonging to its Accident Branch are kept separate and distinct from those of the Life Branch, and powers are vested in the Governor to make regulations fixing rates of premium and other details for the conduct of the Accident Insurance Branch.

State Fire Insurance.

In the year 1903 was passed an Act "to establish a State Fire Insurance Office and to make other provisions for the insurance and protection of insurable property in New Zealand against loss or damage by fire."

The statute provided for the establishment of an office to be administered by a General Manager appointed by the Governor, and for the necessary staff—not subject to the laws regulating the Civil Service.

Provision is made for the constitution of a Board, to consist of the General Manager, the Minister of Finance, the Government Insurance Commissioner, and two other persons (not being in the Civil Service) appointed by the Governor. The latter hold office for two years, with eligibility for re-appointment, and are remunerated according to appropriation by Parliament.

The Department opened for business with branches and agencies throughout the Dominion in January, 1905. The opening of the office resulted in a reduction in the rates then current of 33½ per cent. on dwellings and the less hazardous risks, and of 10 per cent. on all others. The profit made to the end of December, 1913, was £41,904, and the net income and net losses for each of the nine years to that date have been as follows:

| Year | Net Income | Net Losses |
|------|------------|------------|
|      | £          | £          |
| 1905 | 13,135     | 2,417      |
| 1906 | 20,991     | 10,312     |
| 1907 | 23,302     | 12,701     |
| 1908 | 26,908     | 18,903     |
| 1909 | 34,038     | 18,534     |

Public Works.

All the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony. In the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement, but in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made, and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under road boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1914, there were 2,863 miles of Government and 26 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand, and 223 miles of Government under construction. The construction of new lines and the extension of existing ones is still steadily proceeding.

The expenditure on the 2,863 miles of Government railways has been £32,355,877, or an average of £11,309 per mile. This includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.
The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1913-1914 was £4,043,328, and the working expenses £2,880,323. The balance of £1,163,005 is equal to a return of 3½ per cent. on the capital invested. The gauge throughout is 3 ft. 6 in.

Of telegraphs there are now 13,044 miles of land lines and 44,642 miles of wire, constructed at a cost of over two and a half million pounds. There are five submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand, two, Wakapuaka-La Perouse, connecting the Dominion with Australia.

The Pacific cable, which was opened for traffic to Australia and Fiji in April, 1902, was completed to Bamfield, Vancouver Island, on the 31st October following, and opened for international traffic on the 8th December.

The Pacific cable traffic is transmitted across the Atlantic by the Anglo-American and Commercial Telegraph companies. Following the opening of the Pacific cable a much faster cable service between the Dominion and America and Europe has resulted, and the time has also improved on the Eastern Extension Company's lines. Messages via the Pacific from London frequently reach the Dominion within thirty minutes, and the average time of transmission may be put down at about ninety minutes, which should be regarded as a really good service.

The Pacific traffic is steadily growing, and since the completion of the cable the Dominion's telegraph business by both routes has increased by about 50 per cent.

On the opening of the Pacific cable for through traffic the ordinary rate to Great Britain was reduced from 3s. 4d. to 3s. a word, a previous reduction from 5s. 2d. to 3s. 4d., having been made by the Eastern Company as from the 1st June, 1902; Government messages from 2s. 4d. to 1s. 6½d., and Press from 1s. 2d. to 1s. a word. The charge for press message has since been reduced to 7½d. per word and a deferred rate for press instituted at 4½d. per word. The following reduced rates were also brought into operation: to Vancouver and San Francisco, 2s. 4d. per word; to New York, 2s. 8d. per word; a reduction of 2s. 6d. and 1s. 8d. per word on the rates formerly charged via Eastern. Corresponding reductions came into force for America generally.

An ordinary deferred telegram system has been instituted with a maximum delay of 24 hours at half the charge for ordinary cable messages, also a system of "Week-end letter" cable messages at a charge of 9½d. per word with a minimum charge of 15s.

The average number of messages transmitted to and from New Zealand prior to the opening of the Pacific cable was about 425 per day. The present average is about 780 a day by both routes.

To the advent of the Pacific cable is to be credited the general reduction of rates and the improvement in the cable services generally. The reduced rates based on the present traffic, it is estimated, mean a saving of over £2,500,000 a year to business firms and other users of the cables between New Zealand and other parts of the world.

In the year ending 31st March, 1914, excluding the value of Government messages, the revenue was £574,786 (including telephone exchange and other telegraph receipts); number of messages 10,694,032 (of which number 10,594,556 were private or press messages). From the 1st November, 1906, the inland rate on ordinary telegrams was reduced from 6½d. for the first twelve words and 1½d. each additional word to ½d. each word, with a minimum charge of 6½d. The principal towns have telephone exchanges. In March, 1914, there were 61 exchanges and 177 sub-exchanges in operation.

There are five New Zealand stations for the transmission of telegrams by radio-telegraphy. These provide adequately for the needs of shipping around the coasts, and secure communication between Chatham Islands and New Zealand.

Tramways have been established in all the principal towns in New Zealand, and Dunedin has, in addition, three cable lines leading to high-lying suburbs, and Wellington an incline line. The ordinary tramways are in some few cases worked by steam motors, but electric power is more generally employed. The cable tramways are practically on the same system as those in San Francisco.

Auckland, Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, Invercargill, Napier and Wanganui have electric tramway systems on the overhead principle.

The total expenditure by the General Government on the construction of roads and bridges from the inauguration of the Public Works policy in 1870, till the end of March, 1914, amounted to £9,985,250.

The Government has also expended about £997,250, on road and bridge works on gold-fields and £604,796 on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels, also £228,910 in aiding works on the gold-fields.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations; Auckland, Napier, Lyttelton, and Invercargill have pumping schemes, but the others are supplied by gravitation.

All the principal towns in the Dominion have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas. In Wellington the streets are illuminated by the electric light, as also are the parliamentary buildings and many private houses and business establishments.

The Government has in progress an important scheme for the development of electrical energy from water power at Lake Coleridge in Canterbury. About 10,000 horse power will be transmitted to Christchurch, where it will be utilised for tramway, lighting, industrial, manufacturing, and railway traction purposes. The scheme has been designed and the whole of the work is being carried out under the direct control of the Government. It is expected to be in operation by 1st November, 1914.

Dunedin is lighted by electricity generated by water power from the Waipori stream, under the control of the City Corporation, which also supplies electrical energy from the same sources for industrial and manufacturing purposes.

Other towns with electrical installations for street and private lighting are Auckland, Rotorua, Napier, Hastings, New Plymouth,
Stratford, Inglewood, Hawera, Patea, Reefton, Ross, Christchurch, Timaru, Gore, Mataura, Te Aroha, Waitara, Eketahuna, Ashburton and Bluff.

The coasts of the Dominion are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Lyttelton, Greymouth, Westport, New Plymouth and Napier. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.

Road and railway formation works are carried out under small contracts and by the co-operative system, under which the Government provides all materials and lets the work of construction to parties of labourers and artisans at rates fixed by Government officers on the ground. These rates are calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 9s. to 12s. per day for artisans, and from 9s. to 10s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day. Buildings and large bridges are built by contract, let after inviting tenders through the press.

Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England and Europe by direct steamers and via Vancouver, Brindisi, Naples, and San Francisco, and with all Australian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States, Canada, Uruguay, and Brazil.

Postage Rates.

The postage on letters inland is 1d. for the first 4 ounces, or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each succeeding 2 ounces or fraction thereof, and to such places as accept matter at the reduced rate, 1d. for each ounce or fraction thereof. The reduction (to 1d. per ounce) applies in any case to British possessions, and to a number of foreign countries which have agreed to deliver letters from New Zealand prepaid at 1d., without surcharge, although not in every case applying the rate reciprocally. The letter postage to other places beyond New Zealand is 2½d. for the first ounce, and 1½d. for each succeeding ounce, or fraction thereof. The minimum rate for newspapers printed and published in New Zealand, for the United Kingdom, is 1d. for each newspaper, irrespective of weight, but subject to the following conditions as to despatch:—if under 8 ounces, prepaid 1d., sent by first available route; if over 8 ounces, prepaid 1d., sent by direct steamers only. The rate for certain other British possessions is 1d. for each newspaper. The rate for newspapers not printed and published in New Zealand, addressed to the United Kingdom, is for each newspaper:—1d. for the first 4 ounces, and ½d. for each additional 2 ounces or fraction thereof. The inland rate for newspapers remains at ½d. each. The inland parcel post rates are:—3d. for the first lb. and 1½d. for each additional lb. up to a maximum weight of 11lb. To offices not served by railway, coach or steamer, the maximum weight is 5lb.

DEPENDENCIES OF NEW ZEALAND.*

COOK ISLANDS.

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth" and the Hervey Islands, Manuae, Te Au-o-Tu and Takutea by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

Until 1901 British authority was represented by a Resident who was paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reported direct to the Governor of that Dominion. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moss, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continued to enjoy self-government in such purely local affairs as it could properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government was composed of the Ariki, or Kings and Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, was the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court was established, and a law was passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts were subject to the approval of the Resident, who was also a Deputy and Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and Chief Justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands.

The Islands became part of the Dominion of New Zealand from the 11th June, 1901. The administration and laws were continued in force subject to the provisions of the Cook Islands Government Act, passed in that year.

Resident Commissioner at Rarotonga, H. W. Northcroft, N.Z.C.

RAROTONGA.

Distant from Auckland, 1,638 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 2,100 ft.; area, 25 square miles; population, 2,789.

Rarotonga is the most fertile and valuable of the Cook group, and it has the largest population. The island has been exceptionally favoured by nature, not only with delightful scenic attractions, but also with a remarkably rich and productive soil. The aborigines are very closely akin to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The seat and centre of the government of the Cook Islands—the double township of Avarua and Avatiu—is situated on the north or lee side of the island of Rarotonga, opposite two small openings in the coral reef. The former has the advantage of a boat harbour, where small craft can be moored in safety when the wind is not blowing in from the sea. The residence of the Commissioner is situated here.

The dwellings of the natives are built of coral concrete, as are also the Government offices.

Goods received from the Cook and other annexed islands are now treated as New Zealand produce, and not as imports. The total value of exports from the Cook islands for 1913 was 109,928l., of which 67,174l. represented trade with New Zealand. The principal items were: fresh fruit, 52,822l.; copra, 33,679l.; pearl-shell, 8,280l.; coffee, 970l.; coconuts, 2,893l.

* A full account of these Dependencies will be found in the "New Zealand Official Year Book," 1913, to which the Editors desire to express their acknowledgments.
Revenue and expenditure of the Cook and Northern Islands for the year 1913-14: Revenue, 11,723l.; expenditure, 10,194l.

MANGAIA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 110 miles; circumference, 30 miles; height, 656 ft.; area, 30 square miles; population, 1,471.

Physical Features.

Mangaia is the most southerly island of the Cook group, and is second in importance to Rarotonga.

Cocoonuts, bananas, oranges, limes, citrons and other fruits grow plentifully.

Resident Agent, J. C. Cameron.

ATIU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 374 ft.; area, 22 square miles; population, 812.

Resident Agent, D. B. Russell.

The Island.

Atiu resembles Mangaia in formation, being a raised mass of coral with high jagged cliffs facing the sea.

On the highest point of the central ridge cocoonuts, bananas, oranges, and coffee grow with the utmost luxuriance; and the kumera, one of the most valuable of South Sea vegetables, yields large crops. The cocoonut-palm grows well everywhere, but especially so on the coral rock formation.

MAUKE.

Distant from Rarotonga, 151 miles; circumference, 10 miles; height, about 60 ft.; area, 5½ square miles; population, 457.

Mauke is a low circular island about two miles across, lying to the north-east of Rarotonga. Like Mangaia and Atiu, it is surrounded by an unbroken fringing reef. It is marvellously fertile, and produce of considerable value and quantity is exported.

Resident Agent, W. S. Cooper.

MITIARO.

Distant from Rarotonga, 142 miles; circumference, 5 miles; height, about 50 ft.; area, 6 square miles; population, 199.

This island is a good instance of an elevated coral reef, thinly coated with sand and gravel of the same material. The surface is not more than six feet above high-water mark.

Resident Agent, Tou Ariki.

TAKUTEA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area, ½ square mile.

This island was presented to the Crown by the Ariki of Atiu to whom it belonged. It is a coral island, moderately fertile, and will be utilised as a Government plantation.

AITUTAKI.

Distance from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 14½ miles; height, 450 ft.; area, 7 square miles; population, 1,237.

The name includes the island anciently known as "Ara-ura," and some seven or eight smaller islands on the vast barrier reef. Some of these are volcanic, and would seem to have been small peaks on the lip of an extinct volcano, now submerged.

The island itself is pear-shaped, about four miles by two; its highest part being 450 feet high.

Copra is the chief production, and some of the best oranges and pineapples on the market are grown here.

The Aitutakians are naturally a hardy race, and industrious when away from their own homes. They are said to be the best sailors in the Cook group, and their services are much in demand for working the cargo on vessels at Tahiti. They make fans and mats, and are expert at plaiting various fibres for hatmaking.

Resident Agent, T. Duncan, J.P.

MANUAE AND TE AU-O-TU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area of Manuae, 2¼ square miles; population 29.

These two small islands are better known as the Hervey Group. They are situated about midway between Atiu and Aitutaki, and are owned by the people of the latter place.

The islands have been leased to Messrs. Bates and Gruning.

NIUE.

Distant from Rarotonga, 590 miles; circumference, 40 miles; height, 200 ft.; area, 100 square miles; population, 4,456, including 513 natives absent; census, 1911.

Niue, or Savage Island, was placed under a separate administration by an Amending Act of 1903. Is a long, low island, fringed with a misty cloud of fine spray. The shores being too deep and steep to support a barrier reef, the coastline is deprived of its protection. It is fertile, but fresh water is very scarce.

Much of the land is encumbered with a dense scrub of guava bush.

The orange, the cocoonut, the banana, and other tropical products grow well, and the lemon flourishes on the rocky shores. Recent experiments in cotton growing have been most successful and the product highly reported upon by the British Cotton Growing Association.

The natives of Niue are somewhat different in character from other Polynesians. They are very industrious, and the men are often engaged at Tonga and elsewhere as labourers. The girls and women plait hats, which are exported to New Zealand and Australia. They are keen traders, but are much averse to strangers obtaining a foothold in the island itself.

The exports for 1913 amounted to 12,170l., and the imports to 12,620l. The revenue for 1913-14 was 2,492l., and the expenditure 3,068l. The principal exports were copra, 9,993l., and hats, 1,651l.

Resident Commissioner, H. G. Cornwall.

PALMERSTON ATOLL.

Distant from Rarotonga, 277 miles; area, 1 square mile; population, 107; census, 1911.

The Palmerstons are situated upon an irregular ring of coral reef, measuring outside about four miles and a half by two miles and a half, just
awash with the tide. The narrow ring is about half a mile in width, and it supports eight little islets, nearly all covered with cocoanut palms. The largest of these is little more than half a mile in length and about a quarter of a mile wide.

Copra is the only article of export.

Resident Agent, J. Marsters.

Penrhyn.

Distant 740 miles from Rarotonga; area, 3 square miles; population 335.

This atoll is known to the Polynesians as Tongareva or Ma-ngaro-ngaro and is valuable only by reason of the existence of pearlshell beds in the extensive lagoon. The lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling pearlshell diving have been made.

The cocoanut crop is considerable. Fresh water is very scarce, and large concrete tanks have been built by the Administration in the various villages for storage of rain water.

Resident Agent, E. F. Hawk.

Suwarrow.

Distant from Rarotonga, 525 miles; area, ½ square mile.

Suwarrow is an atoll with a splendid lagoon, which produces a very good class of pearlshell. Leased to Capt. Harries, of Rarotonga.

Manihiki and Rakahanga.

Distant from Rarotonga, 650 and 670 miles respectively; area, each 2 square miles; population, Manihiki, 444; Rakahanga, 315.

Manihiki, or Humphrey, is nearly circular. Bêche-de-mer is obtained from the lagoon. The island occasionally suffers from drought and similar tanks to those at Penrhyn have been erected.

Rakahanga, or Rierson, is also an atoll.

The former has until lately produced a limited amount of pearlshell, but about the end of 1900 it was found that the beds were exhausted by over-fishing. The Manihiki lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling diving made as in the case at Penrhyn.

The only industry is now that of copra-making.

Resident Agent, H. Williams.

Pukapuka, or Danger Island.

Pukapuka is a small solitary atoll about three miles in diameter, which produces pearlshell. It is 720 miles from Rarotonga, and has an area of two square miles. The population is 490 persons.

Resident Agent, J. Dyer.

Education.

The education of the children living in the Cook and other islands is in the hands of the London Missionary Society, which provides some 2,500 children with education of an elementary character. At Tereora, in Rarotonga, the Mission supplies an English education for the children of those leading men that are willing to pay a small fee per annum.

To the above must be added the good work done by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who have established themselves in Rarotonga, and have some 80 pupils. At Niue the Island Government has erected a good school, which is in charge of Mr. W. C. Smith. The school is a residential one and the instruction given is similar to that of New Zealand State schools. There is also technical instruction.

Trade of Cook Islands.

Oranges and bananas have heretofore been the chief exports, and the latter are being extensively planted. The fruit trade is developing satisfactorily, but it is on the export of copra that dependence must chiefly be placed.
