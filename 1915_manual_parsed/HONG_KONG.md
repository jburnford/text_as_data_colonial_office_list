HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of isles situated off the south-eastern coast of China, the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its brc and abrupt peaks rising to the height of near 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles area about 32 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known the Lyceum Pass, which does not exceed half mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (28 square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1860 by the Government of China, and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutters Green, Apelchow, Middle, Round, and other islands.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with Chinese Government for the extension of Hong Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwang-tung, including Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be let for 99 years; a stipulation was included within the walled city of Kowloon (which lies outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong, but that within the remainder of the new leased territory Great Britain should have jurisdiction. In 1899 the Chinese officials ceased to exercise jurisdiction within Kowloon City which thereafter, by Her late Majesty's Order Council, was incorporated in the leased territ...
and became subject to British rule. The area of the mainland and Islands leased is about 359 square miles. A careful survey of the territory was completed in 1904. This new territory has its headquarters at Tai Po on an arm of Mirs Bay. A District Officer, who performs police and magisterial duties, resides there. The Southern district is in the charge of an Assistant District Officer.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'oeil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The city of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees. On the Praya West Reclamation, completed in 1903, some new and handsome buildings stand, and others are in course of erection.

The rainfall for 1913 was 83-73 inches as compared with 63-93 in 1912, and 90-55 in 1911. The average for the period 1884-1908 was 84-44 inches. In 1910 the mean maximum temperature ranged from 87°2 in June to 63°1 in January, and the mean minimum temperature from 79°7 in June to 55°9° in January. Typhoons are prevalent during the months July to October.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843. The additions subsequently obtained on the mainland have been noted above.

Hong Kong did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1913 being 309,680 (principally to and from the Straits); emigrants, 142,759; immigrants, 166,921, excluding to and from China ports.

Industry.

The position of the island has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandalwood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c. &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are many manufactories, which are rapidly increasing in number and importance, producing rope, sugar, rum, beer, paper, vermilion, sauce, bricks, tiles and cement, bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping. There is a considerable boat-building industry chiefly in the hands of Chinese.

The natural products of Hong Kong are few and unimportant. There is little land suitable for tillage, and nothing is grown but a little rice and some vegetables near the outlying villages. There are large granite quarries, both on the island and in Kowloon. A bed of fire clay exists at Deep Water Bay, and bricks and earthenware pipes are manufactured from it. A dairy farm supplies fresh meat, poultry, eggs, and milk. The fishing in the waters of the Colony is good and is a source of livelihood to a vast number of Chinese.

The new Territories have extensive cultivable land, on which are grown sugar, rice, vegetables, lychees, pineapples, &c. The cultivation is entirely in the hands of the Chinese villagers and it is doubtful whether European enterprise would be successful. A very rich deposit of iron has been found in the hills, and promises to be very remunerative.

Shipping.

Hong Kong being a free port, it is not possible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected may be approximately estimated from the amount of shipping which has steadily grown, with one or two slight fluctuations, for over twenty years.

The total tonnage entering and clearing during the year 1913 amounted to 37,742,982 tons, being an increase, compared with 1912, of 1,007,833 tons. There were 244,892 arrivals of 18,891,953 tons, and 245,336 departures of 18,851,029 tons.

Of British ocean-going tonnage 4,215,369 tons entered, and 4,234,164 tons cleared.

Of British river steamers 2,040,244 tons entered, and 2,038,391 tons cleared.

Of foreign ocean-going tonnage 4,658,437 tons entered, and 4,614,198 tons cleared.

Of foreign river steamers 475,112 tons entered, and 474,216 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons trading to ports outside the colony, 93,722 tons entered, and 95,281 tons cleared.

Of junks in foreign trade 1,447,027 tons entered, and 1,435,491 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons plying within the waters of the Colony 5,360,302 tons entered and 5,360,302 tons cleared.

Of junks in local trade 601,740 tons entered, and 598,986 tons cleared.

Thus in Foreign Trade:—

**Currency and Banking.**

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 2nd Feb., 1895):

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. British dollar.
3. The Hong Kong dollar, half-dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
4. Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
5. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint 2,108,054 dollars and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of $402,671. There were obtained from England, and put into circulation up to 31st Dec., 1908, subsidiary coins (which now include half dollars) to the nominal value of $43,999,830, but of these coins to the value of $7,607,459 have since been withdrawn.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now, and of the coins imported from England it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent. remain in the Colony.

The principal Banks are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Ltd., the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Mercantile Bank of India, the International Banking Corporation, the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, the Russo-Asiatic Bank, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Netherlands-India Commercial Bank, the Netherlands Trading Society, the Banque de l'Indo-Chine, and the Credit-Foncier d'Extrême Orient. The first named bank conducts a Savings Bank. There are also a large number of Chinese banks.

The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Mercantile Bank of India are authorised to issue notes in the Colony, the total circulation amounting to $24,551,752 at the close of 1913.

Local weights and measures are the following:

1 tael = 1½ oz.; 1 picul = 133½ lbs. (avoirdupois); 7½ catties = 1 imperial gallon; 1,000 Chinese cash = 1 dollar.

**Means of Communication.**

Hong Kong is extremely well situated as regards telegraphic communication, in all directions, with all parts of the world. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company (British) by means of two cables to Singapore, via Labuan and Cape St. James respectively, provide good connections with Europe, via India, with Australasia and with the other British Colonies and possessions. By their cable to Manila connection is made with the direct American cable, thence to San Francisco. Two cables to Shanghai, belonging respectively to the Eastern Extension and to the Great Northern (Danish) Companies, via Foochow and Amoy respectively, give a good connection with Shanghai (North China), Japan and Russia; and the system of the Great Northern Telegraph Company gives a good service to Europe, via Asiatic Russia.

**Docks.**

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company, who were aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885, under the Colonial Docks Act, have three dry docks and two slips at their Kowloon establishment, one dry dock at Mong Kok Tsui, on the western side of the Kowloon Peninsula, and two at Aberdeen, on the south side of the island of Hong Kong. The Admiralty have built a large dock in the Naval establishment in the middle of the City of Victoria, and Messrs. Butterfield & Swire a still larger one at Quarry Bay, just inside the Lysemun Pass.

Besides these there are several building slips and repairing shops owned by Europeans and Chinese in various parts of the Colony.

* Including 9,922 Conservancy and Dust Boats of 634,090 tons.
† Including 10,026 Conservancy and Dust Boats of 607,376 tons.
Hong Kong possesses unrivalled steam communication. The P. & O. S. N. Co. and the M. M. Co. convey the European mail weekly, the Norddeutscher Lloyd Co. maintain a regular fortnightly mail service between Bremen and Hong Kong, the P. M. S. S. Co., and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha maintain a mail service with San Francisco, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. a regular mail service with Vancouver, B.C., a regular line has been established by the Northern Pacific S. S. Co. to Tacoma, and Portland, Oregon, and the Portland and Asiatic S. N. Co. also run a line of steamers to Portland, the Great Northern Steamship Co. maintain a monthly service to Seattle with ships of over 20,000 tons gross register, the Eastern and Australian S. S. Co., the China Navigation Co. and the Norddeutscher Lloyd keep up a frequent but rather irregular service with the Australian Colonies, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha maintains service to Europe, India, Australia, and the United States (Seattle). In addition to these several great lines of merchant steamers run between ports in Great Britain and Hong Kong, of which the China Mutual S. S. Co., Ocean S. S. Co., and the Glen, Warrack, Mogul, Ben Union, and Shell lines are the most conspicuous. The Austrian Lloyd's steamers also ply from Trieste to Hong Kong, those of the Hamburg-Amerika line from Hamburg, and the Navigazione Generale Italiana Company's steamers run monthly from Genoa. Regular steam communication between Java and Hong Kong has been established by the Indo-China S. N. Co.'s and the Java-China-Japan Line. Between the ports on the east coast of China, Formosa and Hong Kong the steamers of the Douglas S. S. Co. ply regularly twice a week, and those of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha weekly, and there is constant steam communication with Hoihow, Manila, Saigon, Haiphong, Tourane, Bangkok, Borneo, etc. With Shanghai, Tientsin, and the ports of Japan there is frequent communication by steamers of the Indo-China S. N. Co., China Navigation, and other lines, in addition to the English, French and German mail steamers, which leave weekly. With Calcutta there are services by the Indo-China S. N. Co. and the Apcar Line, about once a fortnight by each line. Between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton there is a daily steam service, and tri-weekly steamers as far as Wuchow on the West River.

A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels. An electric tramway from Shaukiwan to Kennedy Town, along the whole extent of the city, was completed and opened in July, 1904. The island possesses few roads available for vehicular traffic except in the town of Victoria, but admirable roads, from which exquisite views may be obtained, wind in every direction among the hills, and a good and practically level road runs round a great part of the island. The usual means of conveyance is by boat, chair, and 'ricksha'. There are good roads in Kowloon, and a road from Kowloon ferry runs to Tai Po on an arm of Mirs Bay. A road has been constructed from Castle Peak to Sha Tau Kok connecting the South-eastern and North-western extremities of the New Territories; the length is about 23½ miles. A railway was completed in the year 1910 from Kowloon to the Chinese frontier, where it joins the line from Canton. Telephonic communication is available to all parts of the Colony.

British Postal Orders are issued and paid in Hong Kong.

**Education.**

In previous years the Government control over education has been confined to the Government and grant schools, of which details are given below; but in 1913 an Ordinance was passed, the effect of which has been to bring more than 500 private schools under Government supervision.

The number of Government schools and schools which receive grants from Government is 64, of which 21 are English schools, i.e. schools in which the English language is the medium of instruction, and 43 are vernacular schools. There are two schools which are reserved for children of European-British parentage.

The total number of pupils in average attendance at Government and grant schools was 6,460 in 1913. Of these 2,262 were in Government, and 4,198 in grant schools; 4,184 pupils received instruction in English, and 2,276 in the vernacular. The proportion of boys to girls was 3,898 to 2,562.

A technical institute supplies instruction in commercial and technical subjects. The total enrolment in 1913 was 387.

The University of Hong Kong contains nearly 100 students. There are at present three faculties, of medicine, engineering and arts. The standard aimed at is that of the University of London.

**Revenue.**

About one-fourth of the revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly and one-sixth from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes: 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria, the Hill District, Kowloon Point, Yaumati and Hung Hom; and rates varying from 7 to 12½ per cent. in the outlying villages. The annual rates payable on the valuation for 1913-14 are $1,592,180, an increase of $19,539 on the previous valuation. The remainder is derived from licences, land revenue, stamps, duties, and fees. The duties on intoxicating liquors are expected to realize $715,000 in 1914, Land Sales to reach $250,000, Stamp Revenue to reach $1,050,000, and Postal Revenue $440,000. The total Revenue for 1914 is estimated at $9,752,960.
Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19th January, 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six official and two unofficial members, besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of seven official and six unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (two being usually Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members vacate their seats after six years from date of appointment. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances, of which a revised edition to 1912 has been issued. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901.
