SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The territory known as the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone is an area of some 27,925 square miles, roughly circular in shape, lying between 6° 55' and 10° of N. lat., and 10° 20' and 13° 28' of W. long. The sea coast, 210 miles in length, extends from Kiragba at about lat. 9° N., on the border of French Guinea, to the Mano River at lat. 6° 55' N. on the border of the Republic of Liberia.

The Colony portion of this area, i.e. the territories acquired by the Crown by Treaty of Cession or otherwise consists of the following:—the Sierra Leone Peninsula in which is situated Freetown (the seat of Government), Sherbro Island, the islands of Tasso, Bananas, Turtles, York, Buns, Shaye and other small islets, the Lower Lokko and Matoki Chiefdoms in the Northern Province, and the Bumpe, Kagboro, Bagru, Mano Bagru, Timdel, Bendu, Cha, Mongobe Bullon, Messi Krim, and part of the Manosa Krim Chiefdoms in the Southern Province. The Crown has also acquired a strip of land, varying in depth from a quarter of a mile to one mile throughout the whole coast line not included in the areas specified above. Of these areas the Peninsula of Sierra Leone, Tasso Island, Banana Islands, York Island, and the township of Bonthe in Sherbro Island, only, are administered as strictly Colony; the other areas are administered as part of the Protectorate.

History.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Nembanai and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor, of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs, and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government." This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 22nd August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who from various circumstances had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the Colony was used as a settlement for Africans rescued from slave-ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves. The territory of the Colony received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on the 10th July, 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the Colony; and in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Kwaia, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Kwaia country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the Treaty of Cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with various Chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other Treaties of Cession were made from time to time.

On August 21st, 1896, a Proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the Hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate, which, by Order-in-Council is divided into two Provinces as follows:—

Northern Province Districts.—Port Loko, Karene, Bombali, Kambia and Koinadugu.

Southern Province Districts.—Moyamba, Kono, Kenema, Kailahun, Bo, Bonthe and Pujehun.

General Description.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of volcanic mountains, running parallel to the sea from N.N.W. to S.S.E., the summits of which, in the Picket Hill, Sugar Loaf and Leicester Mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of norite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The coastal strip is flat and low-lying and the river estuaries, below high tide mark, are bounded by extensive mangrove swamps. The western and southern part of the Protectorate consists of rolling wooded country, broken in places by ranges of hills rising to 1,000 ft. or more. The ground rises to the north and east to form an upland plateau having a general elevation of about 1,500 ft. The Sula and Kangari hills rise to nearly 3,000 ft., while to the east, near the French Guinea frontier, Bintumane Peak and the summits of the Binwa range rise to above 6,000 ft. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa the country is well watered by rivers and streams. The principal rivers of Sierra Leone which empty themselves into the Atlantic Ocean are the Great and Little Scarcies, the Rokel or Seli, the Tong or Taia, the Ribbi, the Bum or Sewa, the Moa and the Mano, most of which are navigable by small craft for several miles.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 2,900 feet above the sea. In 1921 it contained 44,142 inhabitants. It possesses the best harbour in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining have a population (including Freetown and its Districts) of 85,163. It yields only a small quantity of exportable commodities, but ginger and coffee thrive if well looked after. The extent of the territory is, however, small (256 square miles), and the generally rocky soil is not very well adapted for cultivation.

Considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piasava, with other articles of lesser importance are exported via Bonthe in the Southern Province.

Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, cocoanuts, bene seed, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, cocoa, rice, and other tropical products.
Alluvial platinum deposits occur near York, and are being worked on a small scale. Alluvial gold deposits are being worked in the Protectorate and are giving encouraging results.

Chromite has been discovered in several parts of the Protectorate and the most promising deposit, occurring in the Kambui Hills near Hangha, is being actively prospected.

A recently discovered deposit of diamonds in Kono District is now being prospected.

Deposits of iron ore have been discovered, and steps are being taken to work and export the ore on a large scale.

The population of the Protectorate was in 1921 estimated at 1,456,148 and is composed of the following tribes:

Northern Province { Temnes, Limbas, Susus,
Lokkos, Fulhas, Mandingo-
goes, Korankos, Yalunkas.
Southern Province { Mendes, Sherbroes, Konnos,
Krima, Gallinas, Gollas,
Vais, a few Kissis.

Constitution.

A Charter, issued on May 27th, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, established a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, revoked so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter, dated 17th of December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. By letters patent, dated 3rd April, 1913, and Royal Instructions, dated 4th May, 1922, there were constituted an Executive Council composed of the Officer in command of the troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and a Legislative Council, composed of the members of the Executive Council and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On March 7, 1913, an Imperial Order-in-Council was issued providing for the administration of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The Order applies to the territories, not being portions of the Colony of Sierra Leone, lying between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude and the tenth and fourteenth degrees of west longitude, and beginning at the extreme southerly point of the Colony on the Anglo-Liberian boundary, as delimited under the provisions of the Anglo-Liberian Conventions, November 11, 1885, and January 21, 1911.

The Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of Sierra Leone is also the Governor of the Protectorate. Authority is given to the Governor by Ordinances passed in the Legislative Council to exercise and provide for giving effect to the powers and jurisdiction acquired by the Crown in Sierra Leone.

Letters Patent, dated the 28th January, 1924, revoked those issued on the 3rd April, 1913, and made fresh provision for the appointment of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and instructions issued under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet on the same date cancelled those of the 3rd April, 1913, and 4th May, 1922. An Order of the King in Council dated the 16th January, 1924, provided for a new and considerably enlarged Legislative Council, introducing an elective element and direct representation of Protectorate interests into the constitution of that Council for the first time in the history of Sierra Leone.

Climate.

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The shade temperature varies during the year from about 62° to 97°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur at the commencement and close of the rainy season. They are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp. The rainfall in Freetown for the year 1929 was 114·51 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from N.E. to S.E.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is trying, but conditions have been greatly improved in recent years through the efforts of the Medical and Sanitary Services, and if ordinary precautions are taken the risk of contracting malarial fever can be much reduced.

Vegetable Products.

The principal products exported from Sierra Leone are palm kernels, palm oil, piaassava, beneseed (sesame), ground nuts, kola nuts, ginger and hides. The chief agricultural work lies in the cultivation of rice and cassava for local consumption. The kola tree is found near almost every village, and from its product a considerable portion of the revenue of the native inhabitants is derived. Gum copal is also collected.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

The inhabitants of Freetown and the Colony generally are traders and shop-keepers, and do little in the way of agriculture beyond the planting of cassava. In the Protectorate the inhabitants plant "farms," chiefly of rice and cassava, and collect natural products for sale to the various merchants and traders of the Colony. They also weave "country cloths," many of which are of a good texture and handsome design. There is also a flourishing industry of mat making, basket making, etc., and in the Northern Province, a certain amount of ornate leather work is produced. The fishing industry at Sherbro is of considerable importance, vast quantities of dried fish being taken inland. Syrians are now an important element in Freetown, where they form a large portion of the shopkeepers. In the Protectorate their numbers are increasing and they are responsible for much of the motor transport on the Protectorate roads.
SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The territory known as the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone is an area of some 27,925 square miles, roughly circular in shape, lying between 6° 58' and 10° of N. lat., and 10° 20' and 13° 28' of W. long. The sea coast, 210 miles in length, extends from Kiragba at about lat. 9° N., on the border of French Guinea, to the Mano River at lat. 6° 55' N. on the border of the Republic of Liberia.

The Colony portion of this area, i.e. the territories acquired by the Crown by Treaty of Cession or otherwise consists of the following:—the Sierra Leone Peninsula in which is situated Freetown (the seat of Government), Sherbro Island, the islands of Tasco, Bananas, Turtles, York, Buina, Shaye and other small islets, the Lower Lokko and Matoki Chiefdoms in the Northern Province, and the Bumpe, Kagboro, Bagru, Mano Bagru, Timdel, Bendu, Cha, Mongoba Bullon, Meesi Krim, and part of the Manoase Krim Chiefdoms in the Southern Province. The Crown has also acquired a strip of land, varying in depth from a quarter of a mile to one mile throughout the whole coast line not included in the areas specified above. Of these areas the Peninsula of Sierra Leone, Tasco Island, Banana Islands, York Island, and the township of Bonthe in Sherbro Island, only, are administered as strictly Colony; the other areas are administered as part of the Protectorate.

The staple food of the inhabitants is rice and foofoo made from cassava.

The products from the Protectorate which constitute the principal exports are palm kernels, palm oil, kola nuts, piassava, peppers, hides, cocoa, ginger. Attempts to grow American Upland Cotton, made originally with the aid of the British Cotton Growing Association, failed on account of the unsuitable climate, but local varieties of cotton are successfully grown in considerable quantities. The principal imports are tobacco, cotton goods, spirits, furniture, groceries, etc., and hardware.

The import duties, which are non-differential, are mainly specific; but many important articles such as cotton goods and wearing apparel are liable to an ad valorem duty (20 per cent.). There are also export duties on palm kernels and kola nuts.

Currency and Banking.

Besides English currency, West Africa silver coins (2s., 1s., 6d. and 3½) were put into circulation in 1913, and alloy coins of similar denominations in 1920. Currency Notes of the value of 20s. and 10s. were introduced in 1916 and of 2s. in 1917, and 1s. in 1919, but the last two denominations are not now current. The Bank of British West Africa has two branches in the Colony and some agencies in the Protectorate. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial & Overseas) Ltd. also is established in Freetown. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882.

Education.

From the beginning of 1928 Primary Education in the Colony passed under the new scheme of amalgamating Mission Schools, thus building up stronger centres, and in a measure providing separate schools for Infants and Standard Classes. The payment of Teachers' Salaries having been taken over by government, much closer attention is being made to qualifications, and with the additional supervision now provided, the grade of work should steadily improve. Education is not compulsory. The Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Mission have a College at Fourah Bay, affiliated to Durham University, which prepares students for the Degrees of that University. The College also undertakes the training of Male Teachers for Primary Schools. The training of Female Teachers for Primary Schools is now undertaken by the Wesleyan Missionary Society at its College at Wilberforce. In the Protectorate, while the old system still obtains, plans are under consideration for the complete re-organisation of all schools. A Government school for the sons and nominees of native chiefs was established at Bo in the Kenema District of the Protectorate on 1st March, 1906, under European supervision. The number of pupils at the close of 1930 was 153. There is also a Government Model School in Freetown at which 287 pupils attended in 1930. An agricultural training college for vernacular teachers was established in 1919 at Njala in the Protectorate. The school was transferred with all but its two junior classes to the new Central Protectorate College which is being set up at Koyeima; 80 pupils were enrolled in 1930. There are also 10 Government Rural Schools in the Protectorate, with a roll of 386 pupils.

The total number of children being instructed in the Government and assisted Mission Schools in the Colony and Protectorate was as follows:—

| Primary Schools | 12,418 |
| Prince of Wales' School | 82 |
| Secondary Schools (including 1 un-assisted) | 1,302 |
| Bo School | 153 |
| Government Model School | 287 |
| Protectorate Central College | 80 |
| Government Rural Schools (Protectorate) | 386 |
| Industrial Schools | 586 |

Total | 15,293 |

Means of Communication.

Mail steamers leave Liverpool for Freetown and Freetown for Plymouth and Liverpool every fortnight. The passage takes about 10 days.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively. A wireless telegraphic station was opened in 1913.

The main line of the Sierra Leone Government Railway, which was the first Railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the Freetown terminus to Pendembu in the Railway District, a distance of 227½ miles. The number of stations and flag stations is 53. From Bauya Junction, 64½ miles from Freetown, a branch line runs to Makeui, a distance of 83 miles. The gauge of the Railway is 2 ft. 6 in.

The total railway receipts for 1930 were £190,577.; the working expenses for the same year were £198,539.

There are 1,912 miles of combined telegraph and telephone lines in operation.

There are about 700 miles of motorable roads in the Protectorate and the main thoroughfares in Freetown and its vicinity are motorable.

The Sherbro river is navigable for over 20 miles (up to York Island), the Sierra Leone, or Rokell river, for 40 miles (as far as Magbile).

For six months of the year the Kittam River is navigable for launches to Moplama (about 80 miles) all the year and for six months to Pujehun. Much of the produce from the Northern Sherbro District is thus transported to Bonthe.

There are 69 post offices and postal agencies. The estimated number of letters, &c., handled in 1930 was 2,014,666; of parcels 44,614, of which the Inland Post dealt with 1,031,461 and 14,732 respectively.

The rates of postage are as follows:—

| Letters, Post Newspapers, per ½ oz. Cards. Books, etc., per 2 oz. |
|---|---|
| Internal | 1½ | ½ |
| To U.K. British | 2½ per oz. | 1½ |
| Dominions and Colonies | (1½d. each additional oz.) | |
| To Other Countries | 3½ | 1½ |

(1½d. each additional oz.)
Parcels: maximum weight 2½ lbs. for places inland and to certain countries which accept heavy parcels; 11 lbs. other countries.

Inland, 6d. for 2 lbs.; 3d. each additional lb.

Gt. Britain, N. Ireland—Up to 3 lbs., 2s. 3d.; 7 lbs., 3s. 6½; 11 lbs., 4s. 9d.; 22 lbs., 7s.; British W. A. Colonies, 2s., 3s., 4s., and 7s. respectively.

Parcels for other countries are forwarded through the U.K.

British Imperial Postal Orders are issued and paid in the Colony; there is also an Inland and Foreign Money Order Service.

At the close of 1930 the Post Office Savings Bank held £2,796,120 to the credit of 8,005 depositors.
