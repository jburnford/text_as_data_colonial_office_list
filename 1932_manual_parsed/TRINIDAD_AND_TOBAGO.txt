mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands and Venezuela is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1596, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago at the census of 1921 was 365,913. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish. There is also a large number of East Indians, totalling 130,542. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of seven members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted by Letters Patent and an Order in Council which came into operation on 21st August, 1924. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, nine nominated official members, six nominated unofficial members and seven elected members. Trinidad is divided into six electoral districts, each returning one member. Tobago forms the seventh electoral district.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The climate of Trinidad is tropical and may be divided into two seasons, a dry season from January to the middle of May, with an average rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December, with an average of 8 inches per month. The coolest months of the year are December to April. The average temperature during the day is 84 and during the night 74. The average rainfall in 1930, from records taken at 78 stations, was 64'13 ins. The climate is healthy and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided reasonable precautions are taken. Hurricanes are unknown.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising to 3,000 feet; the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1931, 70,077), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1929, 34 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 21,234 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

Production and Industry, Trade and Customs.

The quantity and value of the principal products exported during the year 1930 were:

| Product       | Quantity     | Value   |

| Petrol Spirit | 53,332,576 lbs | 1,204,902 |
| Refined Kerosene | 1,807,916 lbs | 50,913  |

Sugar.—The sugar crop yielded 69,139 tons in 1930.

Canes are grown not only by the Estates but also by Cane Farmers, who sell usually on a sliding scale, to the Factories.

Coconuts—The coconut industry continues to expand. The value of the exports of coconuts, copra and coconut oil in 1930 being £97,733l. compared with £81,455l. in 1929.

(a) Re-exports 10,480,733 lbs. of a value of 227,733l.
(b) " 83,369 "
(c) " 44,033 gallons "
(d) " 3,441 "
Asphalt.—The asphalt lake, 114 acres in extent, situated in the Ward of La Brea, was first leased as a whole in 1888 for 21 years. The lease was renewed for a further period of 21 years from the 1st February, 1909. In February, 1925, a fresh lease of the lake comprising 109 acres was made to the Trinidad Lake Asphalt Limited, for 21 years, from the 1st February, 1930, on payment of the following Royalties and Export Duties:

For each ton of Crude Pitch or Asphaltum a Royalty of 2s. 6d. and an Export Duty of 5s.

For each ton of Dried Pitch or Asphaltum a Royalty of 3s. 6d. and an Export Duty of 6s. 11d.

The quantity of Asphalt produced during 1930 was 187,859 tons as against 219,663 tons in 1929.

The quantity of Asphalt exported during 1930 was 118,055 tons of the value of £313,397l., and yielding a revenue of £58,473l., as compared with 164,311½ tons exported in 1929 of a value of £432,085l. and yielding a revenue of £81,521l.

Petroleum.—At the close of 1930 there were fourteen Companies actively engaged in the exploitation of oil in the Colony. These Companies, having a total share capital of more than £14,000,000, held over 137,000 acres of Crown Lands under licenses and leases, of which approximately 125,000 acres were held under mining lease. In addition, appreciable areas of private lands are held. Up to 30th January, 1902, oil rights were not reserved by the Government when disposing of Crown Land, but after that year all Crown grants reserve the oil rights to the Crown. There are, consequently, three categories of oil lands, viz., lands disposed of prior to 1902 in which the oil rights rest in the surface owner. Land sold since that date in which the oil rights are reserved to the Crown, and lands where both the surface and the underlying oil remain the property of the Crown.

The principal oil producing companies are the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Fyzabad, Barrackpore, etc.; the United British Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Point Fortin, Parry Lands, etc.; the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Petroleum Development Company, Limited, from Crown Lands in the Ward of Oropuche; the Apex (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and Private Lands at Fyzabad; Siparia; the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaqueite and Guapo; the Kern (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Guapo, the Trinidad Oilfields Operating Co., Ltd., from private lands at Palo Seco, Fyzabad and San Francique, the Trinidad Petroleum Development Co., Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Naparima, Palo Seco and Fyzabad, the Venezuelan Consolidated Oilfields, Ltd., from private lands at Fyzabad, and Palo Seco and the Fyzabad Dome Oilfields from private lands at Fyzabad. There are five refineries at work in the Colony situated at Pointe-a-Pierre, Point Fortin, Brighton and Tabaqueite, and La Brea, and all grades of petroleum products from petrol to road oil are produced. The total quantity of oil produced during 1930 was 329,661,745 gallons, an increase of 24,613,925 gallons over the production for 1929. Of this total, 184,112,810 gallons were from Crown Lands or lands in which the oil rights belonged to the Crown. The Royalty paid by operating companies on oil, won from Crown rights during the year 1930, amounted to £77,260l., as against £74,937l. in 1929, and wayleaves to £8,585l. as against £8,884l. in 1929. The quantity of crude oil and products exported amounted to 268,758,245 gallons valued at £2,790,695l. as against 288,505,805 gallons valued at £3,051,450l. in 1929.

Fruit.—Increased attention is being given to the possibility of establishing an export trade in fruit. A Fruit Growers' Association has been formed for the purpose of developing the fruit industry. Exports during the year 1930 were valued at £27,540l.

Better prices have given renewed vigour to the lime trade. Several factories have commenced operations within recent years in Trinidad, and one was formed in 1930 in Tobago.

The cultivation of Para rubber has been successfully carried out on one estate.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,367,236 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1930, was estimated to be approximately 588,400 acres. About 380,000 acres are under cultivation.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. About one-third, and one-fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom, and the United States of America respectively.

Under the Customs Tariff, goods of Empire origin are admitted at a preferential rate of duty, the principal items being entitled to a preference of 50% of the general rate of duty. Approximately one-half the list of items on the tariff are chargeable with duty ad valorem, the remainder, including all high duty goods, being subject to specific duties.

The following tables show the direction of the import and export trade of the Colony for 1930:

Trinidad Line, Western Ocean Steamship Corporation, Prince Line, Ocean Dominion Steamship Corporation, Transatlantica Italiana, Royal Netherlands West India Mail, Canadian National Steamers, Aluminium Line, Orinoco Line, Nourse Line, Hamburg-Amerika Line, Prince Line and the Horne Line. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

In addition an increasing number of steamers call to load oil cargoes, or to take in coal or fuel oil for bunker purposes. During the winter months a number of tourist ships call.

Aerial services were established in the Colony in 1929 by two American Companies, viz.: the Pan American Airways, Incorporated, and the New York, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires Line, and seaplanes now ply from Miami, Florida, via Porto Rico and the Northern Islands to the Colony and thence to South America, a weekly service in either direction being maintained by the companies in question.

In August, 1930, the Pan American Airways Inc., and the New York, Rio and Buenos Aires Line were amalgamated. A weekly air mail service to Venezuela has been established.

The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government and in dollars by the public, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1903 an Ordinance providing for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been issued, the total value in circulation at 31st December, 1930, amounting to 122,300£.

Government Savings Banks are established in 35 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1930, was 37,906, with deposits amounting to 470,273£. The savings banks are largely made use of by the East Indians, of whom at the 31st December, 1930, there were 12,651 depositors. The amount deposited by this section of the community during the year is estimated at 70,546£.

The Commercial Banks are (1) Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., with a note circulation in the Colony estimated at 1,500,000£.; (2) the Royal Bank of Canada, with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of 1,500,000£.; (3) The Canadian Bank of Commerce, with an authorized note circulation of £750,000; (4) Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company, Limited, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce have Savings bank branches and pay the same rate of interest as is paid by the Government Savings Bank, viz.: 3 per cent. The Bank of Messrs. Gordon Grant and Co., Limited, is not a bank of issue. In addition to the above Banks there is the Trinidad Co-operative Bank, an institution established in 1914, for the encouragement of thrift.

Education.

At the close of 1930 there were 287 elementary and intermediate schools in the Colony, 43 being Government and 244 assisted schools. There were 251 schools in Trinidad and 36 in Tobago.

The number of pupils on the roll in December, 1930, was 64,167, of whom 35,661 were boys and 28,506 were girls. The average daily attendance was 41,093, or 63·5 per cent. of the number on roll. As compared with the previous year there was an increase of 776 on the roll, or 8 per cent., and of 676 in average attendance or 1·7 per cent. The number of teachers and pupil teachers employed was 1,769 (1,743 in 1929).

The total expenditure on education during the year 1930, deducting the amount received in school and examination fees, was 149,968£. 14s. 3d. compared with 137,625£. 3s. 7d. in 1929.

Secondary Education.

The following Colleges afford facilities for the higher education of boys:—The Queen’s Royal College and its affiliated institutions, the St. Mary’s College in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima College in San Fernando, the Bishop’s High School in Tobago. The St. Joseph’s Convent and the St. Hilary’s High School in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima Girls’ High School at San Fernando, which are also affiliated to the Queen’s Royal College, provide similar education for girls.

The affiliated institutions work under the same curriculum as the Queen’s Royal College, and receive a Government grant-in-aid.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institution for the instruction of the blind.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealander settlers were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north...
Municipalities.

In 1914 Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.

The next town and port is San Fernando, about 30 miles south from Port of Spain. The population at the census of 1921 was 10,610.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population at 1921 census, 4,210). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1930, was £86,633., the expenditure, £96,488., and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was £79,207l. on the 31st December, 1930. This includes the loan of £4,000. for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

Means of Communication.

The service to Tobago is maintained by the Government coastal steamers "Tobago" and "Trinidad." The "Tobago" plys between Trinidad and Tobago five times per fortnight, going every alternate week by the northern and southern routes. The "Tobago" is mainly for passengers and the "Trinidad" for cargo.

The railway system consists of the following:

- The Port of Spain—Arima—Sangre Grande line (opened in 1897) 29 miles, along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast.
- The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1880, San Fernando in 1882, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.
- The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabasquite in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction (14½ miles from Port of Spain) and running in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.
- The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Marabella Junction (33 miles from Port of Spain) and running in an easterly direction to Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles, and
- The Cipero tramway, to the south of San Fernando, also proceeding by another route to Princes Town.

The total length of this system is now 123 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 6 trains daily each way.

In connection with the railway, a steamer makes one trip a week between Port-of-Spain, San Fernando and La Brea (near the celebrated Pitch Lake), the Oilfields, Cedros, and to the south-western point of the Island at Icacos, stopping at eight intermediate places along the coast, and carrying passengers and goods. This steamer also makes three trips a week each-way between Port-of-Spain and the Bocas entrance to the Gulf, including the Islands to the West of Port-of-Spain.

The railway stations are in telegraphic communication one with the other on all parts of the system, giving a total length of about 118 miles of telegraph and about 14 miles of telephone lines. There is also a service telephone along the Cipero Section between San Fernando and Princes Town.

The total receipts from the railways, railway steamers, telegraphs and telephones for the year 1930 amounted to £140,409., and the working expenses to £167,338., exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to £99,219. There has been a considerable falling off in the Railway receipts during the last few years, due to competition from motor omnibuses and lorries.

The total number of passengers carried during 1930 was 2,150,529. The total tonnage of goods (including canes, 117,393 tons) was 303,779 tons.

The Island is intersected by numerous roads either metalled or gravelled, and capable of carrying fairly heavy motor traffic. Many of the most important roads have been reconstructed in recent years, and their surfaces treated with Trinidad Road Oil or Trinidad Road Binder. This method of construction is being steadily pursued. The total mileage of roadway is 2,337¾, of which 1,758¾ miles of main and local roads are under the control of the Public Works Department, and 579¾ miles of local roads are under the control of Road Boards.

There are numerous motor bus services plying along the Eastern Main Road between Port of Spain and Arima, and along the Southern Main Road between Port of Spain and San Fernando. These services are not continuous, individual owners plying for hire along different sections of the routes. There is also a bus service which links the suburb of Woodbrook to the city.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and 116 out-offices throughout the Colony.

Communication by cable with the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and other parts of the world is maintained by the Pacific Cable Board (All Red Route) and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company. The Pacific Cable Board and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company are both now under the management of Imperial and International Communications Ltd., but both continue to operate separately.

A wireless system of communication is also maintained between the following Islands—Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, Carriacou, St. Lucia, Dominica, Antigua, Montserrat and St. Kitts.

The principal tariffs are:

- To the United Kingdom from Port-of-Spain ... ... 2/4 per word
- To Eastern Canada ... ... 1/6, "
- To Western Canada ... ... 1/8¾, "

There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

Three wireless stations are maintained by the Trinidad Government, namely Port-of-Spain, North Post and Tobago. The North Post Station deals exclusively with ship and Tobago traffic, while communication with British Guiana, St. Martin, Venezuela and Paramaribo is carried out by Port-of-Spain.
Steamers calling at Trinidad comprised the following lines:—Elders and Fyffes, Leyland Line, Harrison Line, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Navigazione Generale Italiana, Trinidad Line (Furness Withy and Coy., Ltd.), Trinidad Line, Western Ocean Steamship Corporation, Prince Line, Ocean Dominion Steamship Corporation, Transatlantica Italiana, Royal Netherlands West India Mail, Canadian National Steamers, Aluminium Line, Orinoco Line, Nourse Line, Hamburg-Amerika Line, Prince Line and the Horne Line. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

In addition an increasing number of steamers call to load oil cargoes, or to take in coal or fuel oil for bunker purposes. During the winter months a number of tourist ships call.

Aerial services were established in the Colony in 1929 by two American Companies, viz.: the Pan American Airways, Incorporated, and the New York, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires Line, and seaplanes now ply from Miami, Florida, via Porto Rico and the Northern Islands to the Colony and thence to South America, a weekly service in either direction being maintained by the companies in question.

In August, 1930, the Pan American Airways Inc., and the New York, Rio and Buenos Aires Line were amalgamated. A weekly air mail service to Venezuela has been established.

The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

- Within Colony .................................. 1d.
- To U.K., India and British Colonies,
  also U.S.A., for 1st oz. ......................... 1d.
  and for each additional oz. or fraction of oz. ... 1½d.
- To other places, for 1st oz. ..................... 3½d.
  and for each additional oz. ...................... 1½d.

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government and in dollars by the public, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1903 an Ordinance providing for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been issued, the total value in circulation at 31st December, 1930, amounting to 122,300£.

Government Savings Banks are established in 35 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1930, was 37,906, with deposits amounting to 470,273£. The savings banks are largely made use of by the East Indians, of whom at the 31st December, 1930, there were 12,651 depositors. The amount deposited by this section of the community during the year is estimated at 70,546£.

The Commercial Banks are (1) Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., with a note circulation in the Colony estimated at 1,500,000£; (2) the Royal Bank of Canada, with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of 1,500,000£; (3) The Canadian Bank of Commerce, with an authorized note circulation of £750,000; (4) Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company, Limited. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce have Savings bank branches and pay the same rate of interest as is paid by the Government Savings Bank, viz. 3 per cent. The Bank of Messrs. Gordon Grant and Co., Limited, is not a bank of issue. In addition to the above Banks there is the Trinidad Co-operative Bank, an institution established in 1914, for the encouragement of thrift.

Education.

At the close of 1930 there were 287 elementary and intermediate schools in the Colony, 43 being Government and 244 assisted schools. There were 251 schools in Trinidad and 36 in Tobago.

The number of pupils on the roll in December, 1930, was 64,167, of whom 35,661 were boys and 28,506 were girls. The average daily attendance was 41,093, or 65·5 per cent. of the number on roll. As compared with the previous year there was an increase of 776 on the roll, or 8 per cent., and of 676 in average attendance or 1·7 per cent. The number of teachers and pupil teachers employed was 1,769 (1,743 in 1929).

The total expenditure on education during the year 1930, deducting the amount received in school and examination fees, was 149,968£. 14s. 3d. as compared with 157,625£. 3s. 7d. in 1929.

Secondary Education.

The following Colleges afford facilities for the higher education of boys:—The Queen’s Royal College and its affiliated institutions, the St. Mary’s College in Port-of-Spain, and the Narapima College in San Fernando, the Bishop’s High School in Tobago. The St. Joseph’s Convent and the St. Hilary’s High School in Port-of-Spain, and the Narapima Girls’ High School at San Fernando, which are also affiliated to the Queen’s Royal College, provide similar education for girls.

The affiliated institutions work under the same curriculum as the Queen’s Royal College, and receive a Government grant-in-aid.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institution for the instruction of the blind.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1588, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I, to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north
side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1634, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the Island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral Estras, to evacuate the island the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefrey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Situation and Area.

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados 120 miles, from Grenada 75 miles, and from Trinidad, 26 miles. It is 26 miles long and 7½ miles at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,213 acres, of which about 41,675 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal line 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The population of Tobago in 1921 was 23,378 according to census.

General Description.

Tobago is a Ward of Trinidad and its exports out of the Colony all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the Colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, live stock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1930 was £127,741l.

The great progress made by Tobago in the last thirty-two years is shown by comparing the value of the chief products for 1897 and 1930:

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1897 | £1,671 |
| 1930 | £70,858 |

Cocoa, Coconuts, Copra and Oil, Live Stock

Miscellaneous items bring the total values to £14,503/- in 1897 and £8,148/- in 1930.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1921, of 773. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of a coastal steamer, provided by the Government.

The island possesses a large mileage of good roads and these are rapidly being extended and improved.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represented Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.

These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the Island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II.

In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it.

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados 120 miles, from Grenada 75 miles, and from Trinidad, 26 miles. It is 26 miles long and 7½ miles at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,213 acres, of which about 41,675 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The population of Tobago in 1921 was 23,378 according to census.

General Description.

Tobago is a Ward of Trinidad and its exports out of the Colony all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the Colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, live stock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1930 was £127,741.

The great progress made by Tobago in the last thirty-two years is shown by comparing the value of the chief products for 1897 and 1930:

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1897 | £1,671 |
| 1930 | £70,858 |

Cacao: £776; Copra and Oil: £28,441; Live Stock: £20,294.

Miscellaneous items bring the total values to £14,503 in 1897 and £8,148 in 1930.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1921, of 773. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of a coastal steamer, provided by the Government.

The island possesses a large mileage of good roads and these are rapidly being extended and improved.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represented Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.
