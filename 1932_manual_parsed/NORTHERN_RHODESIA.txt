NORTHERN RHODESIA.†

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the Territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyassaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 287,950 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine Provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Livingstone, situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls. Other important settlements are at Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Lusaka, Mazabuka, Ndola near which the copper mines of Bwana Mkubwa, Nchanga, Nkana, Roan Antelope, and Mufulira are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, and Mongu-Lealui in Barotseland.

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer, with whose advent the authentic history of Northern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at the Zambesi near the place where the town bearing his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interception on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa, and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey ordered a general advance into German East Africa of the troops under his command, and by July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy. Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbecke doubled southwards, and on the 1st November made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier station, Fife. From there they proceeded southwest to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies.

for the forces operating on the border. The bulk of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the first news of the enemy's advance. After burning most of the buildings and their remaining contents, Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu motor-road, and early on the 13th November his advanced parties opened fire on the British South Africa Company's rubber factory on the Chambeshi River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice was received by the District Commissioner and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted the position and suspended hostilities.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He relinquished office on the 20th September, 1923, and was succeeded by Mr. (now Sir Richard) Goode, C.M.G., C.B.E., as Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika Province of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 25th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924 the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and seven unofficial elected members. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, K.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

He was succeeded in 1927 by Sir James Crawford Maxwell, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., M.D.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen, who function as Native Authorities and Courts. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District officers. The Barotse Province is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied.

District Officers in their capacities as Native Commissioners and Magistrates have a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from Native Commissioners' Courts to Provincial Commissioners as Magistrates, and from Magistrates Courts to the High Court.

Education.

European.—For the education of European children there were in 1931 controlled Schools at Livingstone, Choma, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Broken Hill, Bwana Mukubwa, Ndola, Luanhya, Nkana, and Mufulira offering primary Education up to Standard VII, with the additional subjects Latin, French, Algebra in Standards VI and VII and Geometry in Standard VII. There were Schools at Machili, Tara, Kafue, Silver Rest, Chilongo, Nchanga, Kansanah and Fort Jameson, offering primary education up to Standard V. All these schools were under Government Management. The Convent School, Broken Hill, offering education up to the standard of the Southern Rhodesian Junior Certificate Examination and Chiposa School offering primary education up to Standard V, were controlled schools but under private management.

Boarding accommodation was available for girls at the Beit School, Choma and for boys at the Codrington School, Mazabuka, both under Government management and at the Convent School, Broken Hill and Chiposa School, Fort Jameson, both under private management. There was also open during the year a number of uncontrolled schools with small enrolments and uncertain lives.

Native.—The Department of Native Education supervises the educational work of the Missionary Societies working in the Territory, and apportions the grants in aid of the Mission Schools which conform to the Government syllabus and requirements. There is an Advisory Board on Native Education upon which Missions, Settlers and Government Departments are represented. A Government School for the training of "Jeanes" Teachers and Agricultural Demonstrators was opened at Mazabuka in
1930, connected with the Central Research Station. The Barotse National School is also a Government Institution. An elementary school was opened at Ndola during 1931, and it is proposed shortly to open other Government schools at Fort Jameson, Broken Hill, and Kasama.

Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° to 90° with a maximum of 103° and a minimum of 58°. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 55° to 76° with a maximum of 86° and a minimum of 40°. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of 120°, whilst minima round about 30° are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period May to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70% to 90% of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again. The average rainfall so far as present investigations shew is 34.18 inches per annum.

Commerce and Industry.

Agriculture.

The cattle and ranching industries are gradually attaining a more satisfactory position owing to increased fencing and better cattle-management amongst European-owned stock and to the dipping which has been commenced amongst Native-owned stock in the Reserves.

The consumption in the local mining areas, together with the demands in the mining areas of the Belgian Congo, are so great that the whole of the markets cannot be supplied from the cattle of the Territory. The stocks available are now nearly sufficient to supply the local markets, but those in the Belgian Congo are still supplied to a great extent from Southern Rhodesia and Ngamiland.

The cattle of the Territory are singularly free from major diseases and the mortality is not high upon those farms or ranches where good cattle-mastership is practised.

The dairy industry is small and is not making the progress which the demands of the local markets require. The principal creamery of the Territory has been closed down, and, at the moment, a small local creamery at Lusaka is the only one available. As a result, practically the whole of the butter consumed in the Territory is imported. There can be no doubt of the scope for increased effort in the production of dairy produce.

By far the greater portion of the Territory may be said to be undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in the matter of its food supply, practically the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little or no general trade in food commodities other than in a purely local sense. The staple native cereals are finger-millet (Eleusine coracana), Kaffir-corn (Sorghum), and Maize. The former is produced over huge tracts of the Territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby one grain crop is grown in rotation with forest re-growths which may occupy the land for from fifteen years to upwards of sixty years or more in the less favoured places. In this system, the gardens revert to bush after each grain crop. Other native crops are bulrush millet (Pennisetum typhoideum), ground-nuts, cassava, sweet-potatoes, and great variety of pumpkins, gourds, and beans. Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but on a small scale for private consumption and a small localized trade only. Considerable numbers of cattle are owned by natives in the Territory but these are mainly confined to certain tribes, notably the Marosi, Bells, Matoka, and, to a less extent, the Angoni in North-eastern Rhodesia.

Many parts of the Territory are impassable to animal transports owing to the presence of tse-tse fly. In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management.

Maize is the chief crop and the demand for this from the mines is steadily increasing. The acreage was increased by 8,900 acres during the season 1929-30 but, owing to the unfavourable season, the total yield showed no material increase on the previous year. The increasing use of tractors in certain districts is having an important bearing on the total yield and where these up-to-date methods, combined with adequate green manuring, are practised the results are most encouraging. Increased competition from the south, evidenced by offers of grain at low prices, has not been without its effect on the local market and prices have tended to decrease during the last few years. During 1931, however, a three years contract with certain of the mining companies was made.

The cultivation of cotton is still confined to experimental work at the Central Research Station and on selected farms. Jassid resistant varieties have been obtained but attacks by other insects such as Stainer and Bollworm makes it impossible, as yet, to state whether this crop is likely to occupy any position amongst the export crops of the Territory. Its value, however, as a rotation crop for maize makes it essential that every avenue should be explored to obtain a variety suitable to local conditions.

The position as regards tobacco is still one of some difficulty. The leaf which can be produced in the Territory has been proved to be of good quality and acceptable to the limited market in the United Kingdom. Extensive increase in the acreage planted to tobacco depends almost entirely on the absorption of leaf in the home markets and there is little evidence yet to show that this is likely to be largely increased in the near future. Every effort is being made to consolidate the position of Northern Rhodesia leaf on the markets by exporting only that leaf which is of good quality.

Most of the wheat produced in the Territory is handled by the Co-operative Society at Lusaka. A trade has sprung up for good Boermeal and practically the whole of the crop is now offered in this form. Considerable extension in wheat production would appear to depend upon adequate grinding and grading facilities which are essential for putting upon the market a flour which can compete with present-day well-established brands.

The Central Research Station, which is situated about three miles from Mazabuka on the railway line in the centre of the farming areas, was opened on the 2nd November, 1929. This station, which is a joint Agricultural and Veterinary one, is staffed and equipped to deal with general agricultural investigations of local economic importance on the one hand, and on the other, with specific researches designed to lead to the control of animal diseases of economic
importance in the Territory. Joint investigations, having as their object the improvement of the general standard of animal husbandry in the Territory, are also proceeding.

Two agricultural sub-stations are in process of formation, one at Fort Jameson and the other at Abercorn. These sub-stations, which will be under the supervision of the District Agricultural Officers now stationed at these points, in addition to the conduct of investigations of purely local significance in their respective districts, will undertake the testing out of local application of results obtained in the more detailed investigations carried out at the Central Station and will constitute centres for the dissemination of agricultural information and instruction in the areas which they serve. It may confidently be expected that the combined work of these Stations will be of considerable aid to agriculture generally in the Territory in which, hitherto, no facilities have existed for accurate investigation of any of the many problems which confront the local agriculturist.

The Jeanes School at Mazabuka, in the vicinity of the Central Research Station, provides agricultural training for selected natives who will subsequently be employed, under technical direction, as agricultural demonstrators in the native areas.

Forestry.

More than 60 per cent. of the entire area of Northern Rhodesia is estimated to be more or less covered with trees and shrubs, but the forest growth, chiefly of the Savannah Woodland type, is undergoing considerable modification in composition and area as a result of native shifting cultivation and annual fires. A Forestry Branch has been instituted in recent years and three forestry officers are now carrying out investigations in various parts of the Territory. Reafforestation and protective measures have already been commenced in one forest. It is proposed to maintain certain areas as protection forests for the prevention of soil erosion and the preservation of water supplies in springs and rivers. Further areas are to be dedicated to the production of timber of the more useful indigenous species. The aerial survey at present being carried out over part of the Territory will greatly accelerate the demarcation of Forest Reserves in that region. Experimental plantations of fast growing exotic tree species are being established and private enterprise in this direction has already commenced in the mining areas.

The only commercial timber industry in the Territory at present is that of the Zambesi Saw Mills Ltd., whose operations extend from Livingstone to the Machili River under concessions granted by the Government. This Company is chiefly concerned with the extraction, by light railway, of timbers of the Kalahari sand belt type, including Mkushi, Baikiaea plurijuga; Mukwa, Pterocarpus angolensis; Mwangu, Pterocarpus stenocarpus; Mupumena, Entandrophragma sp.; Mkamba, Azelia quanzenis; Mugongo Ricinodendron rauanensis; and Musheshe, Burkea africana. The Company has contracts for supplying sleepers to the South African and Rhodesian Railways.

Land Settlement.

An Agricultural Survey Committee has been appointed for the purpose of reporting upon the unalienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European settlement, and this Committee will advise as to the class of farming or ranching for which the land is suitable. Pending the report of this Committee the Government is not embarking on any extensive programme of land settlement. Privately owned land, however, suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 15s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least 2,000/- capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

Department of Mines.

The outstanding mining developments of the year 1930 were:

(a) Great improvement in economy and output of zinc of the Broken Hill Mine and the completion of preparations for vanadium recovery.

(b) Excellent strides in the development and equipment of the Roan Antelope Mine towards production. By the end of the year the 5,000 tons a day plant was within six months of completion and underground development became intense; all this work was carried out in an exceptionally safe manner.

(c) Progress was good in the development particularly of the Nkana Mine but also of the Mufulira Mine and of Nchanga West.

(d) Kansanshi Mine development for the actual working of the mine commenced during the year.

(e) Vigorous geological and topographical survey was being carried out by the Rhodesia Congo Border Concession, the Loangwa Concession Ltd., Rhodesia Minerals Concession, and the Kafue Copper Development Company.

(f) In the North Charterland Concession the Mining Trust ceased operations at the end of the year. During 1930 7,510 ozs. of gold, 637 ozs. of silver, 6,269 tons of copper, 8,954 lbs. of mica, 122,577 lbs. of vanadium, 872 tons of manganese ore, 9 tons of iron ore, and 20,053 tons of zinc were produced.

Means of Communication.

The Railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambezi is crossed by a single span bridge, 850 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have now been constructed from Ndola to Luanshya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nchanga via Nkana, a distance of 84 miles. Another line runs from Mokambo, in the Belgian Congo, to Mufulira, nine miles distant.

Consideration is being given by a private company to the construction of a short connecting link, which has already been surveyed between Kansanshi Mine and the Katanga Railway which will bring that mine into more direct communication with the port of Lobito and, it is estimated, will save about 14 days in shipment of freights to and from Europe.

A survey is also being made of a direct connection to Kansanshi from the Benguela Railway at a point in Portuguese West Africa.

Road communications are being opened up, and dry season motor tracks are now in use from Victoria Falls (via Livingstone, Lusaka and Broken Hill) to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge (790 miles approx.) ; Broken Hill to Abercorn (604 miles), and thence via Mwenzu, on the border of Northern Rhodesia, to Tanganyika and Kenya Colony; this portion forming part of the Cape to Cairo Route. Lusaka and Fort Jameson are also connected by road, a distance of 375 miles, and a road, leaving the Great North Road...
about 45 miles north of Broken Hill, runs through the Mining Areas via Ndola, Nchanga, Solwezi, Kasempa, and Mumbwa to rejoin the Great North Road at Chisamba.

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambeshi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aerodromes, equipped with re-fuelling masts, and suitable for large aircraft are situated at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Ndola, and Mpika. Aerodromes suitable for small aircraft exist at Mazabuka, Solwezi, Kasempa, Fort Jameson, Mongu, Abercorn, and at each of the large copper mines. Emergency landing grounds are available at Isoka, Chinsali, Serenje, and Mtuga.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyassaland. There are 45 post offices in the Territory, 18 of which are money order offices. There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and other lines link up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyassaland, Tanganyika Territory, and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the Territory is 2,499 miles.

NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.†

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shire Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chiwla and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shire) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shire Highlands and Mlanje.

It is bounded on the north by Tanganyika Territory, on the west by Northern Rhodesia, on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and according to the most recent survey has a total area of about 47,949 square miles (land, 37,956).

It is divided into two Provinces, each under the control of a Provincial Commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into twenty districts, each in charge of a district commissioner, who is also a district magistrate.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shire Highlands, where there are about 700 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

Population (31st December, 1930).
Europeans, 1,905; Asiatics, 1,599; Natives, 1,392,742.

History.

In 1869 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (later Sir H. H. Johnston, G.C.M.G., K.C.B.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaos round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shiré districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wabenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (later Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasaland was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shiré and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanj and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaos at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. In 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

Constitution.

The administration of the Protectorate, control of which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Nairobi.

Climate and Products.

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shire Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shiré Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shiré Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

Industry and Customs.

The chief products of the Protectorate are tobacco, cotton, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat, and fibre.

The export of cotton for the year ended 31st December, 1930, was 3,798,338 lbs.; of tobacco 14,073,247 lbs. 99.2 per cent. of the export trade in 1930 was to the United Kingdom and British Colonies.

The chief imports are provisions, cotton goods, motor vehicles, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition. 55 per cent. of the imports in 1930 came from the United Kingdom and British Colonies.

The Customs revenue is derived principally from an import duty of 17% on the cost at the seaport of discharge, i.e., Beira. No export duties are levied.

Nyasaland being wholly within the regions covered by the Congo Basin Treaties, 1885, and the Convention of St. Germain-en-Laye, 1919, may not grant preferential rates of duty. Its Customs Tariff, therefore, applies equally to imports from all nations.

Customs revenue collected during 1930 amounted to £148,531. as against £141,229. in the previous year.
The following table shows the origin of direct consignments of domestic trade imports during the last five years:

| Year | United Kingdom | British Possessions | Foreign Countries |

| 1930 | 253,957 | 34.79 | 147,042 | 19.83 | 337,773 | 45.38 |

The total exports of the Protectorate during 1930 weighed 12,436 tons and were valued at 691,908£. Of the domestic products exported 97.29 per cent. of the weight and 99.2 per cent. of the value were consigned to the United Kingdom.

Means of Communication.

A railway from Port Herald, on the Lower Shire, to Blantyre, 113 miles, via Chiromo and Luchenza, was built by the Shiré Highlands Railway, under an agreement made in 1902 with the Nyasaland Government under which a subsidy was paid to the Railway. Subsequently the Central African Railway Co., Ltd., constructed a section, opened in 1915, from Chindio on the Zambesi to Port Herald, 61 miles, of which the first 45 are on Portuguese territory. Both lines are of 3ft. 6in. gauge. A railway of the same gauge was opened for traffic in April, 1922, by the Trans-Zambezia Railway Co., Ltd., which runs from Murraça on the south bank of the Zambesia to Dondo, the junction with the Mashonaland trunk line, about 20 miles from Beira (165 miles, all in Portuguese territory). A bridge across the Zambesi to connect the Trans-Zambezia Railway with the Central Africa Railway is now under construction, as is also an extension of the railway system from Blantyre to Lake Nyasa. There are eight British steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shiré between Chinde and the railway terminus. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being 3,418. There are eight steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Mails to and from England are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

The total mileage through the Protectorate is 787 miles. Telegrams may also be transmitted over the railway line and the Portuguese line between Chinde and Tete. Since Government assumed control of the telegraph service extensions have been constructed in the Central Province providing 140 additional miles of line. The telephone service now links up Zomba, Blantyre, Limbe, Cholo, and Luchenza.

Education.

An educational policy has been prepared by the Director of Education. Provision is made for the education of European children; native education in the hands of the missionary societies is controlled by the Government.
