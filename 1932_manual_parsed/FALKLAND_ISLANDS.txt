FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N. E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Monte Video. They consist of East Falkland Island and West Falkland Island, which, with the adjacent islands, have an estimated area of 2,580 square miles and 2,038 square miles respectively.

There are two groups of dependencies (i) South Georgia with South Orkney and South Sandwich, the boundaries being the 50th parallel of south latitude and the 20th and 50th meridians of west longitude (ii) South Shetland and Graham Land bounded by the parallel of latitude 58° S., and the meridians of longitude 50° and 80° W. The territory of both the dependencies extends to the South Pole.

This area contains about 3,100,000 square miles or 1½% of the entire surface of the globe, and one-fifth approximately of the total area of the British Empire. Much of it is ice-bound, but there are more than a million square miles of sea readily accessible for whaling, fishing and sealing.

The island of South Georgia lies about 300 miles to the east of the Falkland Islands, South Orkney and South Sandwich being about 450 miles to the south-west and south-east respectively of South Georgia. The northern point of South Shetland is about 500 miles to the south of the Falklands.

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1764 they were taken possession of by France and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis in East Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1766.

In the following year Captain Byron took possession of West Falkland, and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770; this action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the island in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774 and no further formal occupation was made until 1820, when the Republic of Buenos Aires established a settlement which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 occupation of the islands was resumed by the British Government for the protection of the whale fishery. Until 1842, they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making Admiralty surveys. In 1842, a Civil Administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis until the following year when they were removed to Stanley, then known as Port William.

The colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 until 1880 and for a mail service until 1884-5, since which year the colony has been self-supporting.

South Georgia and the South Sandwich group were discovered in 1775 by Captain James Cook, who took possession of them for Britain. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain William Smith in 1819, and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821.

The dependencies were visited only by exploring expeditions, sealers, and whalers until the rise of the modern whaling industry in those regions.

General Description

(a) Falkland Islands.

The Falkland Islands have a very deeply indented coast line and many good natural harbours. The surface is hilly, attaining its maximum elevation of 2,315 feet in Mount Adam, West Falkland.

The entire country is covered with wild moorland interrupted by outcrops of rock and the peculiar collections of angular boulders named "stone runs."

There is no cultivation except in the immediate vicinity of the settlements and shepherds' houses where vegetables and in a few places hay is grown. The soil is chiefly peat but considerable areas of sand also occur.

Communication is maintained by sea and horses, but there are no roads beyond the immediate vicinity of Stanley, the traveller being guided by natural landmarks. A commencement has been recently made to indicate recognized tracks with direction posts. Trees are completely absent.

The only town is Stanley in East Falkland, with a population of about 1,200. The houses are mostly iron and wood, built as they are required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house but there are several boarding houses affording fair accommodation. Stanley is a port of register and had, on the 31st December, 1930, 34 vessels aggregating 39,603 tons.

The cost of mutton is 3d. per lb., of beef 5d., fowls' eggs when procurable cost 2½d. to 3d. each, while penguin eggs in spring are sold at a price varying from 4s. to 8s. 6d. per hundred. Milk is priced at 1s. per quart. Most foodstuffs have to be imported.

Climate and Health.

In the Falklands the temperature is uniformly low, ranging from 40° to 65° in summer and from 30° to 50° in winter, with an annual mean of 42°.

The annual rainfall seldom exceeds 25 inches, and although snow falls frequently it does not as a rule lie long. In summer the atmosphere is very dry and evaporation rapid.

The climate is rendered trying to people from the United Kingdom on account of the continuous cold and lack of sun and the constant high winds as well as the few opportunities afforded for outdoor exercise. The conditions of living are generally comparable with those obtaining in small towns in the north of Scotland, except that by natural situation the Colony is very isolated and its resources and horizons very limited. A difficulty is experienced in providing any variety of diet and in particular fresh meat other than mutton, and fresh fruit and vegetables are at most times difficult to obtain. The birth rate in 1930 was 22·73 per 1,000 and the death rate 8·42.

(b) Dependencies.

The island of South Georgia is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, while the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea. There is a coastal fringe free from snow in summer and more or less clothed with vegetation, including tussock "grass." Land whaling stations have been established in five of the numerous bays.

The remaining dependencies are even more inhospitable, being nearly completely covered.

* The construction of the first road beyond the town boundary was commenced in 1929.
with snow and ice and almost entirely destitute of plant life. All the dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

A land whaling station is operated during the summer months at Deception Island in the South Shetland group.

Another station has been built in the South Orkneys but has not been in actual operation in recent years.

**Industries, Trade and Customs.**

The inhabitants of the Falkland Islands are almost entirely occupied in sheep farming, the whole acreage of the colony being divided into large sheep runs. Wool is the principal product but tallow and hides are also exported. There were in 1930 606,882 sheep, 9,445 cattle and 3,546 horses in the islands.

Seal oil is also produced for export by a company formed in 1928.

The whaling field of the dependencies, in which whaling by modern methods was first carried on in 1904, has become more productive than all those in the rest of the world combined; a small quantity of seal oil is also produced.

An expedition for research, mainly into whaling, for which the ships "Discovery II" and "William Scoresby" have been acquired, has been operating in the southern seas.

In the case of the Colony proper, the export trade was almost exclusively with the United Kingdom; in the case of the Dependencies no exact figures are available, but the whale and seal oil exported went principally to Scandinavia, Holland and Germany, although the consumption in the United Kingdom was not inconsiderable.

In the case of the Colony proper, 82% of the imports came from the United Kingdom, 7% from Uruguay and 5% from Chile; in the case of the Dependencies no exact figures are available, but the bulk of the coal imported was from the United Kingdom; machinery, equipment and provisions for the whaling expeditions being brought mainly from Norway.

The Customs duties are all specific and non-preferential. Import duties are levied on wines, spirits, beer and matches, and export duties on wool, guano, whale oil and seal oil.

**Education.**

There are two schools in Stanley. A Government school is maintained from public funds, which, whilst being elementary in character, makes provision for attendance at a Continuation Class for a two years' course of further education. There is also a Convent School managed by Roman Catholic Sisters; this school, however, is not subject to Government control, and receives no subsidy.

The Government contributes two-thirds of the cost of the board and lodging of children from the country districts attending school in Stanley.

Four travelling teachers are provided by the Government and three by the Falkland Islands Company. These teachers travel from Settlement to Settlement devoting a certain amount of time to each. The number of children receiving education in the Colony in 1930 was 381.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and local 5s., 1s., and 10s. notes. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established, in which, on 30th September, 1930, the deposits were 142,189l., belonging to 933 depositors.

**The Falkland Islands Company, Limited.**

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This, however, was not found profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, in shipping, and in the importation of goods.

The company maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin, and contributes to the provision of a salary for a clergyman of the Church of England.

**Means of Communication.**

The vessels of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company call at Stanley on their voyage round South America on an average six times a year in either direction. In order to supplement this service and with a view to ensuring mail communication with the United Kingdom at intervals of not more than a month the Government has recently made arrangements for local vessels to make voyages as required to and from Monte Video, where the mails are transhipped to Europe. Few passenger steamers call at Stanley but passages can, as a rule, be obtained either by cargo vessels direct to England or via Monte Video, whence the voyage can be continued by passenger liner. Inter-isular communication, at approximately monthly intervals, is maintained by the coasting steamer belonging to the Falkland Islands Company, Limited, and by special sailings arranged by the Government. Communication with the Dependencies is maintained by the Tonsberg Whaling Company, under contract with the Government.

The rates of postage are as follows:—

**Letters.**

To the United Kingdom, British Possessions, Egypt, and to places within the Colony : 1d. per oz. or fraction of an oz.

To other countries: 2½d. per oz. and 1¼d. for every additional oz. or fraction of an oz.

**Parcels.**

Two wireless stations for external traffic are maintained by the Government, one at Stanley and one at Cumberland Bay, Grytviken, in the Dependency of South Georgia. A smaller station at Fox Bay on the West Falkland is maintained also by the Government for inter-isular communication. The traffic is transmitted and received principally through Bergen and Monte Video. Telegraphic charges are 1s. a word to the United Kingdom via Bergen, and 1s. 1d. a word to Monte Video. The installation of direct communication on short-wave with the United Kingdom is at present under consideration. The principal farm stations on East Falkland Island are connected by telephone with the Stanley exchange and those on West Falkland Island with the Government headquarters at Fox Bay.
Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council composed of three official members and one unofficial member, and a Legislative Council composed of four official and two unofficial members. The unofficial members of the Legislative Council are appointed by Warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet for a term not exceeding five years.
