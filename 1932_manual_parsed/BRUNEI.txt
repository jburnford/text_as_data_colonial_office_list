BRUNEI.

His Highness Ahmed Tajudin, Sultan.

Brunei is a State lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 114° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. It is 770 nautical miles distant from Singapore.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the district of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 2,500 square miles, containing a population of about 30,000, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Tutong, Belait, and Temburong.

In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government. Whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, a further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915 a separate resident was appointed for Brunei and the appointment of Assistant Resident discontinued.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000.

Besides the old Malay town which is built over the water on the Brunei River there is a new township on the mainland which has steadily developed since 1910. There are vernacular schools at Brunei and in the out-districts. The climate resembles that of the Federated Malay States. The average annual rainfall at Brunei is a little over 100 inches.

Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 2,600 in the State. Native industries include fishing, cloth weaving, brass foundries, and the manufacture of silversmiths' ware. The principal imports are rice, cloth, tobacco, sugar, and petroleum, and the principal exports, cutch (mangrove extract), wild and plantation rubber, sago, and dried prawns. The trade, to which an impetus was given by the inauguration of the new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

In 1924 the British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited commenced prospecting and drilling operations for petroleum in the Belait District. In 1930 it became definitely established that an oil-field of considerable commercial value had been found at Seria, 10 miles North-west of Kuala Belait. The Company is now developing and testing this field for production and the export of oil by small tank steamers has already begun.

Several companies are engaged in planting Para rubber.

A cutch factory, established by a London syndicate, is at work at Brunei. The output of cutch in 1930 was 2,994 tons, valued at $220,080.

There are two native industries of importance, the manufacture of brassware and silverware, and these are more or less restricted to certain families or guilds. Weaving is done by Brunei women, and the natives are excellent fishermen.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from the land and mining rents, from an opium monopoly under Government control, from the collection of customs duties, and from purchased Cession moneys. About half of the original Cession moneys have now been purchased by the Government.

The Public Debt on the 31st December, 1930, was $401,000.

Communications.

There is regular communication with Labuan by steam launch and so with Singapore by the Straits
Steamship Company, which maintains a weekly service.

A Central Wireless Telegraph Station was opened in 1921 at Brunei with a subsidiary station at Labuan which enables telegraphic communication to be maintained with Labuan and thence by cable with Singapore and Europe. There are other Wireless Stations in the Belait and Temburong Districts.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.

†TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Tanganyika Territory consists of that portion of the former Colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I., of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the Colony, namely the districts of Ruanda and Urundi in the North-West, and the Klongo Area, South of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. The Territory extends from the Umba River on the North to the Rovuma River on the South, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands. The Northern Boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of latitude with the eastern shore of the lake (Mohuru Point), and thence along the first parallel of latitude until it strikes the Kagera River about 70 miles west of Lake Victoria. From this point the western boundary follows the Kagera River to approximately latitude 2°25', and thence along the eastern boundary of Urundi to the Migamasi River which it follows to Lake Tanganyika. The boundary then follows a line due west until it reaches the centre line of Lake Tanganyika which it follows to Kasanga (formerly Bismarckburg), at the southern end of the lake. Thence it follows the boundary of Rhodesia to the northern end of Lake Nyasa and continues along the centre line of Lake Nyasa to a point due west of the Rovuma River whence the boundary runs east and joins the Rovuma River, whose course it follows to the sea. The total area of the Territory is about 374,085 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of water.

The Island of Mafia was transferred in 1922 from Zanzibar to the Territory.

General Description.

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,590 feet; Nyasa, 1,607 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 35,000) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which has a population of 25,000, and is situated at the junction of the main caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa, and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway; Ujiji, on Tanganyika; and Mwaya, on Nyasa.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilima Njaro, which rises to 19,720 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,960 feet). In the south-west are the Livingstone Mountains, where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz.: the southern portion of Lake Victoria, the eastern shores of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika, and the northern and north-eastern shores of Lake Nyasa. There are smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

Climate.

The climate of the Territory varies greatly according to the height above sea-level of the several districts. Roughly, four climatic zones can be distinguished, though even among these there are considerable local variations:—(i) The warm and rather damp coast region with its adjoining hinterland.—Here, conditions are tropical, though not unpleasant except just before and during the rainy seasons, when the heat is trying and the atmosphere humid. The average yearly temperature is 78 degrees. (ii) The hot and moderately dry zone between the coast and the central plateau (300 feet—2,000 feet). This zone is characterised by low humidity of atmosphere, less rain, and a temperature rather lower but with greater daily and yearly variations. (iii) The hot and dry zone of the central plateau between 2,000 feet and 4,000 feet in height.—The climate of this zone differs greatly in parts, but its prevailing characteristics are low humidity, little rainfall (at Tabora an annual average of 32 inches), a fairly high mean temperature, with great daily and yearly variations, sometimes exceeding 36 degrees Fahrenheit daily. The heat is dry, but not so trying to the European as the moist and steamy warmth of the coast, while the nights are invariably cold. (iv) The semi-temperate regions around the slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru, of the Usambara Highlands, the Ulipa Plateau, and the mountainous areas of the south-western area (5,000 feet—10,000 feet).—Frosts occur at the higher altitudes, and the nights are cold. These districts enjoy a bracing climate, and alone can be considered healthy for Europeans, but prolonged residence in these altitudes is apt to produce nervous strain, even though physical fitness is maintained. There are two well-defined rainy seasons annually. Generally speaking, the long rains begin in February or March, and last...
for two or three months, while the short rainy season extends from October to November, but the rainfall is low for a tropical country, and droughts are not infrequent.

History.

Plentiful evidence exists of Arab traders having visited the Territory for several centuries and of their opening up the great slave route from Bagamoyo on the Indian Ocean to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. The British explorer, Burton, first entered the Territory in 1856, and was soon followed by Speke, Livingstone, and Stanley.

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made twelve treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilima Njaro and occupied Moshi on March 13th of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's Forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on January 1st, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in 1919 appointing an Administrator, The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on September 25th, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council. In 1921 the district of Ujiji and portions of the districts of Bukoba and Ufipa, which had formerly been administered by the Belgians, were taken over.

In 1920 draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium, and these were approved by the League of Nations in 1922. The mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain lays down conditions directed against slavery, forced labour (except for essential public works and services), abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It is provided that nationals of States members of the League of Nations are to have complete commercial equality. An annual report is to be made to the Council of the League. By an Order in Council dated the 19th of March, 1926, provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, thirteen official members, and not more than ten unofficial members, which came into operation on the 1st July, 1926.

Population.

The number of Europeans in Tanganyika Territory is approximately 6,900. There are also over 18,000 Indians, 4,000 Arabs, and 1,000 Goans. The natives are estimated at 4,852,244. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Masai and other Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important language is Swahili, which is a hybrid between Arabic and Persian and all sorts of African tongues. It is more or less spoken as a lingua franca from Aden in the north to Durban in the south, and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but the majority of the coastal tribes and a few in the hinterland profess Mohammedanism.

The territory is divided into 11 Provinces as follows:

| Provinces | Capital   | Approx. Native Population, 1930 |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Central   | Dodoma    | 635,957                        |

| Totals    |           | 4,852,244                      |

Education.

During 1930 there were 3,044 Mission schools devoted to African education with an average attendance of 97,745 pupils. There were also 94 Government schools with 5,606 children in average attendance. The amount allocated to education in 1931/32 is £24,893. Two schools are maintained by Government for the education of European children, one a day school at Dar-es-Salaam and the other a small boarding school at Engare Nairobi in the Northern Province. Assistance is given to three Dutch schools in the Arusha District, to two Roman Catholic schools in Dar-es-Salaam and Tabora, to a German school in the Tanga Province, and to a private kindergarten at Dodoma. There are a number of other schools as yet unassisted from public funds in various parts of the Territory. 36 Indian schools are in existence with a total enrolment of 2,300 pupils. All these are now in receipt of financial assistance. Government publishes a monthly journal printed in Swahili to disseminate news and useful information among the vernacular speaking population.

Forests and Minerals.

The total area under close forests is approximately 4,117 square miles, of which 96·8 per cent. is in Government Forest Reserves, 1·5 per cent. awaits reservation, and 1·7 per cent is valuable forest in private ownership. The forests are most numerous in the north, on the shores and islands of Lake Victoria, in the North-east on Kilimanjaro and Meru Mountains; in the East along the Pare and Usambara ranges and in the Uluguru and Nguu Mountains; and at the coast, in the districts of Rufiji, Kilwa, and Lindi. Further considerable areas of close forest are situated in the highlands of Iringa Province, most of which have now been explored and demarcated for reservation, while others, including such forests as Ukwama, Kisanga and Nyumbanito, totalling over 150 square miles, have been gazetted as Forest Reserves. The number of timber-producing species is large and includes among many others the following:—Pencil Cedar (Juniperus procera), Podocarpus, Chlorophora
Excelia (resembling Burma Teak), Ooteca Usambarensis, Pterocarpus Russei, Parinarium Holstii, Pygeum africanum, Afzelia quanzensis, Khaya Senegalensis and Cassipourea Eikii. In addition, valuable species of hardwoods occur as single trees or in groups widely scattered throughout large areas of dry savannah forest. Mangroves of excellent quality cover large areas of the littoral. Ebony and gum copal are plentiful near the coast. Bamboo and baobab are found and may prove suitable for the manufacture of paper pulp.

The following have been mined for export or local use:—Gold, diamonds, mica, salt, tin, and red ochre. Other minerals known to exist include:—Coal, copper, iron, graphite, asbestos, and soda. Extensive areas remain to be prospected. The total mineral production for 1930 was valued at £125,395.

Further information with regard to trade and cognate matters in Tanganyika Territory can be obtained from the Chairman, Tanganyika Trade and Information Local Advisory Committee, c/o The Comptroller of Customs, Dar-es-Salaam.

Communications.

The Territory is served by two railways of metre gauge.

1. The Central Railway from Dar-es-Salaam to Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika (772½ miles), with a branch line from Tabora (622 miles) to Mwanza (236 miles) on Lake Victoria.

2. The Tanga or Northern Railway from Tanga via Moshi (219 miles) to Arusha (272 miles). The extension Moshi to Arusha was completed in May, 1930. From Kahe Junction (206 miles) a line links up with the Kenya and Uganda Railway at Voi. The Voi-Kahe line is run under the management of the Kenya and Uganda Railway.

The two feet gauge line in the Lindi District was closed down in March, 1930.

Light motor traffic is now possible over 12,740 miles of roads during the dry season.

The ports of Lake Victoria are served by the steamers of the Kenya and Uganda Marine; those of Lake Nyasa by the Nyasaland Government steamers, and the Tanganyika Railways steamship "Liembe" and a smaller one "Mwanza," together with a Belgian service, maintains communications on Lake Tanganyika. The British steamer "Liembe" (late German s.s. "Goetzen," 796 and 427 tons gross and net respectively) was put into commission on June 9th, 1927, and maintains a fortnightly service to Mpulungu, in Northern Rhodesia, via Albertville and Southern Lake Ports.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The telegraph system comprises 3,579 route miles with 7,176½ miles of wire, and the number of offices, including railway telegraph offices, open for public business is 141. The principal offices are Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Lindi on the coast, Bukoba and Mwanza on Lake Victoria, Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika, Kilosa, Dodoma and Tabora on the Central Railway Line, Moshi on the Kenya Border and Tukuyu on the Nyassaland Border.

The inland telegraph system forms a link of land line communication between Kenya and Uganda to the north, and Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and the rest of South Africa to the south, while communication is established with the Belgian Congo through a wireless station at Kigoma.

Dar-es-Salaam is connected by cable with Zanzibar, through which is established communication with all parts of the world.

Trunk Telephone communication is provided on some of the important routes by utilizing the telegraph wires when required, while between Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam the telegraph is superimposed on a permanent trunk, with an extension to Mombasa.

Thirty eight Telephone Exchange centres are established, comprising 227½ route miles with 1,091½ miles of wire.

Letter mails from Great Britain are despatched from London weekly via Marseilles, whence they are conveyed direct by vessels of the Messageries Maritimes, and by the P. & O. line via Aden, the average time in transit being 22 days. Letter mails to Great Britain are despatched from Dar-es-Salaam by all available steamers.

Parcel mails are despatched weekly by steamers of the P. & O. line from London by the all-sea route to Aden, whence they are conveyed by any steamer proceeding to Mombasa or beyond. The Aden-Mombasa-Dar-es-Salaam service is irregular, and the average time of transit of parcel mails from London to Dar-es-Salaam is 30 days.

Fortnightly mail services are maintained with India and South Africa, and there is a frequent exchange of mails by sea with Kenya Colony and Zanzibar.

Places on the Central Railway line between Dar-es-Salaam and Tabora exchange mails three times weekly, between Tabora and Kigoma twice weekly, on the Mwanza line between Tabora and Mwanza twice weekly, on the Tanga-Moshi-Arusha line between Tanga and Korogwe daily, between Korogwe and Buiko five times weekly and between Buiko and Arusha twice weekly. Outlying districts served by motor or runner have a mail service weekly, and in a few cases more frequently.

* In 1927-28 only the net Railway Revenue was included in the Territory's Revenue. Previous years include the gross Railway Revenue. In 1928-29 and subsequent years the Railway Revenue is excluded entirely.
Currency and Banking.

The German Government and the German East Africa Company issued local rupees of the Indian Standard, and subsidiary coins. But the German rupee was exchanged for two shillings of East African Currency and withdrawn from circulation. Indian Rupees (coins and notes) have been demonetised. Shillings and subsidiary coins, and currency notes of the East African Currency Board have been introduced at the rate of twenty shillings to the pound sterling and this is the only currency now recognised.

The Banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Barclay's Bank (Dominion, Colonial, and Overseas), and the Banque du Congo Belge.

Trade and Customs.

Since 1923 the Customs Tariff of the Territory has been identical with that in force in Kenya and Uganda and provision was made for the duty-free interchange of all goods grown, produced or manufactured in any one of the three territories. In 1927 the Customs management laws of the three territories were coordinated, and on the 1st August, 1927, effect was given to an Agreement under which all goods on which duty had been collected in one of the territories may be transferred to any of the other territories without further formality except the preparation of simple transfer forms, on which inter-territorial adjustments of revenue are subsequently arranged.

The tariff was revised in 1930, being enacted simultaneously in Tanganyika, Kenya, and Uganda. The basic fiscal rate is 20 per cent. ad valorem, assessed on the current domestic value of the goods in the exporting country together with the cost of packing, delivery on board, freight, insurance and all other charges up to the time of importation into the Territory. On certain goods which permit of such an imposition duty is charged at specific rates corresponding generally to an equivalent ad valorem rate of 20 per cent. On liqueurs and similar spirits the duty is 40 shillings per Imperial gallon, while whisky, brandy, gin and rum are charged with duty at 40 shillings per proof gallon ascertained by Syke's hydrometer. Manufactured tobacco is liable to 62½ per cent. ad valorem, with a minimum of 5 shillings per pound on cigars, and 2/40 per pound on cigarettes and tobacco. In the case of certain specific commodities such as sugar, timber, wheat flour, bacon and ham, butter, cheese and ghee, which can be produced locally in sufficient quantity to meet the demands of the three territories, provision is made, in the form of additional "suspended" duties, for a modified degree of protection. A reduced rate of 10 per cent. ad valorem is payable on building materials, metals, tools, printing materials, lubricants, paints, sporting goods, children's toys, and infants' foods, while the free list includes machinery, packing materials, ships and boats, aircraft, motor and steam lorries and tractors, materials and equipment for the construction and maintenance of telegraph and telephone lines and of railways, tramways and roads; medicines, disinfectants and insecticides; coal, coke and oil fuel; fertilisers; blasting compounds; filters and refrigerators; surgical and scientific instruments, and all used personal and household effects imported as passengers' baggage.

The values in pounds sterling of the import and export trade of the Territory, the total Customs receipts, and the tonnage of vessels entered at Tanganyika ocean ports, are given below. The import figures are exclusive of Government imports, transit traffic, and bullion and specie, while transit exports are similarly excluded from the export figures.
