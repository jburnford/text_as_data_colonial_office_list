KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the East African coastline from Umba River to Dick's Head, and territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a Commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew in 1893.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays a rent of 10,000l. per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1896 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the latter has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 224,960 square miles.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into nine Provinces.

1. The Nyanza Province, comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho, and Kisumu-Londiani.
2. The Nzoia Province comprising the districts of Nandi, Usin Gishu, Elgeyo, Marakwet, and Trans Nzoia.
3. The Turkana Province comprising the districts of North and South Turkana and West Suk.
4. The Rift Valley Province comprising the districts of Nakuru, Ravine, Baringo, Naivasha, and Laikipia.
5. The Masai Province comprising the districts of Narok and Kajiado.
6. The Kikuyu Province comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kyambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, North Nyeri, Embu, and Meru.
7. The Ukarasa Province comprising the districts of Machakos, Kitui, and Teita.
8. The Coast Province comprising the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, and Lamu.
9. The Northern Frontier Province comprising the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir, and Telemegger.

The Capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is also the largest centre in the Colony. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Europeans | Asiatics | Natives | Total |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1930 |           |          |         |       |
|      | 5,195     | 15,566   | 26,761  | 47,512|

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 43,250, of whom about 1,150 are Europeans. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours, Mombasa harbour on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the port. A Municipality was established at Mombasa in 1928.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 3,024,911. A census of the non-native population taken in March, 1931, showed a population as follows:

| Race       | Number |
|------------|--------|
| Europeans  | 16,842 |
| Indians    | 39,594 |
| Arabs      | 12,162 |
| Goans      | 3,959  |
| Other non-natives | 1,331 |

Total: 73,888

Africans (estimated): 2,951,023

Total: 3,024,911

On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Lumbwa, the Suk, the Turkana, the Masai, the Somalis, and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made some progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Under the Royal Instructions dated the 11th September, 1920, as amended by Additional Instructions dated the 7th July, 1928, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner, Commissioner for Local Government, Lands and Settlement, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, the Director of Agriculture, and Director of Education (ex officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further
provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, eleven ex officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, and one nominated unofficial member to represent the interests of the African community. Under royal instructions dated the 28th March, 1927, it was provided that if at any time the number of Indian elected members is less than five the vacancy or vacancies so arising might be filled by the appointment of nominated Indian unofficial members. The ex officio members are to be the ex officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate forms one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

Climate.

For purposes of rainfall Kenya may be divided into three parts:—

(1) Northern Desert area where there is usually less than 20 inches a year.

(2) The coastal strip and the Nyanza and Kikuyu Provinces where there may be from 40 to 80 inches a year, and

(3) The remainder of Kenya where rainfall is from 20 to 40 inches a year. On the Coast there is usually a single rainy season from April to November, but up-country there are generally "long" rains from April to June, and "short" rains from October to December. The Coastal regions have a tropical climate though nights are cool except during the hottest months from December to April. In the Highlands the climate is invigorating with cool breezes; at Nairobi the mean maximum shade temperature in 1930 was 70.5° F., and the mean minimum 54.3° F. The rainfall at Nairobi was 61.80 inches.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at Is. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw from circulation the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a rupee) have been withdrawn from circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a shilling) have been introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Treasurer.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26 Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret, and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe, and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Kitale in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) with which is amalgamated The National Bank of South Africa Ltd., has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kitale and Eldoret, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Land and Produce.

As the pursuit of agriculture is possible from sea level to altitudes of 9,000 feet or more, and the range of temperature is comparatively wide, tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate crops are grown.

The main producing areas are at an elevation of 3,000 feet and over, and with certain exceptions, such as hides and skins, the production of Europeans now exceeds that of the native population.

In the highlands coffee, maize, sisal, and wheat are the principal crops, and exports of these commodities are increasing steadily. The acreages under sugar-cane, tea, and wattle are extending, and the output of beans, potatoes, groundnuts and other crops and fruits of minor importance is being increased.

Extensive pasture grounds exist throughout the highlands and maintain considerable herds of grade and native stock. The export of hides and skins is considerable, and the dairy industry under European supervision is in a thriving condition, and producing increased supplies of butter for export.

In the Coastal section below 3,000 feet, maize, coconuts, sisal, cotton, sugar-cane, and miscellaneous native grains and oil seeds are grown.

The forest products of the Coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony, and gum copal. The highland forests contain large quantities of pencil Cedar and several other good timbers such as Podocarpus, Olive, and East African Camphor, also large areas of bamboo suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.
The mineral resources of the Colony are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; good quality mica has been discovered in the Suk district; mica diatomite and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kajiado, Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba and a gypsum deposit has been discovered near Simbe; gold prospecting activities exist south of Kisii. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

The total area of land alienated as at December 31st, 1930, was 6,894,080 acres, of which 6,377,899 acres were leasehold. In addition, there are 364,160 acres of Township and Government Reserves. Sale of leases of land by public auction has been resumed.

Trade and Customs.

Since 1917, Kenya and Uganda have been one administrative unit for purposes of Customs.

In 1923, a uniform Tariff for Kenya and Uganda, operating also in Tanganyika Territory, was adopted, and free trade between Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika Territory in goods, the growth produce or manufacture of each of the territories was established. In August, 1927, unrestricted trading was extended to imported goods passing between the territories, single payment of duty only being chargeable, and the Customs Revenue involved being credited to the consuming territory by inter-departmental entry.

In April, 1930, a uniform modernised Tariff was enacted in the three territories simultaneously.

Certain specially protected commodities (wheat flour, sugar, timber, etc.) are subject to a "suspended duty"; i.e., each Government has the right to vary the rate charged in its own territory up to the amount specified in the Tariff. At the same time each Government has undertaken not to remove any of the "suspended duties" without prior consultation with the other Governments concerned.

On 16th June, 1931, the Consumption Tax previously leviable on Wines and Spirits cleared for consumption in Kenya was incorporated in the common Tariff and certain increases in the rates of duty chargeable on vehicles and parts (including tyres and tubes) were imposed in the three territories.

The import tariff as it now stands admits free of duty goods essential to the agricultural, industrial, educational, and scientific development of the territories, and has been designed as far as possible to protect imports essential to the opening up and development of the country and to foster local production of agricultural and other commodities in which Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika Territory, taken as an economic unit, are, or can be made self-supporting.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of Trade Imports (excluding imports on Government Account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya Ports, were as follows:

| Years | Trade Imports | Total Customs Receipts | Tonnage |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
|       | £             | £                      | Tonnage |

The Union Castle Line and the British India Steam Navigation Co. maintain a monthly service of passenger steamers from and to London. The Union Castle vessels run either via the Cape or Suez.

The Messageries Maritimes from Marseilles to Madagascar call fortnightly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards.

The Compagnie Italiana Transatlantica have two lines calling monthly; one steamer running as far as Zanzibar, and back to Genoa, and the other as far as Durban, and also back to Genoa, calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland.

The Navigazione Libera Triestina Line also maintains a north and south service with Italian ports.
The Clan Ellerman Harrison Line maintains a three-weekly service of fast cargo steamers from Liverpool; also a service from the U.S.A. and Canada.

The Holland Afrika Line maintains a fortnightly service from London and continental ports to South and East Africa calling at this Port.

The Deutsche Ost Afrika Line maintains a three-weekly passenger and cargo service between Mombasa, Continental ports and Southampton.

The Osaka Shosen Kaisha Line and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, connect monthly with Japan.

A fortnightly Mail Service to Bombay and Durban is maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company's passenger and cargo steamers.

The Compagnie Maritime Belge maintain a monthly cargo service.

A bi-monthly passenger service is maintained with Batavia via southern ports by the Royal Packet Company of Holland.

Communication between the coastal ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co., Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw Bros., and the Compagnia Italiana Transatlantica.

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by a Central Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Colony (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On the 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda. It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the Governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway. The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory's representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

The length of the line, which is metre gauge, including branches open to traffic at the end of August, 1931 is 1,616 miles, excluding loops and industrial sidings.

The Railway Marine consists of the Lake Victoria, Lake Kioga, Lake Albert, and River Nile flotillas. Their respective strengths are as follows:

- Lake Victoria, 5 Steamers, total displacement 5346 Tons
- 4 Tugs, and 1 Launch.
- 35 Lighters, total capacity 3830 Tons

Lake Kioga, 3 Sternwheel Steamers
1 Launch

Lake Albert, 18 Lighters, total capacity 1900 Tons
and River Nile 4 Steamers and 4 Lighters.

The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda:

| Total Expenditure on Capital Account at the end of 1930 | 20,802,105L |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Revenue for 1930                                         | 2,214,229L  |
| Ordinary Working Expenditure excluding Loan and Redemption Charges, for 1930 | 1,441,285L |
| No. of Passengers carried                                | 1,106,106   |
| Goods carried (Revenue earning)                          |             |
| Tons                                                     | 1,005,041   |
| Total Steamer Mileages (all three services)              | 198,841     |

In 1927 the title of the Kenya and Uganda Railway was changed to that of Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and the Administration assumed control of the working of the Port of Mombasa and coastal ports.

The old harbour at Mombasa is now almost entirely used by dhows. Kilindini Harbour has been the scene of intensive development during the last eight years, and some £4 million pounds sterling have been expended there. There is now, in addition to the former lighterage quay, a deep-water quay having a length of approximately 3,000 feet. This quay can accommodate six ships alongside of the normal type using the port. The quay is served by 25 electric level-lifting cranes and there are five transit sheds, three of which are double storey. The total number of quay, shed and stacking ground cranes are 81 up to date. A jetty at which bulk oil ships discharge to tanks ashore has just been brought into use. A Harbour Advisory Board advises the High Commissioner for Transport on Port Matters.

Kilindini Harbour, at the Port of Mombasa is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana, which is navigable for about 400 miles by small shallow draft steamers. The bar at Kipini is an obstacle to navigation from the sea.

The Port of Kilifi consists of a land-locked Harbour, 30 miles North-East of Mombasa. It offers good anchorage for small vessels, and opens out into the Bandari Ya Walli, a bay about one-and-half miles wide, with shallow anchorage.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Kilifi.

The Port of Malindi is an open Harbour, 80 miles North East of Mombasa. Ships of any size can anchor off Malindi, but the anchorage is very exposed to the Monsoons. Cotton, Sim sim, and Copra are exported.

A District Officer resides at Malindi.

About three miles North of Malindi is the mouth of the Sabaki River. This river, which has recently been bridged about a mile from its mouth, passes through a country of great fertility, but is shallow and only navigable by canoes.

The Port of Lamu lies between Lamu and Manda Islands, 140 miles North-East of Mombasa. The town of Lamu, the most important Coast town North of Mombasa, is situated on Lamu Island. There is a good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, but the bar carries only 15 feet at low water. The exports are cocoanuts, copra, rope, mat bags, and some cattle.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Lamu.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The Post Office of the Colony (exclusive of Uganda, which is worked by the Kenya Post Office) received and despatched during 1931, 14,701,800 letters, packets, etc., and 605,991 telegrams.
The Telegraph and Telephone system has 12,480 miles of wire (exclusive of Uganda). The lines connect Mombasa with Lamu and Witu (184 miles), Mombasa with Gazi and Tanganyika Border (61 miles), Mombasa with Nairobi (332 miles), Voi with Kahe (92 miles), Konza with Lake Magadi (91 miles), Konza with Machakos (22 miles), Nairobi with Nyeri, Nanyuki, Meru and Isiolo (269 miles), Nairobi with Nakuru (123 miles), Kijabe with Narok (61 miles), Gilgil with Rumuruti (79 miles), Nakuru with Kisumu (137 miles), Kisumu to Uganda Border (89 miles), Lumbwa with Kericho and Chemagel (51 miles), Mahoroni with Songhor (10 miles), Kitibori with Eldoret (49 miles), Nakuru with Eldama Ravine and Eldoret (128 miles), Rongai with Lake Solai (27 miles), Eldoret with Kitale, Endebees and Kiminini (74 miles), Eldoret with Moiben (28 miles), Eldoret to Uganda Border (97 miles). Lines follow all Railway lines including branch lines. Communication between Mombasa and ships at sea, Italian Somaliland, and with Zanzibar (for Government traffic only) is maintained by means of radio-telegraphy. A cable connects Mombasa with Zanzibar. A short-wave wireless station, owned and maintained, under licence from Government, by the British East African Broadcasting Company Limited, is established at Nairobi and provides communication between the Colony and Protectorate and Great Britain.

Telegraph communication exists with Uganda and Tanganyika Territory. The Kenya telegraph system is also linked up via the Tanganyika Territory, Nyasaland and Rhodesian systems with the South African service. Communication with the Belgian Congo is maintained through Uganda with which the Belgian Congo system is linked up.

Telephone Exchanges are worked at Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Kitale, Kiambu, Koru, Ruiru, Kabete, Meru, Molo, Nyeri, Thika, Kericho, Kikuyu, Limuru, Njoro, Sotik, Soy, and Turbo. There is telephone communication between Mombasa and Tanganyika Territory.

2,403 telephones were in use in Kenya at the end of 1930.

Civil Aviation.

Civil aviation has shown rapid development in the Colony. Aerodromes have been established and are maintained by Government as Customs Aerodromes at Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kisumu.

Kisumu has also been developed as an air port. Other aerodromes are maintained by Government at Nakuru, Naivasha, Voi, and Makindu.

During the year 1930 negotiations were concluded between the Air Ministry and Messrs. Imperial Airways Limited for the establishment of an Air Service for the transport of passengers, mails and freights between Alexandria or Cairo and Cape Town. The section from Cairo via Kisumu to Mwanza was opened in March, 1931, and provides a regular weekly service between this country and England.

Operations of the southern section of the service to Cape Town was expected to begin early in 1932.

Africa in 1924, a first Conference of Governors of the British East African Dependencies was held in Nairobi in January and February, 1926, for the discussion of matters of mutual concern. It was then decided that a permanent Secretariat for the Conference should be established at Nairobi and conferences held as and when necessary.

G. Walker, D.S.O., who is also Secretary to the High Commissioner for Transport, Kenya and Uganda. Salary £1,500.
