THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of the Leeward Islands, with a total area of 708 square miles, consists of a number of islands belonging partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands Group) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. The islands of Antigua, Barbuda, St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Montserrat form a fairly compact group between the 61st and 63rd degree of west longitude and around the 17th degree of north latitude; but Dominica lies about 100 miles to the south, separated by the French island of Guadeloupe from the rest of the Colony, while Anguilla, Sombrero, and still more the Virginia group (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, etc.), lie apart to the north and north-west.

St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat and Dominica form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, whilst Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Politically the Colony is divided into five Presidencies:—Antigua (with Barbuda), St. Christopher and Nevis (with Anguilla), Dominica, Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. These have been united and separated at various times in their history, and were finally federated in 1871 by Imperial Act 34 and 35 Vict., cap. 107. Sombrero was added to the Colony by Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act on the 10th August, 1904, being attached to the Virgin Islands Presidency.

History.

The islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica, they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Presidencies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1832.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry (except in Dominica) and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to January.

Constitution.

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. The Legislative Council now consists of ten official and ten elected members. Three elected members are chosen by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, three by those of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis, and one by those of the Legislative Council of Montserrat. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. As there is no Legislative Council in the Virgin Islands, one member is appointed by the Governor to represent that Presidency. The official members are the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Federal Treasurer, the Administrators of St. Kitts-Nevis, and Dominica, and the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and such other person holding office under the Government of the Colony of the Leeward Islands as the Governor with the approval of the Secretary of State may appoint.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation, and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts for about one week.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the Legislative Body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal
Bank of Canada have branches in Antigua, St. Kitts, and Dominica, and the latter bank has a branch in Montserrat. In Nevis and the Virgin Islands there are no banks.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational in Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, the various denominations being Anglicans, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics. In the other Presidencies elementary education is provided by the Government. On 31st March, 1931, there were 110 aided and Government schools in the Colony. The clergy of the various denominations are granted facilities for giving religious instruction during school hours to the children of their respective churches. During the financial year 1930-31 the Government grants to all the elementary schools in the Colony amounted to 18,725/.

* Includes a Grant-in-Aid from the Imperial Govt. of £30,000.

‡ Exclusive of St. Kitts-Nevis figures, not yet received.
School fees have now been abolished in all public elementary schools throughout the colony. The schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. In the 110 aided and Government schools there were enrolled on 31st March, 1931, 26,412 children, with a daily average attendance of 17,951. For secondary education there are government grammar schools for boys in St. Kitts, Dominica and Montserrat, a private grammar school for boys in Antigua, private girls' high schools in Antigua and St. Kitts, and private mixed schools in Antigua, Nevis, St. Kitts (convent) and Dominica (convent).

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 902) and Redonda are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62½ square miles. Barbuda lies about 25 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 miles, is very flat, with a large lagoon on the west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was long owned by the Codrington family. It produces some salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing and horse rearing. Cotton is being grown with favourable results. Deer were introduced by the Codringtons. The island has communication with Antigua by a sailing-boat service. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 26 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 25° 6' N.lat., 61° 36' W. long., 1 mile by ¼ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered in 1865, formerly worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license and subject to an annual rental of 50l.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1663 Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. The island is in the main low-lying and has no forests. Rainfall:

| 1930 | 30°35     | 25°51               |

On the 22nd March, 1898, the Legislative Council, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated by the Governor, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new Council consists of sixteen members, eight official and eight non-official, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Governor presides. By Ordinance No. 7 of 1910, the duration of the Council is limited to three years.

The chief products are sugar and cotton. In 1930 11,435 acres were under sugar-cane or cotton, 1,400 under provisions, and 46,000 were uncultivated.

St. John, the chief town, has a population of 6,997, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1930, 23 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 401.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

This Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Anguilla. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population on 31st December, 1930, was estimated at 35,789, as compared with 38,214 at the census of 1921. The total area is about 152 square miles.

Constitution and Government.

In 1625 Mr. (afterwards Sir Thomas) Warner landed in St. Christopher, bearing a Royal Commission to the Earl of Carlisle, by which the islands of St. Christopher (or Merwar's Hope), Nevis, Barbados and Montserrat were taken under royal protection, and given over to his custody as the King's Lieutenant.

In 1671 St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla "and all other the Leeward Islands" were separated from Barbados and created the "Leeward Caribbee Islands Government," and Sir Charles Wheler was appointed "Captain-General" of the same. The chief seat of government was then at Nevis, but afterwards transferred to Antigua, and the government of each island, in the absence of the Captain-General, was administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, or, when none such was appointed, by the President of the Council.

In 1689 Colonel Christopher Codrington was appointed Governor-in-Chief, and his Commission, granted by William III., and dated 20th October, 1689, authorised him to call assemblies of freeholders and planters within any of the islands "jointly and severally to make laws for the public peace, welfare and good government of the said islands," thus providing for separate and federal legislatures. The Legislature in St. Christopher and in Nevis, as in the other islands of the government, consisted of two houses, a nominated Council and an elected Assembly, and had secured to it its own peculiar laws and local jurisdiction.

By Letters Patent, dated 26th April, 1816, the Commission originally granted to Sir William Stapleton was revoked, and the Leeward Caribbee Islands formed into two distinct governments, the first comprising Antigua, Montserrat and Barbuda, and the other St. Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd November, 1832, the General Government was restored, Dominica being for the first time included, and a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, with two Lieutenant-Governors for St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, and for Dominica respectively, were appointed, each island possessing a Legislative Council and House of Assembly, which continued, under the supervision of the Governor-in-Chief, to legislate for local interests.

In 1866 measures were introduced in each island to alter the constitution, and the two houses then existing were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, consisting of ex-officio members, nominees of the Crown, and representatives of the people elected under a limited franchise.

In 1878 the single chamber constitution was repealed in St. Kitts and in Nevis, and the Crown Colony form of government adopted in its stead, and in 1882 these two islands, with Anguilla, were united into one Presidency.

The office of Lieutenant-Governor, which existed until 1870, has been abolished, and the Presidency, in the absence thereofrom of the Governor, is under the immediate supervision of an Administrator.

There is one Executive Council for the Presidency, consisting of the Governor, the Administrator, certain ex-officio members, and such other persons as His Majesty may from time to time appoint. The Legislative Council consists of seven official and seven nominated unofficial members, besides the Governor and the Administrator. Of the unofficial members not more than six shall be from among the people of St. Kitts and Anguilla, and one at least from among the people of Nevis. The Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator, or, in the absence of both of them, a member of the Council appointed in writing, presides, and the President of the Council enjoys an original and a casting vote. The Council meets at the town of Basseterre in St. Kitts.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

Sugar is the principal crop in St. Kitts (150,937 tons of cane in 1930 crop, from 6,883 acres, 18,680 tons of sugar manufactured). It is grown in the Basseterre Valley and on the lower slopes round the island (the northern side showing the best average yield), and the cane is crushed and sugar produced at a central factory a mile from Basseterre. A light railway for haulage of canes encircles the island. The sugar industry is at present suffering severe depression.

The only other important crop in St. Kitts is cotton, the lint produced in 1930 being 397,763 lbs. on 2,000 acres. Successful efforts are being made to encourage the growing of tomatoes and other vegetables for export to Canada.

Cotton and coconuts are the chief products exported from Nevis, but the latter crop has suffered severely from the effects of the 1928 hurricane.

Vegetables and cattle, chiefly for export to St. Kitts and for local consumption, are also produced in Nevis.

Salt is the chief product of Anguilla, and is also produced from ponds at the south eastern part of St. Kitts, the combined quantity in 1930 being 1,492 tons.

Anguilla also produced, in 1930, 26,505 lbs. cotton.

There are no manufacturing industries (other than the manufacture of sugar) in the Presidency.
The Customs import tariff is mainly on an ad valorem basis. A preferential reduction varying in amount, but in most cases equal to one third of the general rate, is accorded to British products. The percentages of trade is as follows:

United Kingdom . . . . . . 33
Other British countries . . . . 35
U.S. of America . . . . . . 24
Other foreign countries . . . . 8

Education.

There are four secondary schools:—a Government grammar school for boys in St. Kitts, a girls' high school in St. Kitts and a mixed school in Nevis, both state-aided, and a school by the Roman Catholic Sisters.

There are 31 Government primary schools (16 in St. Kitts, including 4 in Basseterre, 10 in Nevis and 5 in Anguilla) and also a Roman Catholic school and a few small private schools.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land, within which are the salt ponds.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 3,711 feet above the sea. A branch of this range encloses the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the principal town, with a population of about 8,000. Near the town of Sandy Point is Brimstone Hill, strongly fortified and fiercely besieged during the French wars. It is quite isolated, and about 750 feet in height.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island. The higher slopes of the mountains are covered with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood. The island is of volcanic formation, and the soil, save in the mountains (where it is clayey) is peculiarly light and porous, sandy yet fertile.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The highest temperature in the shade is about 88°, the lowest 66°, and the mean average about 76°.

The average rainfall in St. Kitts for the year 1930 was 45.98 inches.

St. Christopher or St. Kitts, the Carib name of which was Liamuliga, "The Fertile Isle," was the first settled of the British West Indies, the settlement having been founded by Mr. Thomas Warner and other settlers, who landed on the 28th January, 1623, at the present village of Old Road. Later, French settlements were formed at the two ends of the island. The whole island was finally assigned to England under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 40' N. lat., and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonised by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, has a population of about 1,100. The population of Nevis largely consists of peasant proprietors.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 15,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,596 feet above the sea.

The soil is very different from that of St. Kitts, being of stiff clay, encumbered everywhere with volcanic boulders.

There are hot mineral springs adjoining the Bath House Hotel near Charlestown. These springs have valuable medicinal properties.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Kitts, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which, however, lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands. The distance between Basseterre (St. Kitts) and Charlestown (Nevis) is about twelve miles.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is situated in 18° 12' N. lat., and 63° 5' W. long., about 60 miles N.W. of St. Kitts, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

Unlike the mountainous volcanic islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla consists of Oligocene limestone and clay and its highest point is 213 ft. above sea level.

The inhabitants are peasant proprietors under the jurisdiction of a medical officer who is also magistrate.

The island is healthy, but suffers from want of an adequate water supply.

Besides sheep and goats the chief product is salt. Sea Island cotton is cultivated.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 158° 40' N. lat., and 618° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.: 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 304 square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque, rising at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin to 4,747 feet. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of 312,092l. 11s. 1d. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed a unit of a General Government, which comprised Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, a Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval expedition against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of it on the 7th of September.

after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was appointed Governor. Trade failed, and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican leader, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now referred to in the island for marking the time of events, by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts, near the town of Portsmouth.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H. L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of 15,000l. by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the Island.

Considerable areas in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the Maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is good and the climate healthy. Limes and cocoa flourish throughout the coastal zone. The former, however, are being rapidly wiped out by root disease, but this critical situation is being combated by planting limes budded on resistant stocks on a considerable scale. The higher slopes in the centre of the island are well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, nutmeg, spices and such tropical fruits that require humid conditions.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, volcanic ash covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers, with fish in some, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Lime-juice, cocoa, coconuts, copra, and fruit (including green limes, grapefruit and oranges) are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, has now ceased to be made. A considerable trade is carried on also in spices, oils, and timber, 1930: cocoa, 6,826l.; essential oils, 51,012l.; vanilla, 2,112l.; limes and lime juice (limes, 26,191l., Cone. lime juice, 5,729l., R. lime juice, 9,800l./41,720l.; coconuts, 404l.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1930 was 72·79 inches; the average for the whole island was 106 inches; the mean temperature 78 Fahr. (Roseau).

The chief town is Roseau, with a population of 6,803 according to the census of April, 1921; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1929, 10 vessels, of a total tonnage of 197 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north-west of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) at Roseau, and one of the Royal Bank of Canada, established in April, 1915.

There is a Government telephone system of 542 miles, with 7 exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 8 members. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abrogating itself, and substituting the Crown Colony system. A Legislative council was created, consisting of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. Ordinance No. 21 of 1924, provides for the election of four of the unofficial members of the council. The Administrator presides in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency.

A considerable number of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is becoming general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the Island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1298, 1902).

According to the Census of 1921 there are about 420 Caribs in the Island, of whom about 141 are estimated as of pure blood.

MONTSERRAT.

This Island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 32½ square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Chance's Mtn. (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of 1,730, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1927, 4 sailing vessels, total tonnage 134 tons net.

Montserrat was colonised by the Irish in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1783.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. In 1861, these were replaced by a single Chamber of eight elected and four nominated members.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, this Chamber was replaced by a Legislative Council of not more than six nominated members. By Act No. 2, of 1902, which rescinded these Acts, the number of members was limited to four. Ordinance No. 4 of
1909 repealed No. 2 of 1902 and limited the tenure of office of the members of the Council to three years. Ordinance No. 2 of 1911 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number of members to six. Ordinance No. 18 of 1922 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number to eight. Unofficial representation on the General Legislative Council of the L.I. has now been provided for.

The cultivation of sugar, once the staple industry of the island, has declined, and onions and cotton are now the principal products. The lime cultivation, which was considerably extended recently, has suffered a severe set back by the hurricane of 12th-13th September, 1928, but is being rehabilitated.

The cultivation of Sea Island cotton, which was once grown during the American Civil War, was re-introduced in 1901, and, where the lands are suitable, has superseded the sugar industry.

There is a small industry in producing tomatoes for supply in winter to Canada. In the 1930 season 17,000 crates were shipped having a gross value of £3,500.

Among the other exports may be mentioned a drug known as "papain;" essential oils, lime juice, cotton-seed oil, cattle and green vegetables.

There are eight Anglican schools with 1,592 scholars, three Wesleyan with 813, one Roman Catholic with 303, and one undenominational with 251 scholars.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects.

On 7th August, 1899, the island was devastated by a hurricane; and again on 28th August, 1924, and 12th September, 1928.

There is telephonic communication throughout the Island; a Wireless Station was erected in 1925.

The island is considered to be one of the most healthy of the Antilles. Death-rate 1930, 19.8 per 1,000. Birth-rate 1930, 40 per 1,000.

The rainfall in 1930 averaged 37.12 inches at 12 stations; and the mean temperature was 74° minimum and 84° maximum.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to eastward of and adjacent to Porto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dykes, Peter Island, Salt Island, and all others not in the possession of the United States of America. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. A lighthouse is maintained by the Board of Trade on Sombrero, which was first included in the Colony in 1904.

The Americans possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the Constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted, to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members, to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government. This Ordinance was repealed May 1st, 1902, since when the Governor of the Leeward Islands ordains the laws. There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Road Town, Tortola, population (1921) 437, which is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1929, 6 vessels, registered total tonnage, 58.

Road Town, which is well built and clean, is provided with well stocked shops and stores. There is a small modern Hospital with a European Matron in charge.

The cultivation of sea island cotton, once the principal industry of the Virgin Islands, has been abandoned in consequence of the destruction wrought by the Pink Boll Worm. A tobacco industry has been started, and cigars are manufactured for export. Attempts are being made to establish other industries. The land is admirably adapted for the growth of coconuts, sugar-cane, tobacco, sisal, etc.

A small quantity of sugar is made for local consumption, also rum.

The percentage of trade with the United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empire and the principal Foreign countries is 25%, 5% and 70% respectively. Under the Customs Tariff the preferential rate charged on imports from Empire countries is in general two-thirds of the general rate.

A large area of land in the Virgin Islands is well adapted to coconut cultivation, and the existing trees are quite free from any serious insect or fungoid pests.

The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands, makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy, intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their trade and intercourse is with the Virgin Islands of the U.S., and to a smaller extent with Hayti and San Domingo.

The currency consists almost entirely of foreign money, which circulates at the following rates of exchange: Danish money at 25 francs to 1l., American money at $5 to 1l.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great. The average annual rainfall at Road Town is about 54 inches.

The birth and death rates per 1,000 in 1930 were 39·8 and 12·5 respectively.

Large quantities of fibrous plants (agaves and bromelias) grow wild everywhere in Tortola.

The mail communication is weekly by Government motor launch to St. Thomas. Mails are also despatched to St. Thomas nearly every day, letters for Europe being usually sent via Porto Rico and New York weekly.

**MALTA.**

**Situation and Area.**

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 94-870 square miles; that of Gozo, 25-899 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are mere islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

**History.**

The Maltese Islands were inhabited as early as the beginning of the Mousterian cultural period, about 40,000 B.C., by Neanderthal man, of whom remains were discovered in a cave to the southeast of Malta. Traces of paleolithic civilization are not wanting in the islands, and evidence of a neolithic civilization, in the shape of cave dwellings, stone circles, menhirs and dolmens, is found all over the islands. The Phoenicians probably took possession of Malta as soon as they made themselves masters of the Mediterranean Sea. Phoenician remains are few, but there are numerous rock-cut graves of Phoenician type.

At the beginning of the Punic wars the islands were held by Carthage. In the course of the first Punic war they changed hands more than once, but at its conclusion they were still in the possession of the Carthaginians. In 218 B.C., they passed finally to Rome. Under the Romans Malta appears to have enjoyed great prosperity. Diodorus Siculus speaks of the excellence of its harbours, the wealth of its inhabitants, and its many skilful artificers, and refers to its fertility, and Cicero, in the Verrine orations, speaks of it as abounding in riches and famous for its textile manufactures. Inscriptions show that it enjoyed municipal rights in the time of Hadrian, and an interesting fact in its recorded history is that it was the scene of St. Paul's shipwreck (Acts xxviii.). On the final division of the Empire in 395 A.D., Malta fell to the share of the Byzantine Emperor, and for the next four centuries its history is almost a blank. In the 9th century it was three times invaded by the Arabs, who finally conquered it in 870, the Byzantine garrison being massacred in an insurrection of the inhabitants.

In 1090, Count Roger the Norman, with a handful of men, subjected the islands to Sicily. The Sicilian domination lasted for four hundred years, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and Castilian ruling in turn. During this time, Malta had Sicilian governors and laws, but there is no record of any extensive Sicilian immigration, and the persistence of the old Semitic names in the parish registers, instituted at this period, stands as further evidence that no great ethnographic changes occurred.

The connexion with Sicily was broken in 1530, when the Emperor Charles V gave Malta to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who had been driven from Rhodes by the Turks, and who held Malta until 1798. The loyalty of the Maltese to their new sovereigns, who for the first time were resident in the island, was put to a severe test on several occasions, the most notable being the great siege of 1565, when the Order of St. John, under Grand Master Jean de la Valette, resisted the attacks of the land and sea forces of Solyman the Magnificent. It was after this great feat of
arms that the city of Valletta was built, strong enough to defy the Turkish attacks threatened yearly by the Sultan.

Napoleon Bonaparte invested the island on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda, and, on the 12th July, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed.

The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the re-commencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Climate.

The climate of Malta is equable and very healthy in winter. In July the heat at the sea level approaches that experienced in sub-tropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind. The mean maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 65° Fahr., and the mean minimum 44°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the mean maximum is 89° Fahr., and the mean minimum 65°. The mean temperature is 64°, and the mean annual rainfall is 21 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous sandstone beds and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

Industry.

The island is highly cultivated. Besides products for home consumption, early potatoes, onions, cumin seed and oranges are exported. A large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepot and port of call. It is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1930, 36 vessels, 6,000 gross tonnage.

Chief Towns.

The chief town and capital is Valletta, having, with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's, a population which, in April, 1931, when a census was last taken, was 51,898. The "Three Cities" (Senglea, Cospicua, and Vittoriosa) have a population of 27,149. Citta Vecchia, the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, had a population of 10,032. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), with a population of about 5,351.

Inhabitants and Language.

The Maltese language, which is generally spoken, is of Semitic origin, and is akin to Arabic. The educated and commercial classes also speak English, and some Italian. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found in Algeria, Gibraltar, the Regency of Tunis, Egypt, Canada, Australia, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is, under Order in Council of September 24th, 1886, and Ordinance I of 1929, exclusively British. There are two local banks (Banco di Malta and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and branches of Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), the Banco di Roma, and the Crédit Foncier d'Algérie et de Tunisie. There is also Siciluna's Bank which is a private bank. The amount of British Treasury currency notes and Bank of England notes in circulation on 31st March, 1931, was roughly estimated at £50,000. The Government savings bank was established in 1833. On 31st March, 1931, the deposits amounted to 1,053,153£ with 11,064 depositors.

Means of Communication.

The railway, which is of metre gauge, is 7¼ miles long; it was originally built by the Malta Railway Company at the cost of about 100,000£. The railway became the property of the Local Government in 1890, under a clause of the concession which provided that if the service was suspended for a certain period, the railway would be forfeited to the Government. An electric tramway service was started in 1905, connecting the principal towns and some of the villages with Valletta. There is a telephone exchange with 785 miles of wires. Malta is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables to Alexandria (3), Gibraltar (3), Bone (2), Messina (1), Tripoli (1), Sicily (1), and Zante (1).

Malta is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is an important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling at any hour, day and night. There is direct mail communication with several Mediterranean ports and with England. The rates of postage are as follows:

Public Works.

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and greatly improved their sanitary condition. New drainage works were commenced in 1899, and Cottonera, Sliema, St. Julian's, Misida, Pietà, Calcara, Zabbar, Hamrun, Curmi, Rabato Tarxien, Paula, Luqa, Zejtun, Birchircara, Balzan, and Attard, part of Casal Lia and other places have been drained. The waterworks have also been much improved, and have now been extended to all the Malta villages and to Gozo. Considerable progress has been made in public lighting, and in improving the roads and streets in accordance with the exigencies of modern
traffic. Electric lighting has been installed, and current is being supplied to the following places, Valletta, Floriana, Sliema, including the two harbours, St. Julian's, St. George's, Pietà, Misida, Hamrun, Marsa, Birkirkara, Curmi, Lia and Balzan, Attard, Naxaro, the Three Cities, Rabato and Notabile, Musta, Paula, Tarxien, Zejtun, Zebbug, Calcares, Zebbug, Bir. ebugia, and Victoria, Gozo.

Constitution.

A Council of Government, partly elected, was constituted by Letters Patent in 1849, and reconstituted in 1887, the Letters Patent being amended in 1898 and again in 1903.

By Letters Patent dated April 14th, 1921, responsible government was established in Malta. The Letters Patent were proclaimed by the Governor at Valletta on 30th April, 1921, and became fully effective when, elections for the Senate and Legislative Assembly having been held, the newly constituted Legislature was formally, on 1st November, 1921, declared open in His Majesty's name by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales.

The previously existing Council of Government gave place to a Legislature composed of two Houses—the Senate and Legislative Assembly.

The Legislature.—The Senate consists of seventeen members, eight of whom form a quorum. Ten of the seventeen are called "Special Members" and represent the Clergy, Nobility, the Graduates, the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union Council. The two members of the Clergy are nominated by the Archbishop of Malta, and the other eight are elected, in pairs, by the four special classes of electors whom they represent. The remaining seven Senators are called "General Members," and for their election Malta and Gozo are divided into two constituencies, one of which (Valletta and its environs) returns four senators, and the other (the remoter portions of Malta and Gozo), three. The voters for the special classes must be male British subjects over 21 years of age, and must have special qualifications, which are laid down in the Constitution Letters Patent. The voters for the General Members must be male British subjects over 21, able to read and write, and either paying £20 a year in rent or in possession of £20 a year from real property in Malta or other capital. Any person entitled to vote as a special elector may stand for election by his special class. A person qualified to vote for the general senators may be elected to the Senate upon fulfilling certain conditions, of which the most important are that he be an ecclesiastic of the higher orders, or hold a degree of the University, or be worth £100 a year, or pay rent to that amount.

The Senate continues in being for six years after election, unless sooner dissolved by the Governor.

The Legislative Assembly consists of 32 members. These are returned in groups of four by each of the eight electoral districts constituted by the Letters Patent (now repealed) of 3rd June, 1903; Malta being divided into seven districts, whilst Gozo forms one. Any male British subject who is over 21 years of age, and who either can read or write, or is worth £5 a year, or pays £5 a year in rent may vote in a constituency, and any person entitled to vote may be elected for any division. No person on full pay in the Navy, Army, or Air Force maintained by Imperial funds may, unless he has a legal domicile in Malta, be registered or vote.

For both Houses the first elections were held upon the principle of proportional representation. The Legislative Assembly continues in being for three years after election unless sooner dissolved by the Governor.

A person cannot be a member of both Houses, and a person elected to both Houses must elect in which he will sit.

The Maltese Legislature may not pass laws touching the public safety and defence of the Empire, or the general interest of British subjects outside Malta. In addition to this general reservation certain subjects are specifically withheld from its legislative competence. The principal subjects so reserved are matters dealing with the defence of the island, and naval, military or aerial matters generally, external trade, immigration, aliens, and coinage. Measures passed affecting a local Government matter (highways, buildings, territorial waters, etc.) which apply to Imperial property must be reserved by the Governor for the Royal Assent, and do not become operative unless that Assent is given within a year.

The Legislature (provided that two-thirds of each House are in favour) may pass a law to repeal any of the provisions of the Constitution, except those relating to reserved matters, or relating to Religious Toleration, Language, or the Reserved Civil List.

Elaborate provisions are made for the contingency of a difference of opinion between the two Houses as to a legislative measure. These provide for joint sittings, a dissolution and other arrangements intended to give time for reflection and compromise, and, ultimately to give effect to the considered opinion of a two thirds' majority of the two Houses sitting together.

Power is reserved to His Majesty to disallow any law passed by the Legislature and assented to by the Governor within one year of the giving of that assent, and the Governor may reserve any Bill for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure thereon. H.M. in Council or the Governor, subject to H.M.'s approval, may make laws dealing with the "reserved matters" described in the Constitution Letters Patent.

The Ministry.—There is provision for seven Ministries in the Government, to which Ministers may be appointed by the Governor in His Majesty's name, and these include the heads of twelve departments—Justice, Treasury, Public Instruction, Public Health, etc. Ministers must sit in one House, and do not vacate their seats on appointment. They may sit and speak, but not vote, in either House. There is a Chief Justice and five judges, whose salaries and tenure are secured by amendments inserted in the Constitution since its publication.

The Roman Catholic religion is by law the religion of the country; but full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship are guaranteed, and persons of any faith may hold any office.

Language.—English, and Italian as the language of the Maltese Courts, are the official languages of Malta. All administration is carried on in English, but in notices and documents an Italian translation may accompany the English text so far as desirable and convenient. No legislative or administrative act may be done which will diminish or detract from the position of the English language, or tend to restrict its use in education or the public service. The English and Italian languages are recognised as equal languages of culture in Malta at the University, in Secondary
Schools, and in the higher classes of Elementary Schools as subjects of study.

Italian remains the official language of the Courts. Persons, however, who do not understand Italian, but understand English, have the right to have the proceedings conducted in that language.

The Maltese language, which is the language of general intercourse among all classes in the Islands, is the language of instruction in the lower standards of the Elementary Schools, and is one of the languages recognised in Parliament and in the Courts.

Finance.—The revenue from all sources is paid into a Consolidated Fund, out of which the Public Service is supplied. The Legislature provides for audit and (subject to an obligation to pay the Reserved Civil List) controls expenditure. Money bills must originate in the Lower House and may not be altered by the Senate, but the Senate may return a money bill with their suggestions, which the Lower House must consider. The Senate may, finally, reject a money bill, but may not alter it. The Legislature can only appropriate money out of the Consolidated Fund or alter or impose taxation upon a recommendation of the Governor (advised by his Ministers), and money may only be paid out of the Treasury upon a Governor’s Warrant to the Treasurer. The Consolidated Fund has to defray the expenses of the Maltese Imperial Government, and to pay any other sum which the Governor declares to the Lower House to be necessary either to pay the expenses of the Nominated Council, the Privy Council (see infra) or the Joint Committee of the Privy Council, or to meet other expenses entailed in dealing with questions as to reserved matters.

Appointments to Public Offices in Malta (except those of Ministers) are made by the Governor in Council. The Crown reserves power at any time to revoke or amend all or any of the provisions relating to reserved matters, language in debates, religious toleration, language generally, and the Reserved Civil List.

The Reserved Civil List covers the charges for the Maltese Imperial Government (that is for the Governor’s salary and establishment, and the salaries and establishments of the Lieutenant-Governor and Legal Adviser), and also the Judges’ salaries.

Councils.

The Governor is assisted by two Councils—an Executive Council, consisting of such of the Ministers as he selects, and a Nominated Council, consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor and Legal Adviser (who are ex-officio members) and three Officers chosen from the Navy, Army and Air Force. The Governor may summon these two Councils to sit together as the “Privy Council of Malta.” When any legislative or administrative act is done or proposed which in the Governor’s opinion affects a reserved matter, he may submit the consideration of it to a Joint Committee consisting of three members of the Nominated Council appointed by himself, and three members of the Executive Council appointed by the Head of the Ministry.

Education and Religion.

Elementary education is carried on principally in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are two secondary schools with 234 scholars, 5 central schools and 33 elementary schools and 60 night schools with an average enrolment of 29,110 pupils, and an average attendance of 24,764. There is a public Lyceum with 384 day scholars, and 426 who attend evening classes, and a university (founded in 1769) with an average attendance of about 100 students. At these two latter institutions the fees are comparatively low, ranging from 80s. to 120s. per annum in the Lyceum and not exceeding 6s., exclusive of laboratory and other fees, per annum for all lectures in the University. There are numerous private, elementary and secondary schools. The total number of these schools is about 46, with an approximate attendance of 4,500 pupils. Education is not compulsory, but attendance is obligatory for all pupils on the registers of a Government Elementary School.

Revenue.

The most important sources of revenue are the Customs duties, licences, stamp duties, succession and donation duties, fees of office and reimbursements, post office, water and electricity receipts, land revenue, interest, and Public Lotto profits.

Weights and Measures.

Malta barrel is equal to 9½ imperial gallons.

“ salm ” 1 quarter.

“ cantar ” 175 lbs. English.

“ caffino ” 4½ imperial gallons.

Public Debt.

There is, strictly speaking, no public debt in Malta, but interest at 2½% is paid by the Government on 79,081l. outstanding balance on 31st
March, 1931, of the debt known as "Massa Frumentaria," incurred by the Municipality of Valletta under the Government of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, in connection with the monopoly of the trade of wheat. The funds of the "Massa Frumentaria" were, in 1798, appropriated by the French Government, then in occupation of the Island.
