VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of rocks; the largest island in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The Danes also possess some of them; the more important of which are St. Thomas, St. John, and Santa Croix; whilst the Spaniards lay claim to those near Porto Rico.

A civil government, and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

Constitution: In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government, who is to preside at the meetings of the Council, and to have a casting as well as a deliberation vote.

There is also an Executive Council.

Sugar is made in a small quantity in the Virgin Islands, and recently many of the landed proprietors have planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly, and appears likely to prove remunerative.

On October 29th, 1867, the islands were visited by a fearful hurricane, which was most destructive to life and property. Sir Arthur Rumbold's account is as follows:

"The storm lasted from eleven a.m. to three p.m., but the greatest force was from twelve to two. In that brief space of time, two-thirds of the miserable tenements of the town were blown down. The gaol is destroyed, the church, the hospital, pier, school-house, Wesleyan Chapel, and Poor-house are also destroyed, and my own dwelling unroofed and rendered uninhabitable.

"The loss of life cannot yet be correctly ascertained. I have, however, been officially informed of above twelve deaths in the town, two at Peter's Island, two at West End; while I hear that a quantity of people are killed in other parts of the country and scarcely a hut or habitation is left standing.

"All was bright and verdant, the withering blast has passed over it, and not a fruit or other..."
tree remains. The works of the few remaining estates are all totally destroyed."

The islands also suffered severely, but not to so great an extent, in the hurricane of August, 1871.

**DOMINICA.**

Dominica is an Island, situate in the centre of the Caribbean Sea, between 15° 20' and 15° 45' N. lat., and 61° 13' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16' broad; very mountainous and picturesque; was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd November, 1493, on his second voyage.

This island was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations. In 1756, Dominica became by conquest a dependency of England.

By the ninth article of the peace, signed at Paris between England and France in 1763, Dominica was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling the cultivatable lands, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of 312,092l. 11s. 1d. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising, besides Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart.

On the 21st June, 1775, the Royal Proclamation was issued, fixing a qualification for candidates and electors for the House of Assembly, and regulating the proceedings at elections, which is still in force.

In 1771, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor; trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795, another invasion of the island was attempted under the direction of Victor Hughes, the French Republican Chief, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadaloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prevost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Rupert's, making ready for battle, should they be attacked. Since this period the island has not known war.

The extent of the island is estimated at 186,436
It abounds in rivers and rivulets, well stocked with fish, and there is abundance of game in the island.

The Local Government is administered by a President, aided by an Executive Council of seven members. In 1865, during the temporary administration of Mr. (now Sir) W. C. F. Robinson, now Governor of the Straits Settlements, the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members, to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The president presides over the deliberations of this body, and exercises a casting vote in the House, and a deliberative as well as a casting vote in Committee.

The qualification for the representative of a parish is 50 acres of land, and for a representative of the town of Roseau or Portsmouth, 50 acres of land, or a messuage in the same town rented at 20l. per annum.

Electors for a parish must possess 10 acres in the parish, or house or building to be rented at 4l. per annum. For the towns of Roseau and Portsmouth, a house or building in the town worth 18l. per annum, or 8l. per annum for life out of and charged on lands or tenements.

The elected members of the Dominica Assembly send two members to the General Legislature of the Leeward Islands.
