GIBRALTAR.

The Rock of Gibraltar was captured by the British Forces on the 24th of July, 1704. The territory consists of an elevated promontory, running southwards. Its greatest elevation is 1,439 feet, its length is 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ½ of a mile.

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called the Bay of Gibraltar, which is about 4 or 5 miles across, and affords good anchorage for the shipping passing through the straits. Gibraltar is now extensively used as a port of call by such shipping, and it is also an entrepôt of the trade between England and the Arabian states of Northern Africa, for which it has many advantages, having been ever since its occupation by the British a free port.

The revenue is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, and trifling dues upon packages and wine, and a few licence duties.

The eastern face of the Rock is an inaccessible precipice. The larger portion of the town lies on the northern portion of the west slope of the Rock. It is one of the most thickly inhabited places in the world, the population being at the rate of 60,000 to the square mile; but, owing probably to a well-devised scheme of drainage and water supply, the town is very healthy.

The two portions of the town are separated by a picturesque public garden, called the Alemada, the improvement of which is now engaging the attention of the local Government.

There is no Executive Council, nor any legislative body; the Governor, who is also the General commanding the garrison, exercising by himself all the functions of government and legislation.

Total Population (exclusive of Military) according to Census of 1871, 18,695; Military, 6,521.
