LABUAN.

The island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 14' N. lat., and 115° 19' E. long. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of Borneo proper, about thirty miles.

The island was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846, and occupied in 1848.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, the development of which was at once undertaken by a Company which was formed in England at the time, under the name of "The Eastern Archipelago Company." Nevertheless, the coal resources of Labuan remain still undeveloped, and more than one Company has failed and retired from the undertaking.

"The Oriental Coal Company," which now hold a lease of the mines from the Crown, are a Scotch Company, having their offices in Leith. They entered upon the occupation of the mines in May, 1868, engaging to pay an annual rental to the Crown of £1,000.

Labuan has a fine port, and is a market for some of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo, such as bees'-wax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, india-rubber, pearls, tortoise-shell, and trepang, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore.

There are three sago manufactories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is likewise forwarded for the Singapore market.

The Government is administered by a Governor and a nominated Legislative Council.

Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant in aid, but since then the colony has supported
LABUAN—LEEWARD ISLANDS.

In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony.

**THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.**

The Leeward Islands, comprising the Colonies of Antigua, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The text of the Act, which is given below, will explain the constitution and powers of the Federal Government and the relations between that Government and the several Island Governments. Sir Benjamin Pine, to whose energy and ability the passage of the measure in the islands is largely due, was honoured by Her Majesty after the passing of the Imperial Act with the dignity of a Knight Commander of the order of St. Michael and St. George; Messrs. Wigley and Freeling, the administrators of St. Kitts and Dominica, being on the same occasion made Companions of the Order, and Sir Oliver Nugent, President of the Legislative Council of Antigua, receiving the honour of Knighthood.

The Federal Colony contains 120,499 inhabitants. Its total exports, according to latest returns, were 432,244l., and its imports 412,704l. The aggregate revenue of all the six Presidencies was 92,592l.; their expenditure, 96,500l.

It may be mentioned, as of historical interest, that the Leeward Islands possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several Islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common discoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1838, by the Act 3 and 4, Will. IV, c. 74. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave melioration Act, which was allowed, a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1832 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871 is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands.

Subjoined is the text of the Act.

**CHAP. 107.**

An Act for the Federation and general Government of the Leeward Islands. [21st August, 1871.]

Whereas the several legislative bodies of Her Majesty's Leeward Islands have, by certain resolutions, signified their desire for the union of the said Islands under one Government in manner therein set forth, and have requested that the said resolutions may be embodied in an Act of the Imperial Parliament with all such provisions as may necessary to give them full force and effect, and it is expedient that the said union should be established:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same as follows:—

17. The constitution and procedure of the Council:
18. Such other subjects in respect of each presidency as the Island Legislature thereof may declare to be within the competency of the General Legislature.

11. Subject to the provisions of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sections of this Act, the Governor may, with the consent of the Legislative Body of any presidency, make laws for the peace, order, and good government thereof, but any island enactment relating to any of the subjects named in the preceding section may at any time be repealed or altered by the General Legislature, and shall, without any formal repeal, be void so far as it is repugnant to any law passed by the General Legislature.

12. The Council may from time to time be convoked, prorogued, and dissolved by any instrument under the hand and seal of the Governor.

"I, A.B., do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and successors, according to law.

"So help me GOD."

But any person authorized by law to affirm or declare instead of taking an oath may make such affirmation or declaration in lieu of the said oath.

17. The Council shall appoint one of the members of the Council to be vice-president thereof.

18. Every member of the Council, except the official members, may resign his seat therein by writing under his hand addressed to the Governor.

19. Every elective member who shall accept any
office under the Crown shall vacate his seat in the said Council, but shall be eligible for re-election.

20.

21. Until otherwise determined by the Council, the Council shall not be considered as constituted for the despatch of business unless at least eleven members be present and assisting thereat.

22. Questions arising in the Council shall be decided by a majority of voices; the President shall, in all cases, have a vote, and when the voices are equal the decision shall be deemed to be in the negative.

23. No vote or resolution shall be proposed in the Council having for its object to charge any part of the revenues arising within the said Leeward Islands, except by one of the official members, or with the express approval or direction of the Governor.

24. When a Bill passed by the Council is presented to the Governor for his assent, he shall declare according to his discretion either that he assents thereto, or that he refuses his assent to the same, or that he reserves the same for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure thereon.

25. When the Governor assents to a Bill, he shall by the first convenient opportunity send an authentic copy of the law to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and it shall be lawful for Her Majesty at any time within eighteen months after such copy shall have been received by the said Secretary of State to notify to the Governor her disallowance of such law through one of her Principal Secretaries of State, and every such law shall become null and void from and after the day on which the said Governor shall signify such disallowance by message to the Council, or from and after a day to be named by proclamation.

26. A Bill reserved for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure shall take effect so soon as Her Majesty shall have given her assent to the same by Order in Council, and the Governor shall have signified such assent by message to the Council or proclamation, provided that no such message or proclamation shall be issued after two years from the day on which the Bill was presented to the Governor for his assent.

27. The Council shall at its first meeting, and may from time to time afterwards, as occasion may require, adopt standing rules and orders for the orderly conduct of business, which rules and orders shall take effect when confirmed by the Governor.

28. The expenses of such establishments as are common to all the Leeward Islands, other than the remuneration and travelling expenses of the members of the Council, shall be fixed by the Council, and shall, until otherwise apportioned by the Council, be divided into sixteen parts, which shall be charged as follows:

- On Antigua . . . . . 5 parts.
- St. Christopher . . . . 4 "
- Dominica . . . . . 3 "
- Nevis . . . . . 2 "
- Montserrat . . . . . 1 "

29. An estimate of such expenses shall be every year prepared by the General Government and laid before the Council, and when passed by the Council shall be published in the Leeward Islands; and after such publication the Governor may, from time to time, as the occasion may require, draw on the public treasury of each presidency for the whole or any part of the amount due from such presidency.

30. The Council may, by any law or laws, alter from time to time any of the provisions of this Act: Provided that every such law shall be reserved by the said Governor for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure.

31. The term Governor or officer administering the Government, when used in any island enactment heretofore passed, shall, after this Act shall come into operation, and until otherwise provided by the Island Legislature, be taken to mean the Governor of the Leeward Islands or any other person appointed in that behalf by writing under his hand and under the Public Seal of the Presidency.

32. The powers conferred on Her Majesty by the fifth, sixth, and ninth sections of this Act may be exercised by instructions or warrants under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet, or may be delegated to the Governor by letters patent under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom; and such instructions, warrants, or letters patent may be issued before this Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands.

33. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, from time to time, on address from the Legislative Body of any of the West Indian Islands not included in this Act and from the Council, to bring such island under the operation of this Act, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed, and as Her Majesty thinks fit to approve, and the provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Imperial Parliament.

ANTIGUA.

An island situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 5'. It is about 54 miles in circumference.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English in 1632. In 1663, Charles II made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. Area of the island is 108 square miles. About £7,500 is annually spent in the support of Poor Houses, Hospitals, Board of Health, and for Medical Relief, Vaccination, &c. There are 14 places of worship belonging to the Church of England, 13 Moravian, 10 Wesleyan.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; and a Legislative Council consisting of 24 members, of which the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Solicitor-General, and Treasurer, are ex-officio members; 8 members nominated by the Crown and 12 elected members.

The qualifications for Members and Voters were fixed by an Act of 1852, and are as follows:

For Members.—An annual income of 66l. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of 200l. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of 26l. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or land of the value of 111l., or one acre of land and building value 222l., or tenant paying not less than 88l. per annum.

The Island is divided into eleven electoral districts. Of the 208 voters registered for the whole Island, 130 are registered for the City of St. John. The districts are as follows:

| City of St. John | Division of St. John |
|------------------|---------------------|
|                  | Dickenson's Bay and Five Islands |
|                  | Popeshead |
|                  | Division of Old Road |
|                  | Bermudian Valley |

|                  | Willoughby Bay |
|                  | Division of Falmouth and Rendezvous Bay, and Towns Falmouth and English Harbour |

Members.

The Governor appoints the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Council, who in the event of an equality of votes shall have a second or casting vote. All grants or appropriations of money must originate with the Government Members. The duration of the Council is for five years. The elected members of the Legislative Council of Antigua send four elected members to the General Legislature.
