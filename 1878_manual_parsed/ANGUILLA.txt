ANGUILLA.

The island of Anguilla is placed under the Presidency of St. Christopher, being governed locally by a stipendiary magistrate, paid from the Imperial Treasury. This officer is assisted by a Vestry, of which he is chairman. The Vestry is composed of the stipendiary magistrate, three elected members, and three nominated by the Crown.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at 555l., and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. But the island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,500, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock, which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, a duty on salt, a tax upon houses and lands, licences, &c.

Presiding Magistrate, J. L. Lake, 220l.
