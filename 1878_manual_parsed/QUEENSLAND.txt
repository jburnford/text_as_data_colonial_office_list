QUEENSLAND.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point of the east coast called Point Danger, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, in lat. 28° 8' South.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the colony of Queensland comprises 669,520 square miles, or 428,492,800 acres.

Physical Features and Products.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good sized vessels.

A mountain range extends north and south throughout the greater part of the whole length of the country, running generally nearly parallel with the coast at an average distance of about 50 miles from it. Between the range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrow-root, and semi-tropical fruits.

Cotton cultivation promised for some years to prove remunerative to cottier-farmers, but since the discontinuance of the land bonuses given by the Government for its production, and the fall in prices consequent upon the renewed supply from the United States of America it has rapidly declined.

The sugar cane has been successfully grown on the eastern seaboard, and the production of sugar increased from the first year of its successful cultivation in 1867, to 12,108 tons in 1874. The quantity returned as made within the Colony in 1876, however, is only 8,214 tons.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated most successfully in the neighbourhood of Warwick, on the Darling Downs. The statistical register shows the quantity of wheat returned as produced in the year 1876 as 100,811 bushels.

Agricultural and other Industry.

Agriculture, in Queensland, is yet in its infancy, but is gradually extending and will no doubt continue to grow in importance with the rapid increase of population.

The pastoral occupation of the country is far in advance of agricultural settlement in the Colony, and from natural adaptation of soil and climate generally, and the great extent of the territory, this will no doubt continue to be the case.

There are 4,798 squatting "runs" or tracts of land leased from the Government at a very low annual rental in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

In 1876 there were 304 new runs applied for, containing together 17,555 square miles, or 12,940,800 acres. Application was made in the same year for 265 "unwatered runs," as they are termed, containing 16,282 square miles.

There were 142 runs purchased at auction during the year from the Government for 5,633l. 11s., at an average of 1l. 1s. 3d. per square mile. Together, the new runs acquired during the year were 708.

The average rate of rent per square mile on the available area of runs in what are called the unsettled districts of the country is 994 of a farthing per acre.

The importance of the pastoral interests will be seen by the value of the following exports connected with this industry for the year 1876:

| Item          | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Wool          | £1,499,576 |
| Hides and skins | 79,608 |
| Tallow        | 67,311 |
| Live stock    | 157,207 |

Total . . . £1,803,702

Mining is likely to prove the greatest source of wealth to the Colony. During the year 1876 the exports of gold and other metals are given as follows:

| Metal | Value   |
|-------|---------|
| Gold  | £1,427,929 |
| Tin   | 187,201 |
| Copper| 172,382 |

Total . . . £1,787,512

The gold fields on the Palmer River, in the far north of the Colony, discovered in 1874, have already attracted a population returned in the census of May, 1876, as 9,215 persons. Cooktown, on the Endeavour River, which is the port for this district, during the short period since it was proclaimed a township, to end of 1875, has yielded in the Customs revenue and wharfage rates, 117,432l. 16s. 1d., and in land sales and fees 11,013l. 1s. 1d.

During the year 1875 new discoveries of very extensive and apparently very rich gold reefs have been made on the Hodgkinson River, a little to the south of the Palmer. A road from the sea coast, which it is said may be rendered practicable for drays, has been found to the Hodgkinson gold fields, a distance of about 70 miles, which thus connects it with one of the finest harbours on the seaboard, called Trinity Bay, of which the port has been named Cairns. A considerable amount of capital and enterprise are likely to be attracted to this new auriferous district, and suitable machinery will no doubt speedily be erected for
crushing the stone, which is said to be very rich in gold.

Considerable tracts of good pastoral country have also been found not far from the new route from Trinity Bay to the gold fields, in the same district, and in the western districts, on the Diamantina and Herbert Rivers.

Valuable timber of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland and ought to become a valuable export. Excellent coal has been found in some localities; and there are other natural productions promising to add to the wealth of the Colony, but requiring labour and capital for their development.

Population and other Statistics.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, is found by the returns of the census of May, 1876, to be 173,283 persons.

The population on the 30th June, 1877, was estimated to be 198,361 persons.

There are 199 places now returned as proclaimed towns or township reserves, in the Colony, fifteen of which are municipal towns, with an aggregate population of a little over 58,000 persons, and containing rateable property valued at 4,054,228l.

Of the imports for 1876, the total value is given as 3,126,559l.

There are 6 banks with 66 branches. The value of the coin with bullion is given as 754,270l.; deposits 3,091,681l.; note circulation 343,591l.

The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 12,904, the amount of deposits as 641,875l.

The railways in Queensland show 298 miles now in operation, the revenue being 173,722l. There are 216 miles of railway in course of construction.

The electric telegraph lines show, number of stations, 118; miles of line, 4,638; revenue 42,057l.; number of messages (for the year 1876), 479,073.

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, has a population of 20,645, resident within the municipal limits, and of 26,953 within the census district. The mean external shade temperature there is given as 70°. The heat is great in summer, but the atmosphere is dry and healthy. In the winter the climate is agreeable. The mortality over a period of ten years from 1867 to 1876, was 17-58 per 1,000.

Immigration.

The European immigration for the year 1876 was 5,827. The arrivals from China and Hong Kong numbered 6,650, and from the South Sea Islands, 1,726; 2,918 immigrants from Europe were introduced entirely at the expense of the Queensland Government.

The land order system of immigration, by means of which as many as 36,000 persons were introduced from Great Britain in the years 1861-1866, a large number of them paying their own passages and bringing a great deal of capital into the colony has been discontinued. It is supposed that the present liberal system of disposing of the public lands of the Colony ought to be a sufficient attraction to the better class of immigrants from Europe likely to engage in pastoral and agricultural pursuits.

Land.

The vacant Crown lands in Queensland are dealt with under the provisions of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876. This measure is a consolidation of previous Acts, and differs in some respects from the Act of 1868, which was in force for eight years. For instance, classification of land into three classes, viz., agricultural, first class pastoral, and second class pastoral, is done away with, and a new system introduced of declaring the upset price when the land is proclaimed open to selection. Land cannot be sold for less than 5s. per acre, and in the case of conditional selections, ten years are allowed to pay the purchase-money.

A selector may obtain by conditional purchase not more than 5,120 acres, and not less than 40 acres, but the Act provides that in any district the Government may limit by proclamation the maximum area that one selector can secure, provided that the maximum shall not be less than 640 acres. Selectors of conditional purchases must expend a sum equal to the upset price up to 10s. per acre on the land, but not more than 10s. per acre is required under any circumstances. In addition to expenditure, the selector must reside personally or keep a bailiff on the land during the currency of the ten years' lease. After proof of three years' residence from date of selection and fulfilment of the conditions of expenditure, a certificate may be issued to the selector, which enables him to transfer his interest in the selection, if he desires to do so, or to pay up the balance of purchase-money and obtain a deed of grant.

The annual payments on homestead selections are 6d. per acre for five years. The area that can be selected under the homestead clauses of the Act is 80 acres in homestead areas, and 160 acres outside these areas. The land may be secured in fee simple by the homestead selector after a personal residence of five years, and proof of improvements of the value of 10s. per acre being effected on the land.

In homestead areas the area which can be selected under conditional purchase is limited to 1,280 acres, and under homestead selection to 80 acres. The homestead areas usually comprise land of the best class, and most suitable for settlement. All persons selecting in homestead areas must reside personally; the residence of bailiffs is not sufficient to entitle the selector to a deed of grant.

Pastoral runs in the unsettled districts of the Colony are leased for 21 years, in blocks of not less than 25 square miles, at a rental of 5s. per square mile for the first seven years, 10s. for the next seven and 15s. for the third seven years, the conditions being the stocking of the land with sheep or cattle equal to one-fourth of its carrying capacity, which is defined by the Pastoral Leases Act of 1869 to be 100 sheep or 20 head of cattle per square mile.

The several Acts of Parliament under which land may be secured are "The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876," "The Settled Districts Pastoral Leases Act of 1876," "The Pastoral Leases Act of 1869," "The Mineral Lands Act of 1872," and "The Gold Fields Act of 1874."

"The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868" was repealed on the 31st of March, 1876. Under its provisions, 4,658,251 acres were selected. There were 11,682 selections made under the Act; of these 3,036 were homesteads containing areas not exceeding 160 acres, 1,088 homesteads under the Homestead Areas Act of 1872 (now repealed), 7,228 conditional purchases, and 510 pre-emptions.

There are 32 land offices in the Colony, where conditional purchases and homesteads may be applied for.

The areas open to selection in the several settled
districts of the Colony in April, 1877, were as follows:

Lands open to selection at time of repeal of Act of 1868:

| Acres |
|-------|
| Conditional selection | 29,489,486 |
| Homestead areas | 597,325 |
| Town reserves | 388,160 |

Total: 30,484,941

Lands proclaimed open under the Act of 1876:

| Acres |
|-------|
| Conditional selection | 1,902,010 |
| Homestead areas | 838,860 |

Total: 2,735,866

Acres 33,220,801

Under "The Western Railway Act of 1875," a reserve containing 13,440,000 acres was set apart in which blocks of land containing about 5,000 acres, or in cases where improvements had been effected on the land, in blocks of 10,000 acres, may be sold to defray the cost of the railway which is in course of construction to Roma. The first sale under this Act was held in March, 1877, when the proceeds realised 136,405l.

"The Railway Reserves Act of 1877" also establishes four railway reserves in addition to the Western Railway reserve; it embodies the same provisions as "The Western Railway Act," viz., that the proceeds of the land in the several railway reserves are to be devoted to the construction of railways. There are four lines projected under this measure: 1st. An extension from Warwick to the northern border of New South Wales, through Stanthorpe, the principal town in the tin field; this line will be ultimately connected with the railway system of New South Wales. 2nd. The line from Maryborough to Gympie, one of the chief gold fields in the Colony. 3rd. The line from Bundaberg, a town at the mouth of the Burnett river to Tenningering, or Mount Perry, near which there are several rich copper mines. 4th. The line from Townsville to Charles Towers, one of the northern gold fields.

Government.

The Government of Queensland is composed of the Governor, appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, and an Executive Council, composed of the responsible ministers of the Crown. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected by the suffrages of the people. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The franchise is on the most liberal footing, every man of 21 years, who has resided as much as six months in one locality, having a vote. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in any district in which such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 28 members, including the President of the Council. The Lower House has 48 members, each representing one electoral district. The most northerly district in the Colony, Somerset, is as yet unrepresented. It contains only 101 male adults, according to the census of May 1st, 1876, exclusive of Chinese and Polynesians, who are not possessed of the franchise. Queensland became a colony in 1869, the territory having been then separated from New South Wales.

St. Helena.

St. Helena, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of South Africa, 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. St. Helena is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad; its area 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres.

The capital is James Town, which is on the N.W. of the island. The climate is mild, and little variable; the thermometer ranging in summer between 68° and 72°, and in winter between 57° and 70°.

St. Helena was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1501. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was sighted by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. St. Helena was uninhabited till the Dutch became possessors of it. Captain Munden, of the English Navy, in 1673, took it from the Dutch, and soon afterwards the East India Company obtained a charter for its possession from Charles II., and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 1833, when it was finally handed over to the British Government.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers returning from India, &c., and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, those named in the former returns being, in fact, reshippments of imported goods, and the entire trade has, therefore, depended exclusively upon the large sums of money brought into circulation from the several sources above named. These have all been greatly diminished in recent years, in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal, the considerable reduction in the Imperial expenditure in the island, and the reduction of the squadron consequent on the cessation of the slave trade.

Efforts are now being made to create an export trade. Native-grown fibre prepared by steam machinery from the "Phormium tenax," is found to be of excellent quality; 110 bales were prepared and exported in 1876, and the cultivation of the plant is being extended. Superior coffee is also easily produced, but as yet there are only three or four small plantations. The position of the island is well suited for a whale fishery, and it is on this account the resort of a number of American whalers. The oil transhipped to the United States from these vessels at St. Helena, in 1876, amounted to 88,040l. The island had previously no share in this pursuit, but in the last year, oil to the value of 5,600l. was taken by vessels belonging to the port and transhipped to London.

The number of ships calling at the port of James Town for supplies in 1876, including steamers and ships of war, was 582.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.
The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council.
