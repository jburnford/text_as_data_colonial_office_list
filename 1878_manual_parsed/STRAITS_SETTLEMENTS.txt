STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament 29 & 30 Vict. c. 115.

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island about 27 miles long by 14 wide, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 16' north, and long. 103° 53' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the main land, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of newly acquired territory to the south of the Krean (vide infra).

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 120 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 24½ miles in breadth. The principal town, called Malacca, is 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

History.

Malacca is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving out the Portuguese. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken possession of by the English and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally fell into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should not again meddle with affairs or have any settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined, and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of no commercial importance, but possessing great undeveloped agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not reduced to mercantile subjection by the Dutch; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn declined in importance, as the greater part of the extensive Eastern trade centred at Singapore, and Penang came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Laroot, Kallang, Salengore, Junk Ceylon, the Settlement of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra, &c.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island as it is officially called, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Rajah of Kedah in 1785, with the proviso that the sum of 10,000 dols. be annually paid to the Rajah of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1798, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Rajah, now called Province Wellesley. It extends from the Muda River to the Krean River, a distance of 35 miles, containing in all 234 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, when compared with the neighbouring territories. The census of 1871 gives a population of 71,000, who are almost entirely engaged in agriculture, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and cocoa-nuts. In 1806 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one Government, Penang still remaining the seat of Government. In 1832 the seat of Government was transferred to Singapore.

Singapore was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Malayan princes. It was at first subordinate to Bencoolen in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlement.

The anarchy prevailing in some states of the Malayan Peninsula, and especially in Perak, has been for years a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders. In the beginning of 1874 steps were taken by Sir A. Clarke to remedy this state of things by stationing British residents in Perak and Salengore, and in the small state of Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration. With a view also of enabling the British Authorities to keep order in that part of the Peninsula, a strip of land south of Province Wellesley, about 10 miles broad, beyond the Krean river, has been acquired as British Territory, as well as a small portion of territory on the mainland, opposite the island of Pulo Dinding.

Towards the end of 1875 disturbances arose in the States in question, Mr. Birch, the British Resident at Perak, was murdered, a force sent to apprehend the murderers was resisted; and, at the same time the Residency in Sungei Ujong was menaced by bodies of Malays from some of the States near Malacca.

Under the prompt and energetic measures taken by the Governor, Sir W. Jervois, these outbreaks were suppressed in the course of about two months. Troops were obtained from India and China, a
naval brigade was landed, and a native contingent organized. The forces in Perak under Major-General Colborne and Captain Buller, R.N., occupied that State; a military and naval force under the direction of Colonel Anson, Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, and commanded by Colonel Hill, of the Ist Ghorkhas, and Captain Sterling, R.N., drove the enemy from a strong fortified position in Sungei Ujong, and dispersed the malcontents in that quarter. During these operations, Salengore remained tolerably quiet.

Since the military occupation of Perak steps have been taken to effect the capture of the murderers of Mr. Birch. The good offices of the Siamese Government, and of the Maharajah of Johore and Rajah of Quedah, as well as of the chiefs of states adjacent to Perak, were enlisted by the Governor in support of other active measures adopted by him for this object; the murderers have either surrendered or been captured, four of them have been hanged, and four sentenced to penal servitude. The chiefs of Perak charged with instigating the murder of Mr. Birch have been deported to the Seychelles, and the principal chiefs concerned in the Sungei Ujong outbreak have also surrendered, and their disputes have been settled.

Government.

The government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council; the latter body comprising 11 official members and 6 unofficial nominated members.

The Military Force consists of one company of Royal Artillery and one Battalion of an Infantry Regiment, of which one Company is stationed at Malacca, two Companies and a few Artillery at Penang, and the remainder at Singapore. The recent disturbances have occasioned a temporary increase in this force.

Population.

In Penang and Province Wellesley, the Malay race predominates. The Chinese rank next, and constitute about a fourth of the whole population; the remainder being made up of Europeans and their descendants, natives of the Madras and Coromandel coasts (called Chulias and Klinges), Burmese, Siamese, and Bengalese.

In Malacca the Malays form a still larger proportion of the population, their numbers amounting to more than three-fourths of the whole. Here also the Chinese are found in great numbers, forming about a sixth of the inhabitants, Europeans and their descendants, native born Portuguese, natives of India and Arabs, making up the rest.

The population of Singapore is more varied in its composition, the Chinese being by far the most numerous section of the inhabitants.

The census of 1871 is considered to be far from correct in point of Chinese population, as they were unwilling to give correct returns, fearing that a poll-tax would follow the census, and it is estimated that 20 per cent. might be added to the census; the result of the census returns is as follows:

| Location       | Population |
|----------------|------------|
| Singapore      | 97,131     |
| Penang and Prov. Wellesley | 133,064   |
| Malacca        | 77,756     |
| **Total**      | **307,951** |

The following are the chief statistics of the census:

| Location       | Europeans | Malays | Chinese | Natives of India |
|----------------|-----------|--------|---------|------------------|
| Singapore      | 904       | 19,250 | 54,120  | 13,300           |
| Penang         | 513       | 20,110 | 22,720  | 7,100            |
| Prov. Wellesley| 96        | 51,100 | 14,000  | 10,000           |
| Malacca        | 47        | 57,474 | 13,456  | 3,000            |

The result of the census in previous years was as follows:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1838 | 150,000    |
| 1846 | 195,000    |
| 1856 | 248,000    |
| 1866 | 273,000    |
| 1871 | 307,951    |

Trade.

The Straits ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping entering the port is liable, consists of a very moderate one, of 3 cents or 1½d. per register ton, in support of the Horsburgh and Raffles Lighthouses at the eastern and western entrances to the roads of Singapore, a light on the north sands about the middle of the Straits of Malacca, and another at Cape Rachado.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmegs, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, &c. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in our own territories are gambier and pepper (in Singapore); tapioca (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); rice (in Prov. Wellesley and Malacca), and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). In the Province an attempt has recently been made with some success to cultivate the tea-plant.

The united exports and imports of the three Colonies in 1859-60 were as follows:

| Colony       | Exports/Imports |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Singapore    | £10,371,300     |
| Penang       | 3,530,000       |
| Malacca      | 920,000         |
| **Total**    | **£14,821,300** |

In 1876 they had increased to—

| Colony       | Exports/Imports |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Singapore    | £18,292,180     |
| Penang       | 6,895,923       |
| Malacca      | 949,371         |
| **Total**    | **£26,137,474** |

Number and tonnage of vessels which have arrived at the Straits Settlements in the three last years were as follows:

| Year | No. | Tonnage |
|------|-----|---------|
| 1873 | 8,761 | 1,675,984 |
| 1874 | 8,761 | 1,853,507 |
| 1875 | 10,473 | 2,204,875 |
| 1876 | 10,166 | 2,548,722 |

Finance.

The sources from which the revenue is raised are alike in all the three stations. They consist chiefly of a stamp duty, of the monopolies of preparing and retailing opium for smoking, and of the sale of spirits and other excisable commodities, which are farmed out to private individuals: The land revenue comprises the proceeds of sales of public lands, quit rents, tenths, and fees on transfer. Judicial fines and fees, the post office, the light-dues and a few miscellaneous items, make up the remaining sources of revenue.

| Revenue | Expenditure |

| 1868    | 276,642     | 254,391     |
| 1874    | 309,991     | 317,726     |
