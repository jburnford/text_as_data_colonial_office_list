**MALTA**

Malta is an island in the Mediterranean Sea about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. Valletta, its port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is about 95 square miles; that of Gozo 20 square miles.

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino mention is made at very early date. They were under the dominion of the Carthaginians, from whom they were taken in the first Punic War by the Romans. On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell to the Goths, and then to the Saracens. It was under the dominion of the Sicilians from 1190 until early in the sixteenth century, when it was granted by the Roman Emperor Charles V, to the Order of the Knights of St. John, by whom it was held for more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, Malta capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte. The Maltese rose, however, against their conquerors, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they closely blockaded them for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered, and Malta was taken pos-
session of by Great Britain 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris 1814.

The climate of Malta is somewhat peculiar. The heat there almost equals that experienced in the tropics, and lasts not only during the day, but continues almost without abatement through the night. This continuous heat for some months of the year produces a feeling amongst the residents of lassitude and oppression. The maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 61° Fahr., and the minimum 58°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is 82° Fahr., and the minimum 73°. The well-known "scirocco" is a very disagreeable wind, blowing from the south-east; it is particularly prevalent in the autumn of the year.

The island is highly cultivated; its principal products are cotton and corn; the vine has been grown, and oranges and figs are abundant.

In July, 1874, the rate of mortality, as indicated by the mortuary returns, had so alarmingly increased, that the Government, desirous that the causes should be examined, and information as to the nature and actual extent of the mischief placed on record, directed that a commission, composed of members of the medical profession, should report upon the question. The commission, six months after their appointment, made a full report on the sanitary state of Malta and Gozo, and attributed its insanitary state to the following causes:

1. The condition of the inhabitants in regard to the defective state of the actual system of sewage and drainage.
2. Poverty, and the habitual use of food amongst the labouring classes wanting in nutrient principles.
3. Intra-mural burials, which, though forbidden in the towns, are still permitted in the interior of churches in the villages.
4. Early and improvident marriages, to prevent which it would be most desirable that the great influence of the priesthood should be brought to bear with a view of discouragement.
5. Ignorance, causing, amongst other things, an excessive rate of infant mortality.
6. With regard to the sewage and drainage improvement scheme, nothing was done in 1874, but there is every reason to hope that these important sanitary works will not be any longer delayed, and that the outfall tunnel and intercepting sewers will be commenced at once in the three cities, when the remaining supplementary works will eventually follow. With regard to the other insanitary conditions above mentioned—those of overcrowding and poverty—emigration has been suggested as the fittest remedy. The industry, intelligence, and frugality of the Maltese render them acceptable immigrants.

During the year 1874, the great work begun by the late Sir Gaspard Le Marchant, namely, the extension of Malta Great Harbour, was finally completed, and the French Creek handed over to the Admiralty authorities, whilst the merchant shipping was moved into the newly-extended waters of the Marsa.

Malta is connected with the undermentioned ports in the manner now stated:

Gibraltar and England by the P. & O. steamers, once a week.
Sicily and Italy by Florio's steamers, twice a week (Tuesday and Friday).
Marseilles by the French steamers, twice a month (say 4th and 18th of each month).
Port Said by the P. & O. steamers, once a week.
Alexandria by the French steamers, twice a month (say 4th and 18th of each month).
Tunis and Marseilles by Messrs. Rubattino's steamers, once a week.
Tunis by Mr. Golcher's steamer "Lancetfield," once a week.
Tripoli by the Ottoman steamer "Trabulus Garb," say once a week, and by Messrs. Rubattino's steamers, also once a week.

The Government is administered by a Governor, who is assisted by a Council of Government, constituted by Letters Patent of 11th May, 1849, consisting of 18 members, 10 official, and 8 elected, who are returned by about 2,700 electors. The Governor is President. An income of £l. from immovable property, or payment of a rent of 4l. per annum qualifies a person to vote.
