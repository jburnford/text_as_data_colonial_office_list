Geographical Features
Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa, and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000–3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland, and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chilwa and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate
The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History
The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters, and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to “The Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa”; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to “The British Central Africa Protectorate” but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of “The Nyasaland Protectorate.” The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.
There were internal disturbances in 1915, known as the Chilembwe Rising, when an African pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges; and in 1953 disturbances in the Southern Province, attributed in large part to discontent over the African tenant system obtaining in privately-held estate land, resulted in the deaths of 12 Africans. In both cases rapid and successful countermeasures were taken.

In March 1959 following a number of disturbances throughout the country, a state of emergency was declared, and serious riots subsequently took place, particularly in the Northern Province. Reinforcements of troops and police were brought in from neighbouring territories and order was quickly restored.

The state of emergency was lifted in June 1960.

**Constitution**

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 131). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council and a Legislative Council whose present membership is shown on page 143.

Under the terms of recommendations put forward by the Nyasaland Constitutional Conference which was held in London in July and August 1960 the Governor will preside over an Executive Council of ten members of whom five will be officials (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary and two nominated official members); the five unofficial Ministers will include three chosen from among the members of Legislative Council elected on the lower of the two proposed electoral rolls and two from among those elected on the higher electoral roll. All appointments to the Council will carry Ministerial status although one or more of the unofficial Ministers may be nominated as Ministers without Portfolio.

The Governor will have power to appoint up to three Parliamentary Secretaries from among the elected members of the Legislative Council, at least two being selected from members elected on the lower electoral roll.

The new Legislative Council will consist of 28 elected unofficial members and the five official members of the Executive Council. The 28 unofficial members will be elected in single member geographical constituencies on a two tier qualitative franchise containing members of all races. Twenty of these will be elected in one set of constituencies by voters who satisfy lower qualifications and eight in another set of constituencies by voters who satisfy higher qualifications.

**Land Policy** is controlled so far as African Trust Land, which comprises 87% of the total area of the Protectorate, is concerned, by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Orders in Council, 1950 and 1955. Under these Orders in Council Africans may use and occupy African Trust Land not held under lease in accordance with the African law and custom prevailing in the area. The Orders in Council empower the Governor at his discretion to lease trust land for terms up to 99 years, while the Secretary of State's sanction is required for the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is either held in private ownership or is public land, which includes areas of state forest; the disposal of public land is controlled by the Public Land Ordinance, 1951, which empowers the Governor to make grants, leases or other dispositions subject to the provisions of any Order in Council or any general or special instruction of the Secretary of State.

**Taxation**

A Poll Tax is payable by non-African males over 18 years of age, resident in the Protectorate, at the rate of £4 per annum. An African Tax is payable by all male Africans over 18 years of age. The rate with effect from the 1st January, 1958, is 30s. per annum. Both the African and non-African Poll Tax can be set off against any Territorial surcharge paid by the individual concerned.

Income Tax and Customs and Excise duties are assessed and collected by the Federal Government, which took over direct responsibility for them on the 1st April 1954.

Rates of Income Tax (1957–58) rise from 9d. in the £ on the first £500 of chargeable income to 6s. 3d. in the £ in excess of £2,500 for married persons. There are primary rebates of £37 10s. and £25 respectively for married and single persons, and rebates for children, dependants, blind persons and food farmers and in respect of insurance premiums and benefit fund contributions. Companies pay tax at 6s. 3d. in the £.

Supertax is levied (after an allowance of £3,000 for married persons and £2,000 for single persons and companies) on taxable income plus dividends received by residents of the Federation from all sources. Non-residents of the Federation are not liable to supertax on dividends received from companies incorporated in the Federation unless they carry on business there. Certain external companies as defined in the income tax law are also subject to supertax.

A tax is levied on the undistributed profits of private companies as defined in the income tax law, at the rate of 1s. 6d. in the £ on the first £2,000 of the undistributed profits and at the rate of 3s. in the £ on the remainder.

On all tax payable a surcharge is raised by the Territorial Government amounting to 20 per cent. of the Federal tax payable by both persons and companies.

In 1959–60, £2,041,478 revenue was received from the Federal Government, under certain constitutional provisions, as the Nyasaland share of Federal Income Tax. Other main sources of revenue were: Taxes, Licences, etc., £1,372,812; Reimbursements from and services rendered to Federal Government £905,925.
In the same year the main heads of expenditure on Revenue Account were:

| Head                      | £       |

| Loan from Colonial Development Corporation         | 1,000,000 |

Currency

The Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was established in 1956 and issues the Federal currency. Southern Rhodesia currency continues also as legal tender for the present. United Kingdom coins ceased to be legal tender as from 1st January 1955.

Development Plan

The Nyasaland Capital Development Plan 1957–61 has been reviewed and extended for a further period of two years, but due to the many changes to which the plan is subject at the present time, a revised plan has not been published. Liaison is maintained with the other three Governments in the Federation. The following is a summary of the distribution of funds provided in the Estimates on Development Account, 1960–61:

| Head                                      | Per cent |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Administrative Buildings                   | 6        |
| Housing                                   | 5        |
| Roads and Bridges                         | 9        |
| Public Works Organization                  | 6        |
| Education and Social Welfare               | 7        |

| Natural Resources                         | 13       |
| Loans to Local Authorities and Direct Investment in Development of Urban areas | 28       |
| Rural Development                         | 6        |
| Miscellaneous                              | 1        |
| **Total**                                 | **100%** |

The current plan aims at a balanced programme of development of natural resources and urban services. A major project among the former is a scheme for land re-organization designed to introduce improved methods of land usage in selected areas. Included in the projects for urban development is the provision of funds for an entirely new water supply for Blantyre/Limbe. The programme for Education is being intensified, with particular emphasis upon teacher training and secondary education. With the help of a direct grant from the United Kingdom Government a programme of capital development is proceeding to provide buildings and equipment for an expanded Police Force for the closer administration of the Territory.

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

In 1959 there were seven European Primary Schools, three of which are private schools, catering for 1,214 pupils. There were 404 pupils receiving Secondary education. There are 18 Government Primary Schools with three Post-Primary classes up to Standard 7 serving 2,314 Asian and Coloured pupils, and a Secondary School for Asian and Coloured children will, it is hoped, be completed by 1961.

In 1959, 3,097 primary schools catered for 293,480 African pupils; 970 of these schools were grant-aided and staffed by qualified teachers, the balance were conducted by the various missionary bodies without assistance from public funds.

Two Government secondary schools at Dedza and Mzuzu had a total enrolment of 267. Two other full secondary schools and nine junior secondary schools, receiving assistance from public funds, provide accommodation for 860 pupils. Three unaided secondary schools had an enrolment of 173. In 1958 eight pupils from Nyasaland attended Higher School Certificate courses at schools in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia.

There are eight assisted and one unassisted Teacher Training Colleges, in addition to the Government Teacher Training College at Domasi. At these 918 students underwent teacher training in 1959.

An Artisan Training Centre conducted by the Department of Education, gave instruction to 130 pupils in 1958. The Government also assisted artisan training schemes at missions, and technical and vocational training was given at a number of unaided schools.

Expenditure on Education in the year 1959 was just under £907,686.

Libraries

Public libraries exist at Blantyre for both Africans and Europeans, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at the three secondary schools, and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of subjects and makes these available to study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health

Public Health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

The principal diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread. Epidemics of smallpox rarely now occur. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, reappeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952, but again subsided.

There is 1 Central Hospital, 1 General Hospital, 14 District Hospitals, 5 Rural Hospitals, and 2 Special Hospitals—1 Mental and 1 Leprosy—with accommodation for 280 and 458 persons respectively.
Each Hospital has a number of satellite health centres of which there are 106.

There are beds for Europeans and Asians in the Central Hospital, the General Hospital and one of the District Hospitals.

Mission Hospitals provide 1,549 beds, inclusive of maternity beds.

In 1959 the total admissions and out-patient attendances for Europeans, Asians and Coloureds, and Africans were as follows:

| In-patients | Out-patients |
|-------------|--------------|
| Europeans   | 1,314        |
| Asians and Coloureds | 883         |
| Africans    | 61,721       |
|             | 1,681,878    |

Expenditure on health services during the 1959–60 financial year was £907,720.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial roads and other aspects of communications.

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and 12 out-station airfields at eight of which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Federal Director of Meteorological Services, and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre, Lilongwe and Mzimba. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation, and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways and East African Airways each operate a weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 289 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Province. At Chipoka, south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. From January to September 1959, 712,900 tons of freight and 404,369 passengers were carried.

The total road mileage is 5,988, of which just over 249 miles have a bituminous carpet.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing eight vessels. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

Monkey Bay–Chipoka–KotaKota–Likoma Island–Chintete–Nkata Bay–Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika)–Ruarwe–Florence Bay–Deep Bay–Manda (Tanganyika)–Ngara–Kaporor (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

Broadcasting

African broadcasting programmes are received in Nyasaland from the Central African Broadcasting Station in Lusaka. There are no wired broadcasting centres.

Nyasaland has no immediate access to the air, and broadcasting material for transmission to the African community is telegraphed or airmailed on tape to Lusaka. The Chinyanja programmes, specially directed at the African population of Nyasaland, have in the past been compiled from material recorded by visiting teams of broadcasters from Lusaka. With the introduction of the two-channel broadcasting system at Lusaka in 1957 the time allocated to Nyasaland each week was extended to seven hours. The supply of programmes for this number of hours could not be maintained on the old basis of periodical tours, and permanent staff have been posted to Zomba to open the recording studio and to ensure a regular flow of Nyasaland material for broadcasting from Lusaka. The recording studio is fully equipped with tape-recording facilities and the live material prepared includes talks, feature broadcasts, music and plays.

It is estimated that there are over 12,000 cheap “saucepan” and dry-battery sets in the Protectorate in addition to the 4,000 sets registered with the Postmaster-General.

The Principal Occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and tea industries, retail trading.

On 31st December 1959 there were four employees’ trade unions with a paid-up membership of 3,528 and five associations of employers.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize, millet, cassava, groundnuts, tea, tobacco, rice, cotton, tung-oil, and miscellaneous pulses.

Timber production in 1959 (excluding private land) was 2,376,797 cubic feet, of which hardwood amounted to 2,233,499 cubic feet and softwood 143,298 cubic feet. Included in the total production was 159,456 cubic feet of poles, and 1,926,604 cubic feet of firewood.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa and commercial enterprises are in process of development; fishery research is being undertaken.

No minerals were exported on a commercial scale during 1959, although samples of various minerals were sent out of the country for analysis.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of soap, cigarettes, and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of exports and imports.

| Year | Imports* | Re-exports | Exports |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| 1938 | 833,324  | 14,919     | 959,810 |
| 1955 | 6,986,179| 69,363     | 7,033,503|
| 1956 | 8,105,667| 51,664     | 8,274,739|
| 1957 | 9,030,930| 35,597     | 8,658,487|
| 1958 | 7,614,824| 103,482    | 5,755,948|
| 1959 | 5,550,651| 79,235     | 6,430,482|

* Including Government imports but not bullion and specie.

Statistics are not now available of certain commodities and products which are exported from Nyasaland but disposed of or processed
within the Federation. The figures given from 1956 are therefore those of crops or products originating from Nyasaland which were exported to countries outside the Federation.

The chief imports are fibres, yarns, textiles and apparel; metals, machinery, vehicles and metal manufactures; oils, resins, waxes, paints, varnishes; foodstuffs.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The marketing of the principal cash crops grown on African trust land, namely, tobacco, cotton, maize and groundnuts, is handled by a statutory board whose aim is to ensure a steady price to the producer, as near as possible to world prices, and to secure improvement of the quality of the product. The board helps to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of contributions from surpluses to the African Development and Welfare Fund. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom and other extraterritorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1959 there were 81 primary and 6 secondary co-operative societies, with 7,763 members and 61 member societies respectively. The main products handled are rice, coffee and ghee.
