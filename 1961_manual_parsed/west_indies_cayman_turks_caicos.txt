Turks and Caicos Islands

Area

The Turks Islands Bank and the Caicos Bank cover an area of approximately 75 by 50 miles to the south-east of the Bahama Islands. The total land area is estimated at 166 square miles.

Population

The total population at the 1960 Census was 5,985.

Principal Towns

The towns and largest settlement are Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour (South Caicos) and Bottle Creek (North Caicos), with populations of 2,139, 851 and 1,071 respectively.

Geographical Features

The Turks Islands consist of two inhabited islands, Grand Turk and Salt Cay, six uninhabited cays, and a large number of rocks. The principal islands of the Caicos group are South Caicos, East Caicos, Middle (or Grand) Caicos, North Caicos, Providenciales and West Caicos. Geographically the islands are a part of the Bahama chain and have the same flat characteristics, there being no land above 250 feet. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by a 20-mile stretch of ocean water known as the Turks Islands passage; the Caicos Islands are surrounded by a shallow water reef. The islands generally are arid and stony.

Climate

The south-east trade winds blow constantly throughout the year, giving an equable and healthy climate. Rainfall is variable and tends to be higher in the Caicos Islands; on Grand Turk the annual average is about 25 inches. The temperature ranges throughout the year from 60° to 90°. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1908, 1926, 1928, 1945 and 1960.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable and Wireless Limited at Grand Turk.

History

The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the Southern States of America after the War of Independence. After the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, their former slaves remaining in possession. In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, but in 1848 a separate charter was granted to the islands divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas. After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 petitioned Her Majesty that the islands might be annexed to the Colony of Jamaica and from 1874 to July 1959 they were one of its dependencies.

An Order in Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica made provision for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Elections, based on adult suffrage, were held for the unofficial seats for the first time in 1953. The Commissioner was ex officio President of the Board, which had full legislative and budgetary powers, but ordinances required the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming law. Laws passed by the Legislature of Jamaica did not apply to the Dependency unless they were made applicable in express terms. The revenues and expenditure are independent of those of Jamaica.

On the 20th February 1958 the Royal Assent was given to the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands Act, 1958, by which Her Majesty was empowered to make provision by Order in Council for the government of the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands.

In 1953 the United States Government completed a Guided Missile Observer Station at Grand Turk, under an extension of the Bahamas Agreement.

A United States Government Naval Facility for Oceanographic Measurement was established at Grand Turk in 1954.

Constitution

The Turks and Caicos Islands (Constitution Order in Council, 1959, provides for the new constitution which was brought into operati
on the 4th July 1959. Under it the office of Governor of the Islands was constituted (the Governor of Jamaica is also Governor of the Islands) and the office of Commissioner replaced by the office of Administrator. The former Legislative Board was replaced by a Legislative Assembly consisting of the Administrator as President, two or three official members appointed by the Governor, two or three nominated non-official members appointed by the Governor, and nine members elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage; and an Executive Council was introduced consisting of the Administrator when the Governor is present and presiding, two official members, one nominated member and two elected members (elected by the nominated and elected members of the Assembly from among the elected members of the Assembly).

The Legislature of Jamaica has power to make laws for the Turks and Caicos Islands, provided that no Jamaican Law applies in the Islands unless:

(i) it is in express terms made applicable thereto, and

(ii) the Governor declares by Proclamation that the particular Law shall apply to the Turks and Caicos Islands, with such modifications as he may specify.

**Land Policy**

Much of the land on the salt islands (South Caicos, Salt Cay and Grand Turk) is held on private freehold title. The law limiting the rights of aliens to own land was repealed in 1953.

**Taxation**

The main heads of taxation are Customs import duties (15% preferential and 20% general f.o.b.) and a special tax of 4% on all dutiable goods. There is no direct taxation.

**Public Finance**

| Year       | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

(a) The Revenue 1959 includes £85,400 grant-in-aid from Her Majesty’s Government, and £23,236 C.D. and W. grants.

The main source of local revenue in 1959 was £41,109 from Customs. The main heads of expenditure in the same year were:—Administrator’s Department £19,031, Medical Department £13,285, Education £12,782, Unemployment Relief £16,694.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is Jamaica notes and British silver of all denominations.

**Development Plans**

The Islands have received an allocation of £60,000 under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act. Plans for the development of the salt industry will take approximately half this amount. A further sum of £30,000 allocated to the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands has been held back against future requirements.

**Education**

There are 13 Government Elementary Schools in the Islands. The one at Grand Turk has a Senior Section. In 1959 there were some 1,241 pupils on the rolls and the average attendance was 924. Expenditure on education during 1959 amounted to £12,844 compared with £840 in 1935.

**Libraries**

There is a public library at Grand Turk.

**Health**

There is a 16-bed cottage hospital of modern design at Grand Turk, together with a dental clinic. Medical officers, seconded from Jamaica, are stationed at Grand Turk and at Cockburn Harbour on South Caicos. There is a clinic at Cockburn Harbour, a maternity clinic in the charge of a midwife at Bottle Creek on North Caicos, and a district midwife at Salt Cay. Expenditure on medical services in 1959 was £14,166, compared with £990 in 1935. Half the salaries of all trained staff is now contributed by the Jamaica Government. The Jamaica Government also pays for all drugs used for the year in excess of £1,000. Plans are afoot for the installation of an X-ray unit at the Grand Turk Hospital.

**Communications**

There are airfields at Grand Turk and South Caicos. The former is a military airstrip constructed by the United States Government in connexion with the Guided Missile Project. A weekly air service with Nassau was begun in 1956. There is a fortnightly mail, freight and passenger service to Jamaica by sea and ships call occasionally from England and the United States.

Grand Turk is an important junction of cables to Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda. A radio telephone system connects Grand Turk with Salt Cay and the Caicos Islands as well as providing a service with Jamaica and the United States.

There is no broadcasting service but Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited broadcast a five-minute daily programme of news and announcements.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population of the Turks Islands group and of South Caicos are normally engaged in the production (by solar evaporation) and the shipping of salt. A grant of £35,200 was made from Colonial Development and Welfare funds during 1958 to provide modern loading facilities. The remainder of the Caicos population are mainly fishermen, and do a limited amount of subsistence agriculture. A large proportion of the male population is usually absent from home working in the Bahamas lumber camps, the Inagua salt works or as crews on merchant ships.

**Main Crops and Products**

Sisal is grown under conditions of peasant agriculture in the Caicos Islands, but the quality is poor, owing to the absence of fresh water for retting and washing. Salt is the main product of the Colony. Crawfish are exported frozen to Florida, and conchs are sold dried to Haiti.

Of these, three Ministers are appointed from the elected members of the Legislative Council and the other unofficial member is appointed from either the elected or the Nominated members of the Legislative Council. As in Antigua, the unofficial member of the Executive Council who has not a Ministerial portfolio will continue, until the next general election, to be a Nominated member of the Legislative Council appointed by the Administrator in his discretion.

(ii) The present composition of the Legislative Council is the Administrator, two official members, two nominated members, and five elected members.

(iii) Under the new provisions the Legislative Council will be composed of the Administrator, who will preside, two official members, one Nominated unofficial member, and seven elected members.

**Taxation**

The following forms of direct taxation are in force:

- Income Tax (ranging from 6d. to 15s. per £ of chargeable income; companies 6s. 8d. per £ of chargeable income).
- Land and House Tax.

St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla

Area and Geographical Features
The total area of the Colony is 138 square miles (St. Kitts 65, Nevis 36, Anguilla 35 and Sombrero 2 square miles). St. Kitts has a range of lofty mountains traversing its central part (Mount Misery 3,711 feet). Nevis is nearly circular in shape with a central mountain rising to 3,596 feet. Both islands are of volcanic origin. Anguilla is flat and composed of oligocene limestone and clay. Sombrero is a rocky islet. Hot mineral springs with valuable medicinal properties are to be found near Charlestown, Nevis.

Population
The preliminary figure of population at the 1960 Census was 56,644.

The Principal Towns are Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts, with a population of approximately 15,742, and Charlestown and its environs, the capital of Nevis, with a population of approximately 2,850.

History
St. Christopher, discovered by Columbus on his second voyage in 1493, was the first island in the West Indies to be colonized by the English, when Sir Thomas Warner took settlers there in 1623. In 1624 the French, under d'Esambuc, also colonized one-half of the island.

After a severe battle with the Europeans in about 1626, the Caribs, the native people of the island, were driven out in 1629.

Intermittent warfare between the French and British settlers during the seventeenth century ravaged the economy of the island. It was, however, ceded to Britain by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The last fighting on the island took place in 1782 when the French captured Brimstone Hill after a memorable siege, and once more took possession of St. Christopher. The island was finally restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

Nevis, also sighted by Columbus on his second voyage, was settled by the English in 1628 and soon became one of the most prosperous of the Antilles. Although it suffered from French and Spanish attacks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it maintained a sound economic position until the middle of the nineteenth century.

Columbus probably also first sighted Anguilla. The island remained continuously British after its colonization in 1650 but was subject in its early days to severe depredations by marauders, free-booters and pirates.

Constitution
The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua—see page 185—except that there is a separate Police Force. The Administrator appoints the Head of the Force in his discretion, and the gazetted ranks after consulting the Police Service Commission.

Land Policy
Aliens cannot own land except under licence from the Governor.

Taxation
The main taxes in force are Customs duty and Income tax. Income tax rates range from 6d. in the £ to 15s. in the £ upon the chargeable income of an individual. Companies pay a flat rate of 8s. in the £.

There are also a tuberculosis ward and a leprosarium.

Communications

One airport, about two miles north of Basseterre by road, serves the island of St. Kitts. The runway is 4,125 feet by 300 feet and lies in a west-east direction. This is being extended and a new terminal building and control tower are being constructed.

There are landing strips with terminal buildings in Nevis and Anguilla. The air service to these islands is operated by L.I.A.T., a subsidiary of B.W.I.A.

Under a Colonial Development and Welfare grant a new passenger service vessel was built in British Guiana for daily voyages between St. Kitts and Nevis, and put into operation in 1959. It replaces the one destroyed by hurricane in 1956.

Principal Towns

| Population |
|------------|
| Castries   | 17,505 |
| Soufrière  | 2,723  |
| Vieux Fort | 3,226  |

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, with magnificent scenery. The highest peak is Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet); the most spectacular are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September–October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

History

Neither the date of discovery, nor the discoverer, of St. Lucia is known, for according to the evidence of Columbus's voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June 1803 was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua—see page 185.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 8d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

Under the Development Plans for 1960-64 presented to Federal Government in November 1959 and submitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in March 1960 against the Colonial Development and Welfare (Amendment) Act allocation of $4,320,000 to the Colony, provision is made both for the continuation of existing projects as well as several new items.

The programme provides for expenditure in the following proportions:

- Administration: 2%
- Production: 52%
- Communications: 27%
- Social Affairs: 19%

Education

There are two Secondary Schools with 875 pupils on the roll, and 52 Primary Schools with a total of 19,410 pupils enrolled.

In the 1959-60 session there were 80 St. Lucia students at Universities in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and seven at the University College of the West Indies.

The total expenditure for 1959 was $662,113, compared with $32,122 in 1935.

Libraries

There is a Central Library in Castries and a branch library in Soufrière. Small branches are also maintained in the towns and villages.

Health

The most prevalent diseases are heart diseases, diseases of early infancy, tuberculosis, helminthic diseases, and venereal diseases.

Malaria has been virtually eradicated as a result of an Insect Control Campaign carried out with W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. assistance.

A five-year Environmental Sanitation Programme was started in 1959 with assistance from W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. The aim of the programme is to provide safe excreta disposal systems and water supplies in all rural areas of the Island.

Available hospital beds amount to 158 general, 50 tuberculosis, 140 in the mental hospital, and 120 in a home for the aged and infirm.

In 1958, hospital in-patients numbered 5,828, and 67,761 persons attended at clinics or health outposts.

The expenditure on medical and allied services in 1959 was $551,446, compared with $55,795 in 1935.

Communications

There are two airfields, the Vigie Airport, and the Beane Field Airport. Air services with the other islands are maintained by British West Indian Airways Incorporated, and chartered flights by K.L.M. and British Guiana Airways.

The total mileage of the island's road system is 399.

Cargo steamers of the Harrison Line, the Geest Industries Company and numerous inter-island craft are the main means of communication by sea. Castries handles about 1,000,000 gross tons of shipping annually.

St. Vincent

Area

The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population

The population at the 1960 (April) Census was 80,042.

Principal Town

Kingstown, the capital (proper), has a population of 4,296; Kingstown (suburbs) of 16,141.

Geographical Features

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufrière (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 70 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At Kingstown, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 81·5°, and the rainfall 83·91 inches, in 1959.

History

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent, and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British fourteen years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in 1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 185) except that provision is made for nine elected members in the next Legislative Council.

Taxation

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 65 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 37½ cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 18s. 2d. per proof gallon.

Development Plans

St. Vincent has been allocated the sum of £540,000 ($2,592,000) under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act. It is proposed that these funds should be used as follows in the 1960–64 period:

| Head                        | Amount   |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Agriculture, etc.           | £156,273 |
| Public Works                | £253,359 |
| Education                   | £82,100  |
| Medical                     | £31,000  |
| Urban and Rural Rehabilitation | £17,268 |

£540,000

Education

In 1959 there were two Government Secondary Schools and two grant-aided Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 911 pupils and 50 Primary Schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 20,295 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions. Three Government teacher-training establishments have a total enrolment of 176 pupils.

During 1958–59 some 45 St. Vincent students were attending Universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1959 expenditure on educational services amounted to $714,481. The contribution of the United Kingdom under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $117,640. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

Health

Of tropical diseases yaws, which was prevalent, has been almost eliminated. Two outbreaks occurred in 1959. Prompt measures were taken to prevent a further spread of the disease and constant vigilance is maintained. Tuberculosis is a major health problem (average deaths over a five-year period were 11·8 annually). Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 22 dispensaries. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery): 202
- Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases: 48
- Mental: 100
- Leprosy: 20
- Pauper Home: 125

In 1959 in-patients numbered 4,483; out-patients, 4,485.

Total expenditure in 1959 on Government Health and Medical Services was $676,821; in 1935, $66,945.

Communications

The Seadrome at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown, is no longer in use. An airstrip has been constructed at Arnos Vale, two miles outside Kingstown, and during 1960 the terminal building was under construction. British West Indian Airways and Leeward Islands Air Transport are operating services daily in and out of Arnos Vale Airport.

There are about 430 miles of road of which some 140 miles are motorable throughout the year; 120 miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 310 miles of metalled roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly cargo and passenger service is provided by two Federal ships travelling alternately via the islands as far north as Jamaica, and south to Trinidad. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service monthly by the Harrison Line. Geest Industries Steamships call weekly taking shipments of bananas to the United Kingdom. The Saguenay Line's steamships call southbound from Canada via the islands fortnightly, and return approximately every four weeks northbound. The Royal Netherlands Steamship Company operates a cargo service once monthly, northbound. Motor vessels and schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

Principal Occupations

The working population is estimated to be some 34,000, about 50% of whom are engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.

Trade Unions

| Trade Union                                      | Membership |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers' Union | 2,780      |
| The Civil Service Association                    | 80         |
| The Teachers' Association                         | 312        |
| The Secondary School Teachers' Association       | 27         |
| United Workers' Union                            | 415        |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops in order of importance are bananas, arrowroot, copra, sugar, cotton, sweet potatoes, nutmegs and mace, peanuts, starchy food crops, cocoa and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is: goats 12,000; cattle 7,000; sheep 14,000; horses and mules 200; swine 10,000.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

Extensive fishing is done in-shore but very little off-shore. A fisheries scheme has just been approved under which cold storage facilities will be provided. This, it is hoped, will lead to greatly increased activity particularly in the well stocked fishing waters of the Grenadines.

The one modern Central Arrowroot Factory is now operating. There are some 28 other privately owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a cigarette factory; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks. The Government Cotton Gininery was destroyed by fire in November 1959 and has not yet been rebuilt. There is a tyre recapping factory at Arnos Vale.
