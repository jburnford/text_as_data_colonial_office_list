FEDERATION OF NIGERIA

The Federation of Nigeria attained independence and membership of the Commonwealth on the 1st October 1960. The independent state is a constitutional monarchy and the same system of government is reproduced in the Regions. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is now the channel of communication between Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and Her Majesty’s Government in Nigeria.

Basic information about Nigeria will be found in the 1960 edition of the Colonial Office List.
