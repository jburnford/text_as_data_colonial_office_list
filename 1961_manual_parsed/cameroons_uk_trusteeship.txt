THE CAMEROONS UNDER UNITED KINGDOM TRUSTEESHIP

The Cameroons under United Kingdom Trusteeship was, from 1922 until 30th September 1960 administered as an integral part of Nigeria. At a plebiscite held in November 1959 the majority of the people in the Northern Cameroonos chose to defer the decision of their future until a later date. No plebiscite in the Southern Cameroonos was possible before Nigerian independence. The whole territory was then separated from Nigeria. Plebiscites were held on 11th February 1961, when the people of the Northern Cameroonos expressed their preference for attaining independence as part of independent Nigeria and the people of the Southern Cameroonos indicated their wish to become part of the independent Republic of the Cameroun.

A very full report on the territory is submitted each year to the Trusteeship Council. The Report for 1958 is published as Colonial No. 341.
