KINGDOM OF TONGA

Area
The total estimated area of the Tongan, or Friendly, Islands is 270 square miles, including inland waters. Tongatapu, the largest island, extends over 99·2 square miles.

Population
Population, as recorded in the 1956 Census, numbered 56,838, over 53,000 being Tongans. At the end of 1959 the population was estimated to be 61,899.

Principal Town
The administrative capital is Nuku'alofa on Tongatapu. Its population at the 1956 Census was 9,202.

Geographical Features
There are three main groups of islands: Vava'u, Ha'apai and Tongatapu. The islands on the eastern side are of coral formation while the chain on the west are volcanic. There are active volcanoes on four of the islands.

Climate
The climate is healthy, though hot and humid from January to March with temperatures of 90°; during the rest of the year it is pleasantly cool with temperatures as low as 52° on Tongatapu. The mean annual temperature is 73°; the mean annual rainfall is 70 inches on Tongatapu and 110 inches on Vava'u.

History
During the first half of the nineteenth century the islands were the scene of civil wars. These were finally checked during the reign of King George Tupou I (1845–93) who had by conquest gathered all power in his own hands.

In 1826 Wesleyan missionaries landed on Tonga and by the middle of the century practically all the chiefs and people had embraced Christianity. Not until the last decade of the century, however, were questions regarding freedom of worship and the relationship of Church and State peaceably settled. In 1900, by a Treaty of Friendship and Protection, Tonga became a British Protected State. On the 26th August, 1958, a new Treaty of Friendship was signed at Nuku'alofa, where it was ratified on the 25th May, 1959. This new Treaty reflects the changes which have occurred in the last half century. Tonga continues to be a State under British Protection but has increased local autonomy, and while in general external relations remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom, certain aspects of these relations will be conducted by the Government of Tonga.

Constitution
The present constitution is based, with relatively little amendment, on that granted in 1875 by King George Tupou I. It provides for a Government consisting of the Sovereign (at present Queen Salote Tupou, G.C.V.O., G.B.E.) a Privy Council and Cabinet, a Legislative Assembly and a Judiciary. The Legislative Assembly consists of the Premier and Ministers of the Crown (including the Governors of Vava'u and Ha'apai) seven representatives of the nobles elected by their peers, and seven representatives of the people elected by popular franchise, every Tongan of 21 years of age who pays taxes and can read and write being qualified to vote. Elections are held every three years. The President of the Legislative Assembly is the Speaker, appointed by the Sovereign. The courts consist of a Supreme Court, a Magistrate's Court and a Land Court. By Order in Council No. 458 of 1952 the responsibilities of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in respect of the Kingdom of Tonga were transferred with effect from the 1st April, 1952, to the Governor of Fiji, in his personal capacity, who acts through Her Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Consul in Tonga. Under the revised Treaty the Governor of Fiji, in his relations with Tonga, is known as the United Kingdom Chief Commissioner for Tonga. British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, for the enforcing of which the Minister of Police is responsible, not including crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for over two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga courts. In other respects they are for the time being subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific but his jurisdiction may be transferred to the Supreme Court of Fiji in due course, as provided by the Order in Council referred to above.
Land

Every male Tongan on reaching the taxable age of 16 years is entitled to 8 acres of land for cultivation in addition to a small village allotment for his dwelling.

Land may not be leased to non-Tongans without the consent of the Government. Immigrant settlement is not encouraged owing to the increasing shortage of land available for tax allotments and local purposes.

Taxation

For the allotments described in the preceding paragraph an annual tax of 8s, a year is paid and in addition an annual tax of 32s., for which free education, medical, hospital and dental treatment are provided. Indirect taxation includes import duties (general tariff 33½% ad valorem, British preferential tariff 15% ad valorem) and a Port and Customs Service tax on imports of 5%. There is also an export duty on copra of 10% of the f.o.b. value at date of export.

* Revised estimate.

About 60 per cent. of revenue accrues from Customs duty. The main heads of expenditure are Public Works, Medical, Miscellaneous, Education and Agriculture. The financial year commences on 1st July. There is no Public Debt, and surplus funds account stood at £T.991,824 on the 30th June 1960.

Currency

The Tonga £ has the same official exchange value as the Australian £ (£1 sterling = £A1 5s. 0d.). The note issue is of denominations of £5, £1, 10s. and 4s.; the main tender status coinage in use is Australian, though United Kingdom, New Zealand and Fiji coins are also in circulation.

Education

At the end of 1959 there were 135 primary schools (77 State schools and the remainder run by Missions); post-primary education is provided by three Government and 21 Mission schools. There is a training school for Government and Mission primary school teachers. In 1959 the total attendance at primary schools was 14,811; at post-primary schools 3,482. Estimated government expenditure on education (exclusive of buildings and building maintenance) amounted to £(Tongan)94,910 in 1960-61 compared with £5,796 in 1936-37.

Health

The Government of Tonga Medical Department operates three public hospitals and a number of dispensaries. In 1959, 3,383 in-patients and 54,899 out-patients were treated. Estimated Government expenditure on medical services (exclusive of buildings and building maintenance) amounted to £(Tongan)96,706 in 1960-61 as compared with £7,006 in 1936-37.

Communications

There is a good aerodrome on the island of Tongatapu some 15 miles from Nuku'alofa, and limited seaplane facilities at Nuku'alofa and Vava'u harbours. Fiji Airways Limited operate a four-weekly schedule with Heron aircraft between Fiji and Tongatapu.

There are approximately 83 miles of metalled road in Tongatapu and 28 miles in Vava'u suitable for motor traffic. There are some 250 miles of unsealed roads which are only usable by motor traffic in dry weather.

The chief ports, which are also ports of entry, are Nuku'alofa and Neiafu on Vava'u. In 1959 Nuku'alofa entered 152,007 and cleared 115,145 tons of shipping, and Vava'u entered 388 and cleared 61,227 tons of shipping. Ha'apai was a port of entry for Bank Line vessels only uplifting copra and vessels entered amounted to 24,027 tons. Few ships now enter at Vava'u owing to the local restrictions to control the Rhinoceros beetle, a coconut pest found now in the northerly islands of the Group. A regular monthly passenger and cargo service from New Zealand via Fiji is maintained by the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand. Regular cargo services are maintained by vessels of the Bank Line and the Union Steam Ship Company. The former lift copra for the United Kingdom and the latter discharge general cargo from Australia and United Kingdom transhipment cargo from Fiji. Occasional vessels of the Pacific Islands Transport Line—a Norwegian firm—call to discharge timber from Canada.

The Tonga Shipping Agency has now been set up under the joint control of Government and the Tonga Copra Board. Agency vessels maintain regular internal services between islands of the group and a four-weekly passenger and cargo service with the Fiji Islands which lie on main shipping and aircraft routes between Australasia and the United Kingdom.

Broadcasting

A local broadcasting station is being constructed and should commence broadcasts early in 1961.

Principal Occupations

Tonga is essentially an agricultural country, and, in general, a land of peasant proprietors. A minute proportion of the population seeks employment in the Government Services, in the stores and European leaseholds. Increased employment opportunities are now occurring in stevedoring, and development and building projects undertaken by Government, Produce Boards and a construction company.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are coconuts, bananas, kumalas, yams, taro, cassava, groundnuts, candlenuts, maize, fungus, watermelons and pineapples.

Livestock number (rough estimate in 1959): horses 6,550, cattle 1,731, goats 2,099, pigs 14,200, poultry 34,500.

Limited areas of forest lands are found in the islands of 'Eua and Vava'u, but there are no exports of timber.

There is an abundance of fish in the waters of the Group which provides a constant fish diet for the inhabitants.
The only manufacturing industry in Tonga is one for the expressing of juices from citrus, pineapple and passion fruits.

**Area**

The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles (Northern Province 28,898, Buganda 25,631, Eastern Province 25,607, Western Province 13,845) of which 13,689 square miles are water and swamp.

**Population**

The estimated total population of the Protectorate at 30th June 1959 was 6,517,000.

The total non-African population as shown by the 1959 census was 87,058, made up as follows:

- Indians: 63,130
- Pakistanis: 5,973
- Goans: 2,830
- Arabs: 1,946
- Europeans: 10,866
- Others: 2,313

The total African population in the 1959 Census was 6,449,558 compared with 4,917,555 in 1948.

**Principal Towns**

The principal towns are Entebbe (seat of the Governor and the Central Government, population about 11,000), Kampala (commercial capital, population nearing 50,000), Jinja (population over 30,000), Mbale and Masaka. Administrative and trading centres also exist at Tororo, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale and Mubende, and there are many other smaller towns and trading centres throughout the Territory.

**Geographical Features**

The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,030 feet at Lake Albert and below 2,000 feet in the valley of the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges, the Mufumbiro or Birunga range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhavura (13,540 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley with its twin peaks Margherita (16,763 feet) and Alexandra (16,703 feet) is the highest point. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasien (10,074 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, the Aswa and the Malawa. The total area of forest is approximately 2,900 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.

**Climate**

The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° F. and 75° F. but is lower in the highlands of the west and south-west. In the Entebbe/Kampala area (approximately 3,700 feet above sea level) the mean annual
temperature is 71° F., the mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures are 79° F. and 63° F. respectively. The average rainfall varies from 30 to 60 inches according to the area. The rainy seasons are not clearly defined and vary from one long season from April to September in the extreme north to two seasons March to May and September to November at the Equator.

**History**

In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa's dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there was a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company's influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga's kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June 1894.

Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga's kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1899 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and in 1900 concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. Agreements were also made in 1900 with the ruler and chiefs of Toro and in 1901 with the ruler and chiefs of Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1902 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika. In 1905 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.

**Constitution**

The Uganda Order in Council, 1920, provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions.

Changes in structure of both Councils were approved by the Secretary of State in July 1955. By these changes Executive Council consists of 13 members (10 of whom are Ministers), and the Governor as President.

The Legislative Council consists of 62 members and is presided over by a Speaker. The members are made up of 3 *ex officio* members, 14 other Government ministers and officials, and 15 nominated members on the Government Backbench; the remaining 30 are representative members of whom six are European, six are Asian, and 18 are African. Arrangements were made in 1958 for direct elections of African Representative members to be held on the basis of a qualitative franchise in all Districts that wanted them, with the exception of Karamoja. Ten African Representative members were returned in the nine Districts which accepted the arrangements.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern, and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the others owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 and the Buganda Agreement, 1955, by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka, acting as a constitutional ruler, with the advice of six Ministers. A hierarchy of appointed chiefs are the executive officers of government. The Great Lukiko (i.e. the council of Buganda) contains 89 members of whom 40 are elected indirectly and 20 are elected by the county councils.

In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces African Administrations have been established under the African Local Governments Ordinance 1949 and the District Administration (District Councils) Ordinance 1955, with district councils as the most important organs. Most of these councils have a majority of members who are elected, either directly or through lower councils. The latter have been established in most districts at parish, sub-county and county levels; they have as yet few specific functions. All District Councils have as their principal executive officers elected or appointed Secretaries-General and Treasurers, and in all districts there is a hierarchy of appointed chiefs as the executive officers of local government. In the Agreement districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro there are traditional hereditary Rulers whose positions are defined in the Agreements.

**Land Policy**

Approximately 10,000 square miles of land is registered as being in private ownership of Africans, mainly in Buganda and Western Province. Approximately 440 square miles is in non-African hands. The remainder of the land in the Territory is vested in the Crown in trust for the use and benefit of the African population. In townships and in Buganda province Africans may only occupy such land in accordance with a lease or licence; elsewhere they may occupy it without lease or licence according to native custom. It is Government's policy to issue freehold titles to Africans occupying Crown land by native custom where the demand for such titles is shown to exist. No further grants in freehold are made to non-Africans, and alienations by lease are given only
after consultation with the African Local Government concerned. African-owned land may not be transferred to non-Africans without the consent of the Minister of Lands and Mineral Development.

Taxation

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll tax, export taxes, stamp duties, and Customs and excise duties.

Income Tax is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from or received in East Africa by residents after any personal allowances have been deducted, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents. There is provision for double taxation relief between Uganda and the United Kingdom, Canada, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Denmark and Sweden. Any person liable to pay African poll tax is exempt from paying income tax.

Poll Tax is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of Sh. 6/- per year throughout the Protectorate. An African Authority Tax is levied by African authorities varying up to £20 according to district and capacity to pay. Non-African Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £7 10/- on taxpayers whose income exceeds £200 per annum and £3 15/- on taxpayers with lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

Export Taxes are levied on lint cotton, coffee and hides and skins on a sliding scale by value.

Companies Tax. The rate of Income Tax applicable to companies is Shs. 5/50 on every £ of income accrued in, derived from or received in the Protectorate. Non-resident companies are assessed on income accrued in or derived from the Protectorate. A special rate of Shs. 9/50 in the £ is charged on the undistributed profits of companies which are resident in the Protectorate and in which the public are not substantially interested. This rate applies to the total income of the company less an allowance of 32½% of the trading income and any dividends declared out of such profits.

Customs and Excise. The tariff is divided into ad valorem, specific and free goods. Ad valorem duties vary from 11% to 60%, the latter assessment only applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations. The basic rate of import duty is 22% ad valorem. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:—Sugar, cigarettes, cigars, manufactured tobacco, beer, spirits and matches.

The currency is under the control of the East African Currency Board in Nairobi. The unit of currency is the shilling, which is sub-divided into 100 cents. Coins and notes of the following denominations circulate in Uganda:

Coins : 1/-, 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent.

Notes : 5/-, 10/-, 20/-, 100/-, and 200/-.

Shs. 1,000/- and 10,000/- notes are used only for transactions between the Banks and the Currency Board and are not in general circulation.
Development Plans

Under a three-year Capital Expenditure Forecast published in 1960, development expenditure excluding capital development by corporations is envisaged amounting to £17,000,000 over the years 1960-61, 1961-62 and 1962-63. This sum is broken down into the following categories:

| Category                                      | £ million |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Administration (including Revenue Collection, Financial Control, Information and Printing) | 0·6       |

| **Total**                                      | **16·9**  |

The capital resources available from July 1960 are estimated as follows:

| Source                                      | £ million |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Capital Development Fund                    | 3·9       |

Other Development

The Uganda Development Corporation Limited was established by Government in 1952 with an authorized capital of £8,000,000 (£6,400,000 issued). The Corporation's purpose is to facilitate the industrial and economic development of the Protectorate by promoting and assisting in the financing, management or establishment of new undertakings wherever possible in conjunction with private enterprise and of schemes for the better organization, modernization or efficient carrying out of any undertaking. Its subsidiary companies are the Uganda Cement Industry Limited, Uganda Hotels Limited, Agricultural Enterprises Limited, Uganda Consolidated Properties Limited, the Uganda Metal Products and Enamelling Company Limited and Nyanza Textile Industries, Limited, which produces cloth from locally grown cotton.

The Corporation is associated in other enterprises engaged in the development of mining and manufactures. One of these, Kilembe Mines Limited, is producing copper from deposits in Western Uganda, and smelting it at Jinja prior to export. Another, Sukulu Mines Limited, has been formed to mine and process the mineral complex at Sukulu, near Tororo, which consists principally of apatite, magnetite, and pyrochlore.

The Uganda Credit and Savings Bank was established in 1950 to make available to Africans facilities for loans for agricultural and commercial purposes; initial capital was provided by the Uganda Government.

At 30th June 1960 deposits in the Savings Bank Section amounted to over £1,300,000, in over 40,000 accounts; 434 loan accounts were open at this date with outstanding balances of over £300,000. There are eight Branches of the Bank, and six Agencies established in up-country centres. The Bank also acts as agent in operating the African Loans Fund (for making loans to Africans whose credit-worthiness relies more on guarantees by Local Governments than on the normal security required by the Bank) and the Revolving Loan Fund of the International Co-operation Administration.

The Uganda Electricity Board, a public utility corporation, is pressing forward with extensions to the distribution of electricity supplies which are obtained mainly from the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja where there is an installed capacity of 105,000 kW, and which is capable of expansion to provide 150,000 kW. It is estimated that there is an additional potential output of some 500,000 kW, in the 19 mile stretch of the river Nile below Owen Falls, and even more than this amount on the reach of the Nile between Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert.

Education

The number of children at school in Uganda has almost trebled in the decade 1947-57 and it is estimated that at present 60% of the country's child population between the ages of 6 and 11 attends primary school. In 1959 there were 245,125 boys and 109,348 girls attending the 2,306 grant-aided primary schools and there was a total enrolment of 25,552 at the 227 grant-aided secondary schools. The total number of un-aided schools was 3,406 with an enrolment of 155,828. There were 36 Teacher Training Colleges with 3,766 students, and 96 technical and trade schools with a total of 4,040 students.

The University College of East Africa is at Makerere (Kampala) and is an autonomous institution catering for all the East African territories. Since 1953 the college has, in special relationship with London University, awarded degrees to its students. In 1959 there were 881 students attending the College of whom 304 were from Uganda. In the same year there were 1,077 Uganda students attending courses overseas in the United Kingdom, India, the United States and elsewhere. Of this total 473 were African, 564 Asian and 40 European. Most of the African students and a minority of the Asian students are supported by scholarships or bursaries from various sources. The East African Governments are presently considering the establishment of a University of East Africa.

The total recurrent expenditure by the Protectorate Government on all types of education, in the financial year 1958-59 was £4,286,000. Capital expenditure totalled £325,000. Government expenditure in 1935 was £76,093.

Libraries and Museums, etc.

Makerere College has the largest library in East Africa, consisting of 46,000 volumes and 44,000 pamphlets and unbound parts, and is the territory's official deposit library. Kampala Municipal Council runs a public library in Kampala, and both the British Council and the United States Information Services also have libraries in Kampala. There is a British Council branch library in their Mbale regional office and a Uganda Literature and Libraries Service has been formed to encourage the establishment of libraries in other district Headquarters. The Uganda Museum (Kampala) was established fifty years ago, and displays mainly ethnographic and archaeological material.
Health

The commonest causes of illness are malaria, respiratory infections, diseases of the digestive system, trachoma, tropical ulcers and venereal disease.

Special attention is being paid to the control of tuberculosis and leprosy. Special wards are available for the treatment of tuberculosis cases at Mulago and nine district hospitals, but treatment is given to in-patients and out-patients at all district hospitals. During the year just over 2,000 new cases came under treatment for the first time. From widespread surveys it is estimated that the total number of lepers in the Protectorate is about 80,000. About 30,000 of these received treatment during the year. In addition to the five major leprosy centres run by the Missions, African Local Governments have established £5 treatment villages.

In addition to Mulago, which is the teaching hospital for Makerere College Medical School with 670 beds, the Department maintains 28 hospitals at the main centres giving a combined bed strength for all races of 3,910. In rural areas the African Local Governments, in conjunction with the Medical Department, maintain 174 Units with a bed strength of 2,508 of which 460 are reserved for maternity cases. Beds in Mission hospitals and dispensaries, industrial concerns, privately owned nursing homes, etc., amount to 3,215. The total number of beds throughout the Protectorate therefore amounts to 9,633, which gives a ratio of approximately 1·5 hospital beds per 1,000 of the population.

In 1959, 102,835 patients were admitted to Government hospitals, and 1,299,094 were treated as out-patients. In addition, 2,546,865 new cases were treated at dispensaries.

Expenditure on Medical and Health Services for the financial year 1958–59 was £1,836,994 compared with £148,907 in 1935.

Communications

At Entebbe there is a first-class international airport with a main runway capable of receiving all commercial aircraft now flying or likely to fly through Entebbe in the foreseeable future. The Airport is equipped with the latest navigational aids, and the safety services are of a high standard. The main trunk route operators use Entebbe, which has excellent flying weather throughout the year, and in addition charter companies and the Royal Air Force make use of the Airport. It is estimated that about 80,800 passengers used the airport during 1959.

Secondary airfields are maintained by the Uganda Government at Kasese, Jinja, Tororo, Soroti, Gulu, Arua, Paraa, Masindi, Lira, Mbarara and Moroto, the first seven of which are served on regular schedules by the East African Airways Corporation.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission").

The direct line from the coast runs westwards across the Protectorate through Tororo, Jinja and Kampala to Kasese near the Congo border. A branch line from Tororo serves Mbale and Soroti, and will be extended during 1961 to Lira. Another line northwards from Jinja connects at Namasagali with a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga to Masindi Port. The Railways Administration operates a road transport service between Masindi Port and Butiaba on Lake Albert, and a steamer service on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule which is connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan. Another steamer service operates between Butiaba and the Congo ports of Mahagi and Kasenyi on the west shore of Lake Albert. A through service is thus provided by the Railways Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Congo. In addition regular steamer services connect Port Bell, Entebbe and Bukakata on Lake Victoria with Kisumu and Tanganyika ports.

The Ministry of Works maintains 520 miles of tarmac road and 2,444 miles of all-weather murram roads connecting the principal towns; the various African Local Governments between them maintain a further 4,418 miles of all-weather murram roads and 3,882 miles of lesser murram roads of variable standard.

Broadcasting

The Uganda Broadcasting Service commenced regular transmission on 1st March 1954 and now broadcasts daily in English, Luganda, Runyoro, Lwo and Ateso and weekly in Runyankore, Lugbara and Hindustani. It operates on frequencies of 5,026 and 9,590 kc/s in the 60 and 31 metre bands respectively and also on 971 kc/s and 548 kc/s in the medium wave band. Each of the medium wave channels is powered by 24 kW transmitters operating in parallel; the short wave channel is powered by a 7½ kW transmitter. The transmitters are situated at Bugolobi near Kampala. Permanent studios are situated in Kampala.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle-raising on their own account. The numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in the principal industries and occupations in June 1959 were:

| Industry                                      | Number |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture                                   | 46,055 |
| Government Service (Administrative)           | 14,665 |
| African Local Governments                    | 38,328 |
| Cotton Ginning                                | 3,950  |
| Coffee Curing                                 | 1,774  |
| Forestry and Fishing                          | 3,582  |

| Building and Construction                     | 31,778 |
| Education and Medical Services                | 21,560 |
| Other Services                                 | 14,890 |

Total ........................................... 224,260

The foregoing figures are based on a census covering all employers except domestic service and peasant agriculture. The estimated total numbers in employment, including domestic service and peasant agriculture, are 298,000 Africans, 10,000 Asians and 4,650 Europeans.

There are 22 registered trade unions with a total membership of 12,800 and 11 associations of employees with a total membership of 4,020. Joint staff committees or works councils have been introduced in 127 establishments covering some 101,000 employees.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), sugar, tea, tobacco, millets, maize, plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava and groundnuts.
The number of cattle sold in established markets in 1959 was 135,160, while the total number slaughtered for consumption exceeded 470,000. Hides and skins are an important export.

Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hard-woods, but more than 6,000 acres of softwood timber plantations are being created annually. The greater part of the timber production is consumed in the Protectorate and in the adjoining East African territories, but a small and increasing proportion is exported mainly to Great Britain. During 1958 about 1½ million cubic feet of sawn timber of an estimated value of about £1,000,000 were produced and a plywood industry is now well established.

Copper is the chief metal produced, and in 1959 output of blister copper amounted to 11,930 long tons, of which 11,797 tons, worth £2,780,980 were exported. Production of wolfram, which had virtually ceased, began again under the incentive of more favourable world prices but towards the end of the year prices fell again and annual production remained low. Quantities of tin, beryl, lead concentrates, apatite, bismuth, gold, niobium and tantalum were produced. Exports of tin and lead concentrates, beryl and bismuth were at a higher level than in 1958. Geological survey work and mineral prospecting continues.

The fishing industry is of great importance, and expanding. The present production is approximately 55,000 tons of fish per year, worth over £2½ million, and of this over 10,000 tons are exported.

The Uganda Cement Industry at Tororo has an annual capacity of 150,000 tons, more than sufficient to meet local consumption of cement. The textile factory at Jinja produces cloth from locally grown cotton. Annual output on three-shift production is at the rate of 13 million yards of various types of cloth—greys, drills and dyes. A £1,000,000 expansion programme was started at the end of 1959. A factory for the production of all types of plywood including marine and tea chests was opened at Jinja in 1959. In the 1959 season 134 cotton ginneries were operated. The coffee crop was processed by 12 coffee curing works and seven licensed hulleries. One registered co-operative licenses to operate estate coffee factories. Amongst other undertakings processing agricultural produce were two sugar factories, one tobacco-processing plant, and a large number of maize mills and oil-expressing mills.

The principal imports are machinery, vehicles and bicycles; cotton piece-goods and other textiles; base metal manufactures; rubber tyres and tubes; fuels and lubricants.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Provision has been made by legislation for the organized marketing of cotton and coffee, the two main cash crops of the Protectorate. The Lint Marketing Board is responsible for the sale of the lint cotton and seed and the Coffee Marketing Board for the coffee crop (excepting the Bugisu arabica crop and the produce of estates and associations of African growers permitted to conduct their own sales). Producer prices are announced before the marketing season opens and it is also the practice to announce a minimum guaranteed price for cotton at planting time.

Co-operative development was given formal recognition by Government by the enactment of co-operative legislation in 1946 and the establishment of a Co-operative Department to assist and guide the growth of the movement. Since that time 1,598 societies have been registered, 15 of which are co-operative unions. Membership of the 1,583 primary societies was 187,860.

Eleven cotton ginneries are now owned by co-operative unions while two are leased. In 1959 these ginneries produced 52,430 bales of lint cotton or 13·07% of the total baled production of the Protectorate.

The Bugisu Co-operative Union again marketed the whole of the Bugisu arabica coffee crop which amounted to 4,042 tons. Of the 18,548 tons of clean robusta coffee handled by co-operative unions, the Uganda Growers' Co-operative Union produced 9,543 tons at its factory in Kawempe, near Kampala, and the Masaka District Co-operative Union produced 5,700 tons.

The total turnover of co-operative societies in 1959 amounted to £4,985,162, and by the Unions amounted to £6,622,330.

The Cotton Price Assistance Fund stood at £15,981,181 (revised) at 30th June 1959. The Coffee Price Assistance Fund, as at 31st October 1959, stood at £11,632,044.
