SEYCHELLES

Area

The Colony lies in the Indian Ocean 970 miles east of Zanzibar. Its area is 156½ square miles.

Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to cover 55½ square miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Felicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf and Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island are also dependencies of Seychelles.

Population

The 1960 census totalled 41,425.

Principal Town

Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 10,000.

Geographical Features

The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over fourteen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate

In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon, and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. The average annual rainfall in Victoria for the past 57 years is 91-13 inches and the mean temperature was 82°. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare.

History

The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May 1794 when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Ile de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution, and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August 1903 this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

Constitution

The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. Under a 1960 Order in Council the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, four ex officio members, five elected and three nominated members of whom at least one must be an unofficial. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy

All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation

The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. This is chargeable on all earned or investment income arising in or derived from the Territory. In addition tax is payable by residents on investment income arising out of the Colony or on earned income remitted thereto, the basis of assessment being income arising in the calendar year preceding year of assessment.

Rates of tax, after deduction of allowances, are:

- 5% on first Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 12½% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 25% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 30% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 40% on next Rs. 10,000 of chargeable income
- 50% on next Rs. 20,000 of chargeable income
- 60% on any excess over Rs. 50,000.

No tax is charged where the total income does not exceed Rs. 2,400. Companies, partnerships, etc., pay a flat rate of 35%.
Allowances are made to resident taxpayers:

- Earned income Rs. 3,000 (max. Rs. 1,500).
- Personal (single) Rs. 2,000.
- Personal (married) Rs. 3,500.
- Children Rs. 500 (max. Rs. 2,500).

Additional allowance of Rs. 1,000 may be claimed for child over 11 years studying abroad.

Dependent relative Rs. 500 (limited to one relative) if relative is infirm, maintained by claimant and not in receipt of an income exceeding Rs. 500.

In addition, allowances may be claimed in respect of life insurance, superannuation, alimony, and deductions against plant and machinery owned and operated by the assessee.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

**Education**

There are 38 primary schools, 7 secondary schools, a trade training centre, a centre for continuation classes and in-service teacher training, and a teacher training college.

In October 1960 there were 3,023 boys and 3,015 girls in primary schools, and 378 boys and 485 girls in secondary schools. There is no higher education in the Colony apart from teacher training. Thirty students are undergoing further education or vocational training in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on education in 1959 was Rs. 952,430 and that of religious missions Rs. 61,095.

**Libraries**

Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust, and there are small libraries run by the Co-operation Book Society, the Roman Catholic Mission and the Alliance Française.

**Health**

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has very few diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria, yellow fever and relapsing fever are absent and filariasis is infrequent. The incidence of leprosy is diminishing. That of intestinal infestation and amoebiasis continues high. A programme for improving sanitation in Victoria has been started. Tuberculosis is being dealt with by B.C.G. inoculation, starting with the schools.

The Public Health Service is organized under the Medical Officer of Health and consists of nine Health Inspectors and six Health Visitors. Seven Health Inspectors are stationed in Mahé, and two in Praslin. The Health Visitors, with one exception, are stationed in Mahé. There is one Health Visitor in Praslin.

There are infant welfare, antenatal and V.D. clinics at several centres on Mahé and Praslin and also on La Digue. An immunization centre at Victoria deals with yellow fever, diphtheria, T.A.B. and other inoculations. Dental facilities are available daily in Victoria, weekly at Anse Royale, fortnightly at Beolière and periodically on Praslin and La Digue.

A School Health Service was established in 1957, and covers all the schools in the Colony. School follow-up clinics are also arranged by the Public Health Nurses for the instruction of parents. Immunization of infants against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus was started in 1957 in all the infant welfare clinics.

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 86 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet. Tarmac surfacing is in progress, 30 miles having been completed.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 55 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé, and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. Passenger ships of the British India Line and of the Eastern Shipping Corporation combine at present to operate a service giving a call twice a month both eastwards and westwards in the case of the former line, and once a month both eastwards and westwards in the case of the latter line. The British India ships run from Durban to Bombay, and the Eastern Shipping Corporation operates from Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to Bombay.

Occasional passenger-carrying cargo boats run directly from London (Brocklebank Line) or from Singapore (Royal Interocean Line).

Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and wired broadcasting) Station at Victoria Road, Mahé, broadcasts nightly for two hours on a wavelength of 60·2 metres, 4,990 kc/s. with an output of 40 W. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

No receiving licences are issued.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 6,500 are so employed. Approximate numbers employed in other occupations in 1960 were:

- Domestic service: 1,750
- Public Works: 2,500
- Public administration: 250
- Trade and commerce: 400
- Skilled workers: 2,150

There are six registered Trade Unions—

(2) The Seychelles Building Trades Union.
(3) The General Workers’ Union.
(4) The Seychelles Teachers’ Union.
(5) The Seychelles Cable and Wireless Limited Staff Union.
(6) The Seychelles Christian Workers Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

No figures are available of the livestock population.

Inshore fisheries’ estimated production is 1,000–1,500 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds’ eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally-made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production has also commenced.

Sierra Leone

Area

The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925, South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

Population

The latest estimate of population is 2,400,000 (Colony 160,000; Protectorate 2,240,000). Twenty-five per cent of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these, and about 2,000 Europeans and Asians, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

Principal Towns

| Estimated Population |
|----------------------|
| Freetown, capital    | 125,000 |
| Bo, S.W. Province    | 40,000  |
| Kenema, S.E. Province| 7,000   |
| Makeni, N. Province  | 8,000   |

Geographical Features

Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which reaches 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.

Climate

There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground.
Most of the rain falls in the three months July-September. The mean temperature is approximately 80°, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately 10°, inland it is approximately 20° on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25-30% inland.

**History**

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government". This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January 1808 the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August 1896 a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

**Constitution**

That part of Sierra Leone administered as a Colony includes the Sierra Leone Peninsula, Tasso Island, Banana Island, and York Island, and the township of Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

Following the Conference in London in April, 1960 between the Secretary of State and representatives of all political parties in Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone (Constitution) (Amendment) Order in Council, 1960 was made. The Order which provides for a Cabinet consisting of the Prime Minister as president and not less than 7 other Ministers, came into operation on the 9th of July, 1960. Both the Prime Minister and the Ministers are appointed from the Elected Members of the House of Representatives.

The Governor, who does not sit in the Cabinet save when he summons a meeting, continues to see all papers and to receive all information concerning the Government which are available to the Cabinet and may in his discretion refer a recommendation back to the Cabinet once. The Governor is empowered by the Order in Council to direct a Minister to perform on the Governor's behalf, but subject to his control, any power or duty relating to a subject within the special responsibilities of the Governor.

In order to secure the independence of the Judges of the Supreme Court provision is made in the Order in Council for the appointment by the Governor of the Chief Justice, Senior Puisne Judge and Puisne Judges. Provision is also made for their removal by the Governor, after due enquiry, for inability to perform the functions of their office or for misbehaviour. They are also expressly exempt from the provisions of the Sierra Leone (Public Service Commission) Order in Council, 1953.

There is also provision in the Order in Council for the adaptation of existing laws to bring them into conformity with the Order in Council.

The 1958 Order in Council provides for a House of Representatives consisting of a Speaker, 51 elected members and two nominated members, the last to have no voting powers. Of the 51 elected members, 14 represent Freetown and the Colony area, 25 represent Electoral Districts in the Protectorate, and the remaining 12 are Paramount Chiefs elected by the 12 District Councils in the Protectorate. Elections to the new House on a franchise extended to include virtually all adult males and all adult female taxpayers or property owners, were held in May 1957 and the House met for the first time in July 1957.

With regard to the Protectorate, in 1956, under the provisions of the District Councils (Amendment) Ordinance, 1956, the representation of each Chiefdom in the District Council was increased. Each Chiefdom is represented by the Paramount Chief by virtue of his office and one elected member for each ward of a district which in practice approximates to one representative to a thousand taxpayers, Districts being divided on a Chiefdom basis. The District Council franchise is substantially the same as that for the House of Representatives election. The Townships Ordinance, 1959 provides for the establishment of town councils in certain large towns in the Protectorate. At present only one exists, the Bo Town Council having been established under a previous Ordinance enacted for that specific purpose.

**Land Policy**

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding 50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.
The Sierra Leone Colony Letters Patent, 1960 provide for delegation to any member of the Cabinet of the Governor's powers to make grants and dispositions of any lands or other immovable property within the Colony.

Taxation

There are two forms of direct taxation in force: income tax and local tax. Income tax is chargeable on individuals at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man is granted £200, and a married man £300 as an initial relief; there are allowances up to a maximum of £200 for children (not more than eight) up to the age of 16 years or so long as they are receiving whole-time education; and for life assurance premia within certain limits. There is an abatement of 6d. in the 1s. rate up to a maximum of £400 chargeable income to offset the reduction in reliefs recently introduced. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. A double taxation agreement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government and with a number of other Governments including Ghana, Nigeria and Gambia.

A Local Tax Ordinance introduced in 1954 replaces the House Tax, formerly paid by all adult native males, by a Local Tax. This is at present subject to a maximum of 30s. per head, and within chiefdoms is paid at a fixed rate. In general terms payment applies to all adult male persons residing in each chiefdom and in certain cases to adult females also. Revenue from this tax is divided between District Councils and Native Administrations.

The main form of indirect taxation is the Customs tariff.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100/-, 20/- and 10/-; yellow metal alloy coins of 2/-, 1/- and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ½d. In addition bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. are now in circulation. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946 (and reviewed in 1949 when "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was published). The Plans provided for the development of Communications, Natural Resources and Social and Basic Services at a total cost of £5,000,000 in the ten-year period.

Under the new Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1959, an allocation of £2,000,000 has been made and a new Development Programme is in process of being drawn up. Agreement in principle has also been given for an Exchequer loan from the United Kingdom of £3,000,000, the greater part of which will finance the continuation of schemes started under the original Development Plan of 1949.

A Colonial Development and Welfare allocation of £450,000 has also been made for capital works at Fourah Bay College.

Education

In 1959 primary education, for pupils between the ages of 5+ and 12, was provided in 550 schools (an increase of 28 over the preceding year), the enrolment in which was 74,481. The increase in enrolment was approximately 5,200. The basic course is now of seven years duration though all schools have not yet provided the full course.

Secondary education, for pupils between the ages of 12+ and 18+ was provided in 28 schools of which 8 were entirely supported by the Central Government, 18 were assisted and 2 unassisted, except for minor grants. The total enrolment was 6,808 representing an increase of about 16%. The majority of the schools in the Provinces are not yet fully developed in that they provide three-year courses instead of the normal five-year courses leading to School Certificate or seven-year courses leading to Higher School Certificate.

There were six teacher-training colleges in the territory, with a total enrolment of 615. The former Teacher Training Department at Fourah Bay College has now become the Freetown Teacher Training College.

Two technical institutes, one in Freetown, another in Kenema, provide various courses for 230 full-time and 555 part-time students. There is also a small vocational centre for girls, in Bo.

University courses in Theology, Arts, Science, Economic Studies and Education, were provided at Fourah Bay College, the University College of
Sierra Leone which is affiliated to the University of Durham in England. At the beginning of the 1959-60 Session, 179 Sierra Leone students were in attendance at these courses. Three chairs, in English, Mathematics and Economics have been established.

The Department of Extra Mural Studies at Fourah Bay College has expanded appreciably its adult education courses and is extending its work farther into the Provinces.

The Government has continued its policy of awarding a large number of scholarships for secondary and higher education. The number awarded in 1959 (excluding those awarded by Government Departments to members of their staff) was as follows:

(i) Secondary School Education . . 1,959
(ii) Higher School Certificate Studies . . 53
(iii) Teacher-Training . . 615
(iv) Higher Education at Fourah Bay College and overseas . . 377

The recurrent expenditure on education, by the Central Government, was £1,651,388 as compared with £38,518 in 1935.

Literacy campaigns were conducted in 1959 by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in over 40 chiefdoms and also amongst Vernacular-speaking people in the Colony Area as a result of which 529 reading certificates were issued. The Bureau reported that in ten years 45,800 people were estimated to have attained literacy in one vernacular; 259,421 vernacular books were sold within the last five years of the period.

Libraries

Fourah Bay College has a library of some 28,000 volumes. The British Council maintains subscription libraries in Freetown and Bo with a total of over 20,000 books, makes bulk loans of books, and despatches book-boxes and periodicals to institutions throughout the country.

Health

The Medical Department integrated with the Ministry of Health on the 1st April 1960.

The common diseases encountered in Sierra Leone are malaria, schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, leprosy, yaws, dysentery, pneumonia, venereal diseases, intestinal parasites, tropical ulcers, chicken-pox and measles. Yellow fever is endemic but no case has been reported during the last five years. Smallpox and cerebro-spinal fever are sporadic.

Since 1957 an intensive vaccination campaign against smallpox has been undertaken. Two campaigns sponsored by W.H.O./U.N.I.C.E.F. against yaws and leprosy are also in operation.

In 1959 beds available in hospitals, general, maternity and special (excluding two Infirmarys) totalled 1,498 (Government 1,104, Missions 312, Mining 82). In-patients numbered 23,932 and out-patients 587,686. There were 43 Government dispensaries and Health Centres (excluding 22 treatment centres attached to the Endemic Diseases Control Unit) at which 374,203 attendances were recorded.

Actual expenditure on medical and allied services in 1959 was £767,854. By comparison actual expenditure in 1935 was £63,923.

Communications

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the international airport, and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Scheduled Air Services are operated by Air France, Ghana Airways, Nigerian Airways, U.A.T., British United Airways and Air Liban. They connect Sierra Leone to other parts of West Africa and provide at least seven services a week to and from Europe. In addition, the Sierra Leone Airways operate within the territory from Hastings (Freetown) to Bo, Kenema, Daru, Magburaka and Port Loko.

Air and marine navigational aids, and aeradio and meteorological radio services, are available.

The railway carried 1,968,808 passengers and 133,890 tons of freight in the period 1st January 1958 to 31st March 1959. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 345. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 57½ miles.

There are 3,575 miles of road, 1,775 miles of roads maintained by the Public Works Department, including 196 miles of bitumen surfaced roads, approximately 1,600 miles of roads maintained by local government bodies and approximately 200 miles maintained by private companies.

All government roads and most of the remainder are motorable throughout the year, though occasionally ferries are closed for a few days at a time because of abnormal flooding or the need for repairs.

Freetown, a port of British Shipping Registry, has anchorage room for 240 ships of unrestricted draught and berths for two large or three small ships alongside the new Queen Elizabeth II Quay, which is 1,250 feet long with a depth of 32 feet of water at Mean Low Water Ordinary Spring. Oil bunkers can be obtained by ships alongside the Quay, and ships also berth alongside the nearby Kissy Oil Jetty for oil bunkers, or to discharge various types of fuel into the Oil Storage Company's tanks. Smaller ports are at Pepel and Bonthé. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines; Bonthé is a loading port for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piassava. Regular passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines Limited and Palm Lines Limited. Twenty-four other shipping lines provide services to the Continent, the Middle East, South Africa, India, the Far East and America.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and to Bonthé in the south.

Broadcasting

The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service, transmitting from Freetown, was inaugurated in 1955 and at present operates from 6.45 to 8.00 a.m. and 4.45 to 10.00 p.m. on the frequency of 3,316 kilocycles in the 90 metre band with a power of 5 kilowatts. The Service consists of approximately 4½ hours' local programme and the remainder re-radiated B.B.C. Overseas Service.

The Department of Broadcasting came into being on 1st January 1958, the programme side of the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service having broken away from the former Public Relations (now Information) Department. The transmitters
were taken over from Posts and Telecommunications Department early in 1959. Completely new Studio equipment is being installed under the supervision of the Chief Engineer. It is planned to install new and more powerful transmitters on another site as soon as possible.

On the 31st December 1958 the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 3,146, and the number of subscribers to the Government operated wire system in Freetown was 4,295.

Principal Occupations

It is estimated that over half the population is engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups at the end of 1959 to be as follows:

- Building and Construction: 9,591
- Mining: 6,439
- Transport (road, rail and air): 6,521
- Maritime and Waterfront: 2,491
- Commerce: 5,414
- Public Administration Offices: 6,162
- Others: 10,806

These workers served the following employers:
- Government: 25,369; Native administrations: 2,994; Service Departments (civilian employees of War Department and Admiralty): 408; and major private and commercial undertakings: 18,453.

In addition an estimated 35,000 workers were employed by smaller employers i.e. of less than six persons. During 1959 the average monthly figure of all workers in wage-earning employment was approximately 80,000.

There were, at the end of 1959, 12 registered trade unions; these, including one employer's union with 18 members, had a total membership of 25,295.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piassava, rice, cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, cassava, benniseed, kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is:
- cattle: 150,000,
- goats: 21,500,
- sheep: 10,000,
- pigs: 5,000.

The main timber products are sawn timber, shingles, roundwood, firewood, charcoal and gum copal. Sawn timber is not available for export but small quantities of gum copal and charcoal are exported.

Inshore fishing by African fishermen is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown and the Protectorate. The operation of commercial trawlers from Sierra Leone in recent years has contributed significantly to the local supply of fish.

The chief minerals mined are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Small quantities of gold are also found. Other minerals known to occur in Sierra Leone are platinum, ilmenorutile, lignite, cassiterite, molybdenite and bauxite.

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board continue to operate all pioneer oil mills in Sierra Leone. Because of inadequate fruit supplies, some mills have had to close down, though there was some improvement during 1959.

The Board has recently formulated plans for the development of oil palm plantations and the introduction of more efficient milling capacity.

The plan envisages the development of a plantation established at Waterloo by the Department of Agriculture; and of two new plantations at Sahn-Malen and Kasse. It also intends to establish two further plantations probably in the Northern and South Eastern Provinces in due course.

The rice milling capacity of the country has been improved by the erection of two modern mills at Kissy and at Torma. The installations include mechanical drying and parboiling plants, and silo storage.

Sierra Leone's economy is beginning to expand into the lighter manufacturing industries. Cigarette and nail factories are now in production and also a factory producing acetylene and oxygen gases. The installation of a plant for the manufacture of carbon dioxide is very near completion.

Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise. With the rapid expansion of the building trade, the activities of the furniture industry have increased significantly and the standard of work turned out is high.

(*—provisional figures)
Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There is an active co-operative movement in Sierra Leone principally organized into agricultural producers' marketing societies, and rural thrift and credit societies of unlimited liability. The movement has considerably expanded in the last few years, and is intended to play a major part in the future retail and produce trade of the country.

In 1960 there were 416 co-operatives with a total membership of 25,000 (through their families affecting some quarter-million people), a share capital of £48,000 and deposits and reserves of £61,000. The value of produce marketed through co-operatives was £486,200.

Marketing societies handle cocoa, coffee, palm kernels, rice, fish and cattle; the largest group are the 162 cocoa and coffee societies which are organized into 4 unions and a Federation operating transport services for their members—the Federation is an agent of the Produce Marketing Board and handles all "co-operative" cocoa (45% of the country's crop). In 1959-60, for the first time, the Federation also handled co-operative coffee (20% of the crop), making direct sales overseas. Another large group is the 43 rice marketing societies (with 2 unions, operating launch transport) which includes three mechanised rice cultivation societies. These formerly operated 22 petrol wheeled tractors, but are in the process of changing over to diesel crawlers.

The 163 thrift and credit societies are the most successful "pure" co-operatives in the country, and the value of their work in community development, the building of locally-constructed roads, operating schools and even in maternity welfare work, is very considerable. They are now developing a system of supervisors paid by unions, in order to lessen their dependence on the Co-operative Department, and to cope with illiteracy problems among village secretaries. They also market small quantities of agricultural produce.

Rural medium- and short-term credit is provided by the Government guaranteed Registrar's (bank overdraft) Loan Fund to the extent of £245,000. Of this about £120,000 is used for short-term credit, and £60,000 for financing cocoa and coffee buying, although the banks also make available advances to the extent of 60% of the value of produce purchased. The record of repayment of loans is excellent and as a result a building loans scheme has now been approved to be operated through co-operatives, as well as long-term loans for firm extension work.
