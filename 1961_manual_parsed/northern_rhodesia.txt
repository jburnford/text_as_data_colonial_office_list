NORTHERN RHODESIA
(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.)

Area
The Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia lies on the plateau of Central Africa. Its area is 288,130 square miles, including 3,000 square miles of inland water.

Population
The estimated population at 30th June 1960 was as follows:

| Race          | Population |

Geographical Features
With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000–5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 726 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.
Climate

There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°–100°, but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.

History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. de Lacerda, who led an expedition to Chief Kasembe’s capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in 1798. Though he died before reaching his goal, his diaries provide the first authoritative account of what is now north-eastern Rhodesia. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty’s Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be, and on 17th October 1900 the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika’s dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed, and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company, but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company’s administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company, and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three territories comprised in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 131). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, whose present membership is shown on page 138.

The Governor presides over an Executive Council of ten Ministers of whom four are officials (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Native Affairs); the six unofficial Ministers include two Africans. Each Minister, whether official or unofficial, is responsible for a group of departments. The Legislative Council contains a Speaker and 30 Members, of whom six are officials and two are nominated by the Governor. The remaining 22 Members were elected in single-member geographical constituencies on a two-tier qualitative franchise containing voters of all races. Two of the seats must, however, be filled by Africans, and two others by Europeans; in the elections to the two reserved European seats and those to 12 of the remaining seats (those representing the main areas of European settlement) the weight to be accorded to votes cast by voters on the lower tier of the franchise is limited to one-third of the votes actually cast by voters on the higher tier. The main features of the constitution are that all elected Members of the Legislative Council are returned by and become responsible

to a multi-racial electorate; each qualified voter may vote twice, once for a Member in a reserved seat and once for another Member, and at least one of his two votes will always count in full.

**Land Policy**

Land in the Territory, apart from Barotseland, is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land in a municipality is alienated by Head Lease to the Local Authority which in turn sub-lets to an approved applicant. Crown Land in a township is alienated by direct lease from the Crown but subject to the recommendation of the Local Authority. Crown Land for agricultural purposes is alienated on leasehold tenure to applicants who prove that they have the necessary finance and farming experience to make full use of the land. Under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands Ordinance the lessee of declared agricultural land may obtain a conditional freehold title to his farm on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down by the Ordinance. There is in certain areas freehold land which was granted in the early days.

**Taxation**

The Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of income tax and customs and excise duties on the 1st April 1954.

Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 10s. and £1 per annum. There are, in addition, certain levies generally varying between 2s. and £1 per annum made by Native Authorities.

**Public Finance**

The establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the 23rd October 1953 resulted in considerable changes in the Territory's financial responsibilities and arrangements. To conform with the Federal Government's financial year, which runs from the 1st July to the 30th June, the Territory's accounts were not closed on the 31st December 1953, the financial period being extended to the 30th June 1954.

The Territory retained its full revenue and met its full recurrent expenditure up to the 31st December 1953. For the six months period ended the 30th June 1954, revenue to which the Federal Government had become entitled was collected on behalf of that Government and paid over, except that the Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of Income Tax and Customs and Excise Duties on the 1st April 1954. With effect from the 1st January 1954 the Federal Government assumed full financial responsibility for the Departments which it was due to take over, and refunded to the Northern Rhodesia Government the full cost of administering them. The figures in the following table relating to the first six months of 1954 are not, therefore, comparable with those in succeeding years, as both revenue and expenditure totals include figures resulting from the settlements between the two Governments. The principal Departments and services taken over by the Federal Government in 1954 were as follows:

| Department                  | Revenue(1) | Expenditure(2) |
|-----------------------------|------------|---------------|
| 1938                        | 1,581,229  | 1,413,226     |

| 1958–59                     | 16,652,086 | 14,804,802    |
| 1959–60                     | 16,721,765 | 16,204,820    |

Expenditure up to 1957–58 included the following appropriations:

| Year   | Reserve Fund | Development Fund | Capital Fund |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1938   | 270,000      | —                | —            |

| 1954   | —            | 1,250,000        | —            |
| 1955–56| —            | —                | 3,904,000    |
| 1956–57| —            | —                | 2,000,000    |
| 1957–58| —            | —                | 2,379,000    |

From 1958–59 appropriations to the Capital Fund have been made from the General Revenue Balance only, as follows:

| Year   | Amount       |
|--------|--------------|
| 1958–59| 2,500,000    |
| 1959–60| 1,000,000    |

(1) Excluding grants from Colonial Development and Welfare Vote and Appropriations.

(2) Excluding Development Fund, Colonial Development and Welfare Expenditure.

(3) The Financial Period extended over 18 months, from 1st January 1953 to 30th June 1954.

(4) An appropriation of £3,290,000 was also transferred from the General Revenue Balance to the Development Fund.
(5) An appropriation of £1,622,090 was also transferred from the General Revenue Balance to the Capital Fund.

(6) Established 1st July 1955 replacing the former Development Fund.

(7) An appropriation of £447,213 was also transferred from the General Revenue Balance to the Capital Fund.

(8) An appropriation of £2,084,277 was also transferred from the General Revenue Balance to the Capital Fund.

The Public Debt of Northern Rhodesia as at 30th June 1960 was as in table below, responsibility for servicing and repaying a substantial portion having been assumed by the Federal Government.

Currency

Up to the 23rd April 1957 the currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The denominations were 10s., £1, £5 and £10 notes, cupro-nickel or copper halfpennies and pennies and cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns.

On the 23rd April 1957, however, the Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which took over the assets of the Central Africa Currency Board on the 1st April 1956, commenced the issue of new currency notes of the denominations of 10s., £1, £5 and £10. The two types of currency now circulate together, but the new will gradually replace the old as the latter becomes unfit for circulation. As from the 1st January 1955 British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Development Plans

The Northern Rhodesia Government’s Development Plan of 1957–61 was reviewed early in 1959 and replaced by the second four year plan covering the period from 1st July 1959 to 30th June 1963. The period covered by the first two years of the

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

At 30th June 1960 there were 59 Government European schools and 12 Government-aided private schools providing education for European children. Ten of the Government schools and one private school provided education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard. Post-Certificate education up to the Cambridge Higher Certificate is provided at nine of the Government Secondary Schools. Nine of the Government Schools have hostel accommodation catering for nearly 1,000 children.

The enrolment in European Government schools was 15,649; in Government-aided and private schools, 1,999. Technical education for apprentices is provided by the Copperbelt Technical Foundation at Kitwe, Luanshya, Mufulira and Chingola and by the Federal Government at Ndola, Broken Hill, Lusaka and Livingstone. The Foundation operates under the aegis of the mines with assistance from the Ministry of Education. Government assistance in the form of bursaries, loans, scholarships and grants is available under certain conditions for higher education. Pupils from Northern Rhodesia attend the Training College for teachers at Heany, near Bulawayo, and the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland at Salisbury.

There are 18 Government schools for Asians and Coloureds (a total of 2,174 children). Two of these schools have hostel accommodation. There is also one Government-aided private school for Asian and Coloured pupils.

No exact figures are available for the number of African children in each age group. It is estimated that in the primary school age group (7 years to 14 years inclusive) there are approximately 430,000 children, of whom 62% are in school. In the secondary age group (15-19 years) there are estimated to be 170,000 children. Of these 5,142 are either in secondary schools or undergoing some form of vocational training at schools or colleges aided or maintained by the Ministry of African Education.

The enrolment in the various types of schools in September 1959 was:

| African Schools | No. of schools | No. of pupils, etc. |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools | 1,541 | 262,073 |
| Unaided primary schools | 31 | 3,404 |
| Secondary schools | 18 | 2,108 |
| Teacher training schools | 13 | 1,218 |
| Trades schools | 20 | 1,403 |
| Other vocational schools (girls) | 20 | 413 |

There were three post-secondary courses in operation (with some 97 pupils) namely a Sixth Form at Munali Secondary School and two courses at the Chalimbana Teacher Training College, one for the training of teachers for the upper primary schools and one for training junior secondary school teachers. Bursaries are awarded by both the Federal Government and the Northern Rhodesia Government for students to attend various courses of advanced education. In September 1960 there were 54 such students in Africa and the United Kingdom. There were also 14 students attending courses in the United Kingdom and the United States on Commonwealth and U.S.A. grants.

Recurrent expenditure on African education is given below.

| Year | Expenditure |
|------|-------------|
| 1938 | £32,740     |
| 1945 | £149,450    |
| 1953 | £642,834    |
| 1954 | £853,822    |
| July, 1954–June, 1955 | £1,054,675 |
| July, 1955–June, 1956 | £1,717,158* |

| July, 1958–June, 1959 | £1,843,845 |
| July, 1959–June, 1960 | £2,130,047 |

* Includes £460,000 for starting the Unified African Teaching Service pension scheme.

Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.

The Institute, with headquarters at Lusaka, has conducted social research in British Central Africa since 1938. While emphasis is placed on the study of the reaction of African peoples to modern social and economic conditions, research into the problems of the immigrant races is also undertaken.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia's National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times. The library contains approximately 5,000 volumes which are available to members of the Northern Rhodesia Society.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

Public health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

Government medical facilities in the Territory include two central hospitals, situated at Lusaka and Kitwe, offering facilities for all races. General hospitals at Livingstone, Broken Hill and Ndola offer restricted facilities for all races. There are also 15 district hospitals, with a medical officer in attendance, and 23 rural hospitals.
In addition to the hospital facilities described above, there are 140 rural health centres and 33 urban clinics.

During 1959, a total of 142,164 patients were admitted to hospital. Attendances of outpatients totalled 6,984,873.

A new block for the general hospital at Livingstone was completed late in 1959, and there are plans for a new central hospital at Ndola, a new block for the central hospital at Lusaka, and a mental hospital, also at Lusaka.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and certain other aspects of communications.

There are main airports at Livingstone, Lusaka and Ndola with bituminous surfaced runways and one at Kasama with gravel runway, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. Subsidiary airfields serve most of the outlying districts.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo border (near Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 655 miles.

The total mileage of maintained roads in the Territory at 31st December 1959 was 19,777-2, made up as follows:

| Miles          |
|----------------|
| Inter-territorial main roads | 1,928-2 |
| Territorial main roads       | 1,887-3 |
| District roads               | 13,511-7 |
| Native Authority roads       | 2,450-0 |

There are 678-3 miles of Class 1 (bituminous surface) standard. This total includes main roads through townships.

The Zambezi River Transport Service Board of Control operates a passenger and goods service along the Zambezi River from Livingstone to Mongu. The first portion of the route is by road to Mambova on the Zambezi River from which point power barges operate to Katima Mulilo. The remainder of the route is covered by road vehicles running on roads in close proximity to the river. During 1959 the service carried 4,430 tons of goods traffic and 12,555 passengers.

Broadcasting

All broadcasting in the Federation is undertaken by the Federal Broadcasting Corporation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a statutory body created by the Broadcasting Act of 1957.

The Corporation has three services, i.e., the General Service (English), the Commercial Service (English) and the African Service.

There are studios in Lusaka, Salisbury, Bulawayo, Blantyre and Kitwe and programmes are broadcast on medium and shortwave transmitters situated in the major centres of the Federation.

The total hours broadcast in the African Service is 104 per week and these programmes are transmitted in English and eight vernaculars: Nyanja, Bemba, Tonga, Lozi, Lunda and Luvale for Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Shona and Sindebele for Southern Rhodesia. English is the medium for three hours each weekday and for eight hours each Sunday. There is simultaneous broadcasting in two languages between 4.00 and 8.00 p.m. daily.

It is estimated that there are over 100,000 wireless owners amongst the African people and that some 500,000 look to the FBC for their information and entertainment.

News is brought to the listeners in English and in eight vernaculars in the 20 daily bulletins broadcast in the African Service.

Main Crops and Products
The main crops are maize, tobacco and groundnuts. Small quantities of rice, cotton, pulses, citrus, potatoes, tropical fruits, vegetables, wheat and beeswax are also produced.

| Main Crops—Production |
|-----------------------|
| **African**           |
| Maize—000 tons       | 45·9 |
| Groundnuts—000 tons  | 7·4  |
| Tobacco—000 lbs      | 88·0 |
| **European**         |
| Maize—000 tons       | 111·9 |
| *Tobacco—million lbs.| 1·68 |

In 1959 the approximate number of cattle owned by Europeans was 179,074. African owned livestock totalled 955,000 cattle, 135,000 sheep and goats and 50,000 pigs. Over 40,000 head of cattle were slaughtered during the year.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru, and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is transported to line-of-rail centres, either dry or preserved on ice. Fishing is being stimulated on the Southern Sector of Lakes Tanganyika and Kariba.

Output of sawlogs, poles, and firewood amounted to 416,162 tons in 1959.

Mineral Production in 1959

| Weight | Approximate Value |
|--------|-------------------|
| Gold   | 4,704 oz. £57,777 |
| Silver | 948,459 oz. £303,561 |
| Cobalt | 210,140 cwt. £3,198,310 |
| Copper (blister) | 165,535 tons £34,944,075 |
| Copper (electrolytic) | 364,595 tons £82,089,094 |
| Copper (other) | 1,512 tons £273,269 |

A large variety of products is now being manufactured in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, tiles, furniture, steel finishing work, beer, mineral waters, metal castings and nuts and bolts.

* Excludes Western area flue cured Virginia tobacco which is sold unidentified on the Salisbury auction floors.

Trade
With the assumption by the Federal Government in 1954 of the control of imports and of the promotion and control of exports, no separate figures for Northern Rhodesia are available. Statistics are, however, published in the "Annual Statement of External Trade" compiled by the Central Statistical Office for the whole Federation.

Secondary industry continues to expand in the Territory and whereas producers relied in the past mainly on the internal market for the consumption of their products, the field is now widening to embrace the export market, with the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, East Africa, Mozambique and to some extent the Congo, participating in a two-way trade.

Industrial products cover an ever widening range, and include steel finishing work and metal castings, sawmilling, cement products, soap, furniture, oxygen and acetylene, which have long been established. More recent additions are clothing and blanket factories, an iron foundry, a brewery, a sweet factory and sugar refinery.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations
The steady growth of the co-operative movement continued during 1959, and 20 new societies were registered.

The total number of societies registered at the 31st December 1959 was 245 with a European and African aggregate membership of 33,421. Paid-up share capital and deposits amounted to £519,543. Combined turnover of all societies amounted to £6,542,108.

The principal products handled were maize, wheat, beans, cowpeas, sunhemp, sunflower, kaffir corn, millet, cassava, groundnuts, rice, potatoes, fruit, vegetables, cotton, Virginia, Burley and Turkish tobacco, milk, cream, cheese, butter, eggs, and dried fish.

Thrift societies continue to become increasingly popular and important in the urban areas and seven new societies were registered during 1959. Primary producer societies are becoming increasingly important and eight new societies were registered in 1959.
