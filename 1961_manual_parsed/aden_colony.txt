ADEN COLONY

Area

Aden Colony is situated about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia. The area is 75 square miles (exclusive of Perim and the Kuria Muria Islands, the areas of which are 5 square miles and 28 square miles respectively).

Population

At the census taken in 1955 the total population recorded was 138,441:

| Population       | Per cent |
|------------------|----------|
| Arabs            | 75.2     |

| Europeans        | 3.2      |
| Others           | 1.9      |

Principal Towns

| Town                        | Population |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Aden (including Tawahi, Maala, Crater, Khormaksar) | 99,285     |
| Sheikh Othman               | 29,879     |
| Little Aden                 | 9,277      |

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas, joined by a flat sandy foreshore, comprising:

(a) The peninsula on which are situated the main town known as Crater, the wharf and shipyard area of Maala, the modern harbour suburb known as Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased to the Air Ministry for R.A.F. and military purposes and known collectively as Steamer Point.

(b) The isthmus known as Khormaksar where a large R.A.F. station is situated.

(c) The strip of mainland between the two peninsulas which encloses the modern harbour and contains the township of Sheikh Othman and the villages of Hiswa and Imad.

(d) The Little Aden peninsula where a modern refinery has been constructed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited and where the two fishing villages of Bureika and Fukum lie.

The Island of Perim, and the Kuria Muria Islands off the Dhufar Coast of Oman, also form part of the Colony.

Climate

The climate is not unhealthy, though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent, but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

History

The plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden led to the capture of Aden by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company in 1839 under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy.

The need to establish coaling stations on trade routes because of the replacement of sailing ships by steamers was one of the reasons which led to the occupation of Aden by the British. Little Aden was obtained by purchase in 1868. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the Island the same year. It was later re-occupied by the British in January 1857.

The five Kuria Muria Islands were ceded to the United Kingdom in 1854 by the Sultan of Oman for purposes of a cable station.

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden from 1st April, 1937.

Constitution

By Additional Royal Instructions issued in November 1958, the following changes in the composition of the Executive Council of the Colony have become effective:

The Executive Council now consists of five ex officio members (who must include the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, and a representative of the Senior Officer of the Forces stationed in the Colony), and also five persons who are Elected Members or Nominated Members of the Legislative Council, but not less than three of whom shall be Elected Members, selected and appointed by the Governor who are styled Members in Charge.

There is provision for the Governor to assign to individual Members in Charge responsibility for matters which he may prescribe at his discretion.

Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, a Legislative Council was constituted consisting of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than four official members and not more than eight unofficial members. The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1955, provided for the introduction of an elected element into the Legislative Council. Under this Order the Council consisted of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than five nominated official members, not more than five nominated unofficial members, and four elected members.

The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1958, provided for a Legislative Council consisting of a Speaker, five ex officio members, twelve elected members, and six nominated members. The first elections under the provisions of this Order took place on 4th January 1959.
The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1959, restricts the application of the Aden Colony Order, 1936, as amended in relation to the Island of Perim and the Kuria Muria Islands, for the Government of which provision is made by the Perim Order in Council, 1959, and the Kuria Muria Islands Order in Council, 1959. These islands, while remaining part of the Colony, are no longer included among the responsibilities of the Colony Legislative and Executive Councils but are administered directly by the Governor, through a Commissioner in each case. Legislative power is vested in the Governor.

**Land Policy**

Under the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1945, the Governor is empowered to lease or otherwise alienate in Her Majesty's behalf any Crown Land for building, agricultural or any other purpose, on any terms and conditions, as he may think fit.

**Taxation**

Aden is a free port and there is no general Customs tariff, but taxes are levied on alcoholic liquor, tobacco, motor spirit, qat and aerated waters. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for the payment of a graduated tax by individuals ranging from 4 per cent. to 75 per cent. on chargeable income. Companies pay at the rate of 32½ per cent.

**Development Plans**

The 1955–60 Development Plan ended on 31st March 1960. Expenditure under that Plan had been as follows:

| Service          | Expenditure |
|------------------|-------------|
| Social Services  | £2,296,957  |
| Communications   | £947,263    |
| Public Utilities | £2,431,165  |
| Housing          | £1,678,271  |
| Miscellaneous    | £1,443,273  |

£1,684,655 of that expenditure had been incurred before 31st March 1955 and a total of £7,117,832 was spent during the 5 year period. Since 1947 when the first post-war Development Plan was introduced a total of £10,450,000 has been spent on development together with a project costing £4 million for the capital Township works at Little Aden where a new Oil Refinery was built.

A new Development Plan for the period 1960–64 was approved by the Legislative Council during 1960 and provides for expenditure as follows:

| Service                  | Expenditure |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Education                | £550,000    |

| Miscellaneous            | £694,000    |
| Residual 1955–60 Schemes | £484,974    |

£5,845,000

There is also a project to spend £550,000 from Electricity Department funds on increased generating capacity.

The Development Plan is being financed through the Development Fund which obtains its resources by transfers from General Revenue, Loans and Colonial Development and Welfare grants. For the period 1960–64 it is planned that £1,450,000 will come from General Revenue, £1 million from Colonial Development and Welfare grants, £274,000 from contributions from other Authorities, £2,626,000 from Loans and there is an opening balance of nearly £500,000.

**Education**

Education in Aden is under the administrative control of a Director, who also advises on education in the Eastern and Western Protectorates. On 1st October 1959 there were in the Colony 7,395 pupils (4,842 boys and 2,553 girls) in Government schools, 4,107 pupils (2,660 boys and 1,447 girls) in grant-aided schools, and some 2,432 pupils (2,253 boys and 179 girls) in private schools. In addition there are numerous unrecognized groups of children attending Koranic schools. The educational system consists of four years of primary, three years of intermediate and four to six years of secondary schooling. Secondary education is almost entirely in the hands of Government, which has provided three fine colleges for the purpose: Aden College, which prepares boys for the examinations of the London University General Certificate of Education at ordinary and advanced levels; the Technical Institute, where courses in carpentry and joinery, machine-shop engineering, automobile engineering and electrical engineering are given—leading to the City and Guilds of London Institute examinations—as well as clerical training courses; and the Girls' College, where all pupils receive an education up to intermediate level and selected girls who successfully complete the intermediate course pass on to the secondary section of the College. The Teacher Training Centre offers a one- to two-year course of training for newly recruited teachers as well as teachers already in service. Provision is also made for training teachers from the Aden Protectorates. There is also a Teacher Training Centre for women.

The Technical Institute offers courses in various technical subjects both at Aden and at Little Aden. Adult evening classes are also provided by the Education Department.
There are at present 90 men and women on scholarships in the United Kingdom.

The expenditure on Colony education has risen from £6,600 in 1936 to £447,266 in 1959-60.

Libraries

The Lake Library, administered by the Aden Municipality, contains 19,645 books in English, Arabic and Urdu and has about 1,000 members. A Travelling Library with 4,626 volumes in English and Arabic has 461 members. There are well-stocked and expanding libraries at Aden College, the Technical Institute, and the Girls' College. Amenities for the teaching profession include a club with a library of over 2,000 volumes.

Health

The principal causes of ill-health and disability in Aden fall under the following headings:

- Respiratory Diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia,
- Road Accidents,
- Gastro-intestinal disturbances.

The following hospital beds are available:

- Queen Elizabeth (Civil) Hospital 495 beds
- Maternity Clinic 60 beds, 54 cots
- Home for Aged Persons 56 beds
- Infectious Diseases Hospital 38 beds
- Keith Falconer Mission Hospital (Church of Scotland) 73 beds, 3 private rooms, 8 cots
- B.P. Refinery Hospital 70 beds

In 1959 in-patients and out-patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital totalled 7,615 and 33,368, respectively. There are six Government dispensaries including two seamen's dispensaries, and an out-patients department at Crater. Attendances at these Institutions totalled 410,205. There are two charitable dispensaries whose attendance figures totalled 162,613.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1959-60 was £475,671, compared with £13,230 in 1936.

Communications

Aden Civil Airport is situated at Khormaksar, seven miles from Steamer Point, and operated on a continuous 24-hour basis, air navigational and all other facilities being provided jointly by the Royal Air Force and the Civil Aviation Department. There are some 19 aerodromes and landing strips within the Protectorate of which 10 are in regular use by Aden Airways Limited on their domestic services network.

Nine airlines operate regular international trunk route services to and through Aden Civil Airport; Aden Airways, Air-India International, Alitalia, B.O.A.C., East African Airways Corporation, Ethiopian Air Lines, Middle East Airlines, Misr Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Sudan Airways. These services connect the Colony direct with Africa, Asia, Europe, the Mediterranean and Middle East countries and the Persian Gulf.

Traffic making use of the terminal and other facilities has more than trebled since the civil terminal came into being in 1952.

The Colony has a total of 112.2 miles of roads, of which 99.7 are bituminous macadam surfaced. There are no railways.

The vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and the number of vessels, exclusive of country craft, which entered the Port of Aden during 1959 was 5,742 with a tonnage of 26,017,284. The number of country craft which entered the Port during the same period was 1,570 with an aggregate tonnage of 134,350. The first-class berths are suitable for ships of from 350-800 feet in length. The second-class berths are suitable for ships of about 300 feet in length. Thirteen of the first-class berths are fitted with submarine pipelines for fuelling ships. There is also an 800 feet long quay with a depth alongside of 18 feet, suitable for coasting vessels of up to 2,500 tons gross. Transit and storage sheds on the public wharves provide a total covered space of 400,000 sq. feet. The approach channel is dredged to 36 feet, and three of the largest fuelling berths are dredged to 39 feet. The Oil Harbour at Little Aden has four jetty berths, the approach channel being dredged to 38 feet and the Oil Harbour to 40 feet.

Broadcasting

The Aden Broadcasting Service, a part of the Public Relations and Information Department, was inaugurated in 1954 and transmits for 11 hours daily in Arabic on short wave 41.8 metres and medium wave 375 metres. The transmitters now in use are 74kW. and 5kW. respectively, and are situated at Hiswa. It is estimated that about 30,000 receivers are in use in the Colony and a similar number in the Protectorate.

Principal Occupations

Of the estimated local labour force of 62,000, some 5,000 are engaged in Port activities such as bunkering, handling of cargo, ship repairing, manning harbour vessels, and so forth; 10,000 in building and construction, 1,700 in oil refining, 7,000 in retail and distributive trades, 12,000 in Government and Services Departments, and 21,000 in the hotel and catering trade and in private domestic service.

Main Products

There is no agriculture in the Colony and the only important local product is salt which is made from sea water by solar evaporation. Production in 1959 was 175,000 long tons.

There is a developing inshore fishing industry primarily engaged in tunny, kingfish and carangid fisheries. Production is increasing due to introduction of mechanized boats and better fishing gear. Annual landings are estimated at 5,000 tons for a good season and catches are disposed of through fresh-fish markets (about 1,000 tons) and surplus through the Salt and Dried Fish Exporters.

The oil refinery at Little Aden produces refined petroleum from imported crude oil.

In July 1960 the Refinery had been in commission for six years and in that time had processed over 20 million tons of crude oil. The products were exported either by tanker or as fuel for ships' bunkers; a small percentage was retained in Aden to meet local demand.

Because of its favourable geographical position and its efficient service to ships, Aden has become one of the busiest oil bunkering ports in the world.

There are small factories in the Colony which produce soft drinks, aluminium pots and pans, cigarettes, dyed and printed cloth, and wooden furniture. There is a small but flourishing industry for the blending and packing of perfumes, hair oil and toilet waters; a modern mechanical mill...
crushes oilseeds. Some of the Colony produce is sold locally and some is exported to neighbouring territories.

* Include ships' stores and bunkers.

The trade of Aden is mainly transhipment and entrepôt, the port serving as a centre of distribution to and from neighbouring territories. Traditional trade is mainly in textiles, gums and resins, grains and flour, coffee, tea, hides and skins, raw cotton and cottonseed, and cheap consumer goods. There is also trade in dates, sugar, spices, oils, tobacco and shells, and a flourishing trade in luxury goods such as cameras, watches, binoculars and cosmetics, which are sold to passengers coming ashore from ships refuelling in Aden Harbour.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A large new Central Wholesale Produce Market was opened at Khormaksar in 1959; its purpose is to rationalize the wholesaling of fruit and vegetables in the interests of both the producers in the Protectorate and the consumers in the Colony. The Market is administered by an Authority established under the provisions of The Produce Marketing Ordinance, 1958.

The Co-operative and Marketing Department has introduced co-operation to the fishermen in Colony waters, amongst whom two societies have been formed, and to other sections of the community. A Co-operative Societies Ordinance has been enacted.

PROTECTORATE

Area

The total area is approximately 111,000 square miles, including the Island of Socotra. The Protectorate is divided into Western and Eastern Areas.

Population is estimated at:

Western Area ... ... 355,000
Eastern Area ... ... 305,000
Total ... ... 660,000

Towns

There are no large towns in the Western Aden Protectorate but in the Eastern Protectorate Mukalla, the sea port, has a population of some 20,000.

Geographical Features

The Aden Protectorate is bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen, and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges, about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains, over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Empty Quarter with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate also has a littoral belt, which is backed by a rock plateau rising to a height of 6,000 feet and continuing inland for about 100 miles, where it breaks up into a system of wadis, some fertile, leading into the main Wadi Hadhramaut. Beyond, to the north, are the sands of the Empty Quarter.

Climate

The altitude, which ranges from sea level up to 8,000 feet, is responsible for considerable variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. On the coastal plain torrid tropical conditions of great heat and humidity exist in the summer months. During the same period in the mid-altitude zones it is hot but less humid, while at the highest altitudes the climate is warm and temperate but can in the winter be extremely cold. The whole area falls within the influence of the northeast and south-west monsoons. Rainfall in the coastal areas averages approximately two inches a year; in the most favoured areas of the Western Aden Protectorate highlands it may average ten inches. In general, rainfall decreases from west to east until, in the north-east section, conditions of extreme aridity are encountered.

History

For a time in the eighteenth century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana’a in the Yemen and several of the rulers of the tribal districts were the Imam’s “wakils” or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with Her Majesty’s Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being in 1954.

In July 1915, during the first World War, the Turks, who had conquered the Yemen in the course of the previous century, occupied the Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts of the Protectorate until the Armistice of 1918.

In 1934 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Her Majesty’s Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen. There was an Exchange of Notes in 1951 when it was agreed to establish reciprocal diplomatic missions and to set up a Frontier Commission.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa’i Sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala) entered into closer relations with His Majesty’s Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of...
the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. Similar treaties were signed by the Upper Aulaqi Sheikh and the Audhali Sultan in 1952, and by the Sheikh of Shu'eib in 1954. In 1952 the newly elected Sultan of Lahej accepted a political officer as adviser.

On 11th February 1959 a Federation of six states in the Western Aden Protectorate, called the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South, was inaugurated and a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Federation. The six federated states were the Emirates of Beihan and Dhala, the Fadhli, Audhali and Lower Yafa'i Sultanates, and the Upper Aulaqi Sheikdom. The treaty extended Her Majesty's protection to the Federation and provided for military and financial assistance to the Federation. It also provided for the possibility of other states in the Protectorate acceding to the Federation (see Cmdn. 665). The Sultanate of Lahej acceded to the Federation in October 1959 followed by the Dathina, the Lower Aulaqi Sultanate and the Aqrabi Sheikdom in February 1960.

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri Sultans and the rise of the Qu'aiti—a new Yafa'i dynasty which gained power and wealth from military and other services rendered by its members abroad to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu'aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with Her Majesty's Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri Sultan made an agreement with the Qu'aiti Sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu'aiti and Kathiri Sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British resident adviser in all matters except those concerning Mohammedan religion and custom. The Wahidi Sultan of Balhaf signed an Advisory Treaty in 1949, and a similar treaty was signed by the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra in 1954.

Administration

Her Majesty's Government does not administer the Protectorate directly but the British Advisory Staff advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas.

In the Western Aden Protectorate the States nominate their own heads, who have subsequently to be recognized by the Governor of Aden. Not all the heads of the States and tribal chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery and in several States an efficient administration is now functioning. There are now State Councils in Lower Yafa'i, Amiri, Lower Aulaqi, Shu'eib, Fadhli, Dathina, Beihan and Upper Aulaqi and there is a Legislative Council in Lahej. The Federation of Arab Emirates of the South has a legislative body called the Federal Council; the executive authority is exercised by the Supreme Council, made up of the Ministers of the Federation. For internal security some of the States raised Tribal Guards, partly paid by Her Majesty's Government. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force called the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate. Within the Federation the Government Guards and the Tribal Guards of the Federated States have now been amalgamated into one force known as the Federal National Guard. The Minister of Internal Security is responsible to the Supreme Council for the control of this force.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal States are the Qu'aiti and Kathiri which are administered by their Sultans as constitutional rulers and have State Councils. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the supervision of the Resident Adviser and British Agent, Eastern Aden Protectorate. The island of Socotra is linked administratively with the mainland territory of Qishn under the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra.

Land Policy

Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenous inhabitants. The local State Governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trusts (waqfs). Land settlement is in progress in the Abyan area, Western Protectorate.

Taxation

The bulk of revenue collected by the Protectorate States comes from indirect taxes in the shape of Customs, excise and licence dues; in addition tithes are collected on agricultural products.

Development Plans

Between 1945 and 1958 the Aden Protectorate received allocations totalling £1,720,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. Under the 1959 Act, a further £1,000,000 has been allocated for the three-year period up to 1962. Of the former sum, the major part has been spent on agriculture, communications, education and health; lesser amounts have been made available for co-operation and marketing, fisheries and information services. It is proposed that development planning shall in future be undertaken on a regional basis, and it is to be expected that the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South and the other States of the Protectorate will play an important part in the shaping of plans.

The largest development scheme, that in Abyan initiated in 1947, aims to achieve a better use of land and water resources, and has developed at a satisfactory rate in all fields where adequate staff, machinery and materials could be mustered. The scheme is administered by the Abyan Board, consisting of representatives of the two States in the Abyan Area, with Governmental advice available, and which works in partnership with landowners and owner-occupiers or tenant farmers. Cotton is grown as a main crop and marketed by the Board. An area of approximately 50,000 acres is now controlled for irrigation farming out of an estimated gross area of 120,000 acres.

Other Development

The Qu'aiti State has allocated money to a total amount of £325,000 for development schemes throughout the State; the original allocation of £75,000 was, and is still being, used for promoting agriculture in the Wadi Hadhramaut by lift irrigation and flood control. Among the development projects now under consideration are harbour improvement, hospital improvement, the purchase of modern machinery to maintain roads, a fisheries scheme and the setting up of a Technical College. The Kathiri State has £30,000 allocated for agricultural development.

Education in the States varies greatly in development, the Qu'aiti State being at present the most advanced. It has three Government intermediate schools with a further one of intermediate status; of these, all of which consist of four post-primary standards, two have been in existence for some time while two are of recent foundation—the one in Mukalla being opened in 1958 and the one in Shihr in 1959. An intermediate School of a similar type was opened in Seiyun in 1958, thus supplementing the post-primary education facilities in the Wadi Hadhramaut which has hitherto been confined to a two-standard private school in Tarim. About 500 boys are receiving post-primary education in these intermediate Schools. Secondary education is catered for either in Aden or the Sudan by scholarships and a small Teachers Training School at Ghail Ba-Wazir, operating a one-year's course, prepares post-intermediate students for primary teaching. Secondary and post-intermediate students from the Western Aden Protectorate attend a similar course operating in the Aden Colony to prepare them for intermediate and primary teaching. There are six intermediate schools in the Western Aden Protectorate, two at Lahej, in the Abdali State, one at Zinjibar, in the Fadhli State, one at Ja'ar, Lower Yafai State, one at Lodar, Audhali State, and one at Mudia, Dathina State. They all follow the Colony syllabus. There are about 500 boys at these schools. Below this level there are about 90 primary (or lower than primary) schools with a total of some 4,000 boys. This does not include small Koranic schools which are found in many places, nor the private schools of strongly religious bias, of which there are more than 30 in the Wadi Hadhramaut alone.

Girls' education is of fairly recent development. There are now ten schools following the primary syllabus—two at Mukalla, one at Seiyun, four in the Fadhli State, one at Ja'ar, Lower Yafai State, one at Mudia, Dathina State, and one at Lahej, Abdali State—with a total of about 900 girls. In addition there are ten girls' schools and one mixed school of a lower level with about 700 girls. Most of these are in the Eastern Protectorate.

Expenditure on education for the years 1959–60 was £131,644 divided between the Eastern and Western Protectorates.

Health

A Health Adviser, Aden Protectorate, first appointed in 1951, directs the H.M.G. element of the Protectorate Health Service and advises the States elements. The former comprises advisory staff in the Eastern Protectorate and a small body of specialists serving both Protectorates. The States elements are the Ministry of Health of the Federation of the Arab Emirates of the South, covering all Western Protectorate health commitments, and in the East the well developed Qu'aiti and Kathiri Health Services and the smaller State Services of the Balhaf, Bir Ali and Mahri Sultanates which in fact are administered by the H.M.G. element. There are in all, 25 doctors in both Protectorates working in eight hospitals to which are linked some 76 rural health units. These are run by health assistants, literate in Arabic, derived from local inhabitants and trained in simple curative and preventive skills. There are two base hospitals to which are attached health services training centres for male and female sub-professional staff and mobile sanitation units. That for the Federal Service in the West is at Makhzan, in the Abyan area, that for the East is in Mukalla in the Qu'aiti State.

Communications

A regular air service by Aden Airways is maintained throughout the year between Aden and Mukeiras, and between Aden, Riyah (18 miles from Mukalla) and Ghuraf (14 miles from Seiyun) on a thrice-weekly service which also calls once a week at Al Qatn in the Wadi Hadhramaut. A weekly service is also maintained between Aden and Raudha in Wahidi country.

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate. Increasing use is being made of motor vehicles. These are for the most part driven along sandy beaches, dry river beds or across open desert, but several natural roads have been improved to take
motor traffic and in a few cases new roads have been cut through difficult country. Roads are extremely rough and surfaces are infrequently repaired. Routes for new and improved roads are being surveyed.

A coastal road in the Eastern Aden Protectorate runs from Reidat al Abdal Wadud in the east through Shihir, Mukalla, Bir Ali and Balhaf to connect with the Western Aden Protectorate. Roads run inland from Shihir and Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut and from near Balhaf to Azzan and Habban. The approximate total mileage of motorable tracks in the Eastern Aden Protectorate is 2,680 miles. The desert between the Wadi Hadhramaut and Beihan is also traversed by motors. Where these cannot yet penetrate the traffic is carried on camel caravans, which still travel to Aden from the Western Aden Protectorate and to Mukalla and Shihir from other parts of the Eastern Aden Protectorate in large numbers. Donkeys are also employed for both passengers and goods.

Sea communications along the coast of the Protectorate are mainly by dhows, some of which have auxiliary engines. Small powered craft and coastal steamers make occasional and irregular visits to Mukalla and Shihir from Aden.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture employs about 90 per cent. of the population; other occupations are fishing, dyeing, weaving, and preparation of hides and skins.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton (long staple), cotton seed, sorghum, millet, bulrush millet, dates, wheat, barley, sesame and Hamami tobacco. Secondary products are vegetables and citrus, and the export of hides and skins.

Cotton, first introduced into the Fadhli and Lower Yafa'i areas of the Western Protectorate in 1949, is now being grown in several States of the Western Protectorate and on a small scale in two of the States of the Eastern Protectorate. Lint production figures from the ginnery show a gross return over the last three years of approximately £1,301,000 per annum.

Production figures (statistical bales of 400 lb. cotton lint) are:

| Season     | Lint Production |
|------------|----------------|
| 1949–50    | 100            |
| 1950–51    | 1,587          |
| 1951–52    | 9,890          |
| 1952–53    | 11,161         |
| 1953–54    | 21,736         |
| 1954–55    | 22,140         |
| 1955–56    | 30,700         |
| 1956–57    | 28,310         |
| 1957–58    | 29,000         |
| 1958–59    | 18,806         |
| 1959–60    | 34,524         |

A rough estimate of the livestock population is:

- Camels: 46,500
- Cattle: 36,600
- Goats: 349,000
- Sheep: 13,000

The annual catch of wet fish has been estimated at 70,000 tons for a good season. At least 75 per cent. of this is taken in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. Most of the fish is cured for consumption inland and for export to East Africa and the Far East.

External Trade

The principal imports are grain, flour, rice, dates, sugar, sesame oil, tea, kerosene, spice, cloth, cotton piece-goods, tobacco, cigarettes, soap and glassware.

The principal exports are cotton, coffee, skins and hides, lime, Hamami tobacco, cattle, ghee, sheep, goats and fish.

The great bulk of trade with the Western Aden Protectorate goes by land from the town of Aden, and that with the Eastern Aden Protectorate goes by sea to the port of Mukalla. No reliable figures are available.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The marketing of cotton in the Protectorate is dealt with by the Abyan Board. It deals not only with the crops from lands within the area of the Board, but also with the cotton grown in other States in the Eastern and Western Protectorates. In several of these States, the local handling of the crop is now undertaken by cotton producers' associations, six of which have been established as a result of decrees by the States concerned. They may be regarded as embryo co-operative societies. A tobacco growers' credit co-operative has been established in the Eastern Protectorate. Three co-operative credit and marketing societies have been organized among the Western Protectorate fruit and vegetable farmers, to facilitate smooth evacuation and marketing of produce and to tackle the problem of the chronic indebtedness of producers to auctioneers and agents in Aden.

Encouragement and assistance is given to farmers by the Co-operative and Marketing Department in the transportation by air of an increasing amount of fresh produce from certain areas of the Protectorate.

KAMARAN ISLAND

The island of Kamaran in the Red Sea (area 22 square miles) has been in British occupation since 1915. It does not form part of either the Colony of Aden or the Aden Protectorate, but the Governor of Aden is also the Governor of Kamaran under the provisions of the Kamaran Order in Council, 1949. Prior to that the island was under the control of the Government of India, exercised through the Governor of Aden and a local Civil Administrator, whose designation became Commissioner in 1949. Until 1953 a Quarantine Station was run in Kamaran for pilgrims on their way to Jedda by sea. This has now been closed.

Expenditure on the administration of Kamaran in 1959–60 was £50,251, of which £45,855 was contributed by Her Majesty's Government.

The island has an airport and Aden Airways planes land there on scheduled services.
