TANGANYIKA

Area

The total area of the territory is 361,800 square miles, which includes 20,650 square miles of inland water. The land area (in square miles) of the nine Provinces and one Extra-provincial District into which Tanganyika is now divided is as follows:

| Province               | Square Miles |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Central               | 35,000       |
| Eastern               | 41,400       |
| Lake                  | 27,600       |
| West Lake             | 11,150       |
| Northern              | 33,100       |
| Southern              | 53,600       |
| Southern Highlands    | 44,800       |
| Tanga                 | 14,000       |
| Western               | 78,250       |
| Dar es Salaam Extra-provincial District | 50 |

(The areas as shown are approximations to the nearest 50 square miles.)

Population

In June 1960 the total population was estimated to be 9,237,600.

An estimate at mid-1960 showed that there were 9,098,000 Africans, 22,300 Europeans, 87,300 Indians and Goans, 25,400 Arabs and 4,600 others—total non-African population 139,600. Among the Africans some 120 tribes can be distinguished. Some of these number only a few thousand persons, while the largest tribe in the Territory, the Sukuma, numbers over one million. Other large tribes in numerical order are the Nyamwezi, Makonde, Haya, Chagga, Gogo and Ha. The ten largest tribes together comprise nearly half of the African population.

Geographical Features

The two extremes of topographical relief of the whole continent of Africa lie within the boundaries of the Territory—Kilimanjaro, with a permanent ice-cap, rising to 19,340 feet above sea-level, and the deep trough-like depression filled by the waters of Lake Tanganyika, the world's second deepest lake. Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to the great central plateau, which for the most part maintains an altitude of some 4,000 feet, is sharply defined along both its eastern and western margins by a series of steep-sided and deeply eroded escarpments, and falls sharply to the west to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika 2,534 feet; Nyasa 1,568 feet)* which lie in the trough of the great Rift Valley. Along both the eastern and western escarpment edges the plateau has been elevated to form long but relatively narrow belts of high country, rising in several places to over 7,000 feet. In the west this belt is cut by the valley of the Malagarasi River. This valley provides a drainage outlet to Lake Tanganyika from a large part of the central plateau, and thus extends the Congo-Atlantic drainage basin to within about 350 miles of the Indian Ocean. The escarpment to the east of Lake Nyasa is broken by the Ruhuhu River. The valley of the Ruhuhu is of importance as forming possibly the only practical alignment for a rail connexion between the coast and Lake Nyasa. Approximately half of the two great lakes, Victoria and Tanganyika, lie within the Territory's borders, and lakes Natron, Manyara, Eyasi (in the north) and Rukwa (in the south-west) account for most of the remainder of the 20,000 square miles of inland water.

Climate

Roughly, three climatic zones can be distinguished:

(i) The coast region and immediately adjoining hinterland—tropical, temperature seldom below 80° during October–May, when the two rainy seasons occur; between June and September it is much cooler; average temperature 76°; average rainfall 40 inches.

(ii) The central plateau, altitudes 2,000–4,000 feet—prevailing characteristics low humidity, rainfall 20–40 inches annually, mean temperature over 70° with great daily and seasonal variations, sometimes exceeding 30° daily; nights almost invariably cool.

(iii) The semi-temperate regions round the slopes of Kilimanjaro (19,340 feet) and Meru (14,979 feet) to the north of the Territory, the "Winter Highlands" further west, the Usambara and Pare Highlands in the north-east, the Fipa Plateau in the south-west, and the mountainous areas to the north and east of Lake Nyasa (5,000 to 10,000 feet); frosts at higher altitudes, nights cold.

Generally speaking, the rainfall is low for a tropical country. Except for the northern and middle sections of the coastal belt, where the advent of the rain is dependent on the south-east and the north-east monsoon currents, and the areas around Lake Victoria and the north of Lake Nyasa—where there are two distinct rainy seasons—the greater part of the Territory has generally a one-season rainfall, beginning in November or December and continuing more or less unbrokenly to the end of April or May.

*Lake Victoria is 3,717 feet above sea level.

History

The country now known as Tanganyika came under German influence largely through the initiative of Dr. Karl Peters. In 1884 he journeyed into the interior and concluded twelve treaties with chiefs whose chiefdoms were then declared to be German territory. In 1885 the land he had acquired was placed under the protection of the Imperial German Government. A ten-mile belt along the coast was regarded as belonging to Zanzibar, but in 1888 Germany acquired the right of collecting duties on the coast and in 1890 took over the coastal strip on payment of £200,000 to the Sultan of Zanzibar. For some time after their acquisition of the territory the Germans were engaged in quelling risings, and in 1905 there broke out a serious rebellion, known as the "maji-maji" rising, in the southern areas and extending from Lake Nyasa in the interior to Kilwa on the coast.

Soon after the outbreak of the 1914–18 war clashes took place between British and German forces on the northern frontier of the Territory, but the serious attempt to occupy the country did not begin until 1916. By the end of that year all the country north of the Central Railway was occupied by British or Belgian forces and a provisional Civil Administration was established for that area on the 1st January 1917. In November 1917 the German forces were driven across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese East Africa and the occupation of the whole of the Territory was then completed. By the Treaty of Peace with Germany, signed at Versailles in 1919, Germany renounced in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights over her overseas possessions, including her East African colony. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that His Britannic Majesty should exercise a mandate to administer this former German colony, except for the areas of Ruanda and Urundi, for which the mandate was given to the Belgian Government. In 1920 the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Territory was constituted. Since then the administration of the Territory has continued to be carried out under the terms of the mandate until the establishment of the Trusteeship System under the Charter of the United Nations.

Constitution

The Territory is administered by the Governor who is assisted by a Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, which is presided over by the Governor, consists of the Deputy Governor, two ex officio members (the Attorney-General and the Minister for Information Services) and ten members appointed by the Governor by Instrument. At present one of the appointed members (the Minister for Finance) is a nominated member of Legislative Council and the remaining nine members (namely the Chief Minister and the Ministers for Lands, Surveys and Water; Health and Labour; Home Affairs; Communications, Power and Works; Agriculture and Co-operative Development; Commerce and Industry; Education; and Local Government and Housing) are elected members of Legislative Council. The two ex officio members of the Council of Ministers are also ex officio members of Legislative Council.

The Tanganyika (Legislative Council) Orders in Council, 1926–60 and Royal Instructions, provide for a Legislative Council, presided over by a Speaker appointed by the Governor, consisting...
of not more than 83 members of whom 71 are elected members, two are ex officio members, and not more than ten are nominated members.

The Territory is divided into 50 constituencies of which 37 are represented by one elected member, five are represented by two elected members and eight are represented by three elected members. Eleven elected members are required to be Asians and ten are required to be Europeans.

Land Policy

Subject to the validity of any title to land or any interest therein lawfully acquired before the 26th January 1923, the whole of the lands of the Territory, whether occupied or unoccupied on that date, were declared to be public lands under the control of and subject to the disposition of the Governor, to be held and administered by him for the use and common benefit, direct or indirect, of the natives of the Territory. No title to the occupation and use of any such lands is valid without the consent of the Governor who, in the exercise of his powers, is obliged to have regard to native laws and customs. The only grants of freehold title which the Governor may make over public land are grants to give effect to a contract or undertaking by the former German Government, certain grants by way of exchange for freehold land acquired by the Governor, and grants to the Board of Trustees of the Tanganyika Higher Education Trust Fund. The Governor may, where it appears to him to be in the general interests of the Territory, make grants of Rights of Occupancy over public land to both native and non-native persons for terms not exceeding 99 years and subject to the payment of a suitable rental, revisable at intervals of not more than thirty-three years. Land lawfully used or occupied by a native or native community in accordance with native law and custom is deemed to be held on a Right of Occupancy.

Taxation

The tax system includes indirect taxation in the form of import, export and excise duties, stamp duties, and miscellaneous licence fees.

Particulars of direct taxation are set out below.

(a) Personal Tax is payable by all males over 18, irrespective of race: the rates are related to an individual's chargeable income. The minimum and maximum rates payable per annum are Shs. 12/- and Shs. 180/- respectively.

(b) Non-Native Education Tax is payable by every male non-native over 18 resident in the Territory, and assessed on Personal Tax payable.

(c) Municipal House Tax is levied on owners of houses in townships, not including native dwellings, at rates not exceeding 15% of the net annual value of the house. The tax is not leviable in those townships where local rates are in force.

(d) Income Tax—Resident individuals pay 2/- in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, 3/- in the £ on the next £400, 4/- in the £ on the next £400, 5/- in the £ on the next £400, 6/- in the £ on the next £400, 7/- in the £ on the next £500, 8/- in the £ on the next £500, 9/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 10/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 11/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 12/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 13/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 14/- in the £ on the next £1,000, and 15/- in the £ on every pound after £9,000.

Non-resident individuals pay at the rate of 2/- in the £ where the chargeable income does not exceed £800. Where it exceeds £800 the rates of tax as for residents apply. The chargeable income of individuals is calculated by deducting the total of personal allowances which can be claimed from the total income figure.

Limited Companies pay at the rate of Shs.5/50 in the £ on income as computed for Income Tax purposes.

* Contributions from Territorial to Development Funds are excluded from the former's expenditure and the latter's revenue.

† Since 1st July 1954 the financial year has run from the 1st July to the 30th June. An interim budget covered the first six months of 1954.

In 1959–60 the sum of over £10·25 million was received from Customs and Excise duties, nearly £6·75 million from licences and taxes, and over £4 million on Development Plan Account.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were over £4 million on Development Plan Account, over £2½ million Public Works, £3·4 million Education (including expenditure by non-native Education Authorities), over £1·75 million Medical Services, over £1·5 million Police, over £1 million Provincial Administration, over £1 million for Pensions and Gratuities, £657,000 for Defence, over £730,000 for Agriculture, over £490,000 for Veterinary and over £840,000 East Africa High Commission.

The Public Debt, funded and unfunded, at 30th June 1960 amounted to £21,606,232 (approximately £2 7s. 0d. per head of population) and comprised:

Currency

This is issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The British East Africa shilling is the standard coin. Subsidiary coins are of the following denominations: 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents and 50 cents. There are 100 cents to the shilling. Currency notes are issued in the following denominations: Sh. 5/-, Sh. 10/-, Sh. 20/-, Sh. 100/- and Sh. 1,000/-.

Development Plans

Since 1948 there has been a steady rate of development and it is anticipated that this development will continue at a rate of £4 million per annum of capital expenditure. The following figures are of interest in illustrating the development which has taken place in the past ten years:

| Year     | Amount (£) |
|----------|-----------|
| 1950     | 3,438,000 |
| 1951     | 3,830,000 |
| 1952     | 5,009,310 |
| 1953     | 3,699,000 |
| 1954 (First six months) | 1,600,785 |
| 1954/55  | 3,657,997 |
| 1955/56  | 4,283,672 |
| 1956/57  | 5,431,060 |
| 1957/58  | 5,597,890 |
| 1958/59  | 5,274,892 |
| 1959/60  | 4,024,306 |

These funds come from a variety of sources but the main items are Loan Funds, Colonial Development and Welfare grants and contributions from Tanganyika Revenue.

The revised Development Plan covering the period July 1957 to June 1961 envisaged expenditure of £26.9 million. Of this sum, 52% was for basic development—communications, public works and township services; 26% for the development of social services and urban housing; and 22% for the provision of increased agricultural productivity, rural water supplies, bush clearing and resettlement, forestry, veterinary and co-operative development training, research and extension work. The position is under review and account will be taken of the recommendations of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Survey Mission, which visited the territory in 1959, in drawing up a new development plan.

Other Development

The Tanganyika Wattle Company, whose wattle plantations extend to 33,000 acres, opened their extract factory early in 1959 and produced 6,000 tons of extract during the year. The Urema Wattle Scheme, which enables African growers to produce bark for the factory, continues to expand, but will not come into production until 1964.

The modified programme pursued by the Tanganyika Agricultural Corporation lays stress on such crops as soya beans, maize, simsim, and tobacco, in addition to groundnuts. Ranching is being undertaken at Kongwa and in an area near the Ruvu River some 50 miles west of Dar es Salaam.

Following on a preliminary reconnaissance by an F.A.O. expert in 1953, a survey of the Rufiji basin has been completed by the Tanganyika Agricultural Corporation, on behalf of the Tanganyika Government, assisted by a team of F.A.O. experts. The project was financed mainly from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The object of the survey is to lay down the main lines of the development of the basin and to ensure that such development as is immediately possible is in line with the overall scheme. The first major step in development has been the initiation in 1959 of a scheme for irrigated tenant farming which will eventually cover some 5,000 acres. During 1960, the headworks, main channel and some feeders were completed, and 200 acres brought into cultivation.

In 1960 a new scheme for continuing forestry development at an increased rate was approved, a grant of £518,000 being made available from Colonial Development and Welfare funds to finance the scheme for the four years 1960–61 to 1963–64. The grant is being used to pay for further timber stocktaking in the high forests and miombo woodlands; the planned tending and management of a further 12,000 acres of forest to obtain and foster young regrowth of valuable timber trees to replace the mature trees felled for timber; and the planting of 16,000 acres of new timber plantations of pine, cypress and teak at 18 forest stations.

Under the management of De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited, there has been a steady increase in output from the Mwadui Mine of Williamson Diamonds Limited, which is owned jointly by De Beers and the Tanganyika Government.

The Kiabakari Gold Mine of Tangold Mining Company Limited, in Musoma District came into initial production in February 1959 and has since maintained a steady output. The Kaborishoke Tin Mine of Kyerwa Syndicate in Karagwe District also came into initial production early in 1959.

Progress in the development of a satisfactory reduction process for the niobium bearing pyrochlore deposit at Panda Hill near Mbeya by the Mbeya Exploration Company Limited, has been slow and exploitation of the deposit has been delayed.

Substantial tonnages of phosphatic rock have been proved at Minjingu in Mbulu District by Goldfields of South Africa and investigations are in hand with a view to bringing the deposit into economic production for the local market.

The Directors of Uruwira Minerals Limited, announced during November that, consequent on the failure of prospecting operations, their Mpanda Mine would close down during 1960. This mine has for the past 16 years maintained a steady output of copper-lead concentrates which have contributed substantially to the territory's revenue.

Education

Facilities for higher education are provided by the University College of Makerere at Kampala, Uganda, and at the Royal Technical College of East Africa, Nairobi. There are 196 students from Tanganyika at Makerere and 26 at the Royal Technical College.

There are about 500 students from Tanganyika known to be receiving post-secondary education in the United Kingdom at the present time, and about 200 in other countries.

The system of African education provides for three stages up to secondary level; the Primary School Standards I–IV, the Middle School V–VIII and the Secondary School IX–XIII inclusive. In addition, Higher School Certificate classes were opened in January 1959 at three boys secondary schools and at one girls secondary school. In 1959 the number of pupils attending schools was
as follows: Primary pupils 375,008; Middle school pupils 39,871; Secondary pupils 4,132; Teacher Training Centres 1,467; Technical and vocational training 1,836.

In 1959, nine Government Primary Schools, 12 assisted schools, nine unaided schools, together with a Government Correspondence Course, gave primary education to 2,092 European children and 766 received secondary education at one assisted secondary school and in secondary classes attached to 12 primary schools, while about 750 received grants towards the cost of secondary education outside the territory.

Indian pupils numbering 15,872 attended four Government, 111 assisted and two unassisted primary schools; and 7,816 Indians received secondary education at six Government and 25 assisted schools. Another 1,049 non-Africans received primary education, and 391 secondary education, at assisted schools for other non-Africans including Goans.

Expenditure on educational services during 1959-60 (excluding £489,072 spent on capital works) amounted to £3,416,414. This total includes contributions amounting to £295,181 from Local Authorities and expenditure met from Non-Native Education Authority funds amounting to £882,283. In 1935 the total expenditure was £81,100.

Libraries

In Dar es Salaam there are the King George V Museum Library, the Arnautoglu Library which caters for all races and contains books in English, Swahili and Arabic, The British Council Library, and the High Court Library, which is open to all members of the Legal Department, to other serving officers of the Colonial Legal Service and to Advocates who have been admitted to practice in Her Majesty’s High Court of Tanganyika and courts subordinate thereto.

The East African Literature Bureau runs postal and Book Box Services throughout the territory for African readers and the Social Development Department of the Tanganyika Government runs a combined book and cinema van and libraries at various community centres to serve Africans outside Dar es Salaam. In addition various schools, clubs and other institutions have libraries in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere.

Health

There are 663 out-patient dispensaries maintained by Native Authorities, six by Government, 130 by grant-earning missions and 260 by private bodies and industry. The Native Authorities maintain 275 maternity and child health clinics, Government 127 and missions 220. There are 19 major leprosaria of which some are maintained by Government and some by grant-aided missions. Government, missions and industrial concerns maintain a total of 237 hospitals and bedded dispensaries with 14,556 beds. During 1959, 287,953 in-patients and 17,720,183 out-patients were treated at Government and mission hospitals and dispensaries, and at Native Authority dispensaries.

Total estimated expenditure on medical and allied services in 1959-60 was £1,943,632. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £193,390. These figures exclude such items as medical building works provided for in the Public Works estimates and public health measures undertaken by the various township authorities or the expenditure on medical services by industry and voluntary agencies.

Communications

Air—The main airport is Dar es Salaam which has full customs and other facilities, and is designed to take aircraft up to Britannia class. Customs facilities are available on a request basis at Kigoma, Tabora, Mtwara, Mbeya and Tanga.

East African Airways Corporation operate scheduled services into Arusha, Iringa, Kilwa, Lindi, Mafia, Mombo, Mpanda, Mwanza, Nachingwea, Njombe, Songea and Sao Hill. In addition Dominie aircraft of Caspair Air Service operate scheduled services into Bukoba, Geita and Musoma.

Kigoma, Kongwa, Mwadui, Seronera, Dodoma, and Urambo are capable of taking Dakota aircraft, but are not at present served by scheduled services.

There are, in addition, 31 minor aerodromes or landing grounds. Three are privately owned, and three are maintained for the International Red Locust Control Service.

East African Airways Corporation provide services connecting Tanganyika with the main centres of Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar and Regional Services to the Central African Territories, India, Pakistan, Portuguese East Africa and South Africa using Dakota and Canadair Aircraft.

The Central African Airways Corporation operate a Beaver Service between Nyasaland and Mbeya.

East African Airways Corporation operate a fortnightly Britannia service connecting Dar es Salaam to London.

A number of small charter aircraft are based at Dar es Salaam and at Mwanza on Lake Victoria.

Air Navigational Services controlled by the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation, with a Regional Office in Dar es Salaam, are available at eleven aerodromes.

Meteorological Services are supplied by the East African Meteorological Department, with a Regional Office in Dar es Salaam.

Rail—The railways of the Territory are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under “East Africa High Commission”).

Road—There are 490 miles of roads in townships, 135 in other settlements, 3,588 miles of trunk roads, 4,781 miles of local main roads, 11,033 miles of district roads and approximately 8,500 miles of village roads.

Water.—Tanganyika has four ports on the Indian Ocean: Tanga in the north, Dar es Salaam in the centre, Lindi and Mtwara in the south. Deep water berths are available at all ports, alongside wharves at Dar es Salaam and Mtwara and at buoys or anchorages in all four ports. Transit and storage sheds, stocking ground areas, cranes and other handling appliances, lighters and port craft, lights and navigational aids are modern and available at all ports.

The ports are well served by some 23 world shipping lines, the flow of imports and exports being regular and at reasonable charge. Coastwise shipping is operated by the regular lines, international as well as local, all subject to international rules and regulations, and by
small local craft, subject only to the territorial government's "Regulation Governing Native Craft".

Passenger and freight services are operated on Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Administration and on Lake Nyasa by Nyasaland Railways Limited. These steamer services connect the railways of Tanganyika with those of Kenya and Uganda and the transport systems of the Congo Republic, Ruanda Urundi and Northern Rhodesia.

Broadcasting

The Tanganyika Broadcasting Corporation is an independent statutory corporation which took over from Government in July 1956 the operation and development of a broadcasting service. Its policy is directed by a Board whose members are nominated by Government. The Board's executive officer is Director of Broadcasting. The Tanganyika Broadcasting Corporation derives its revenue from (1) Government subvention; (2) wireless licences; (3) commercial advertising, including sponsored programmes. There are two separate programmes, both originating in Dar es Salaam, one in Swahili (National Programme), the other in English and Asian languages (Second Programme). Three shortwave transmitters are used (20 kW., 10 kW. and 5 kW.), working in the tropical wavebands, giving normal coverage, and two medium wave transmitters of 1½ kW. each for the Dar es Salaam area only.

Principal Occupations

Most of the self-employed indigenous inhabitants are engaged in agriculture. The numbers of African adult males employed (at a census held during the third quarter of 1959) are classified in the following major industrial groups:

In 1959 there were 35 registered trade unions with a total membership of about 80,000, one staff association of Government servants and one of High Commission servants. In addition there were 49 joint committees in Government service, four in the East Africa High Commission and 189 in private industry.

Main Crops and Products

Agriculture is the most important industry, the main crops being sisal, coffee, cotton, cashew nuts, maize, millet, sorghums, beans and pulses, paddy, cassava, sweet potatoes, bananas, groundnuts, pyrethrum, tobacco, copra, sugar, wheat, tea and oilseeds.

A number of new schemes financed in part by Colonial Development and Welfare funds were initiated in 1960. They were largely designed to bring about increased productivity in respect of cocoa, tea, turkish tobacco and hibiscus fibre. Earlier schemes initiated in 1957 have resulted in increased acreages of coffee and pyrethrum. Although the volume of agricultural exports again increased in 1959 the gross export value remained at the 1958 level of £33,000,000.

Livestock at a 1958 census numbered: cattle 7,414,755, sheep 2,805,202, goats 4,124,056, pigs 17,438, donkeys 125,068, horses 242.

Timber exports (gross) in 1959 totalled 773,214 cubic feet valued at £575,901. Minor forest products exported were valued at a further £806,000 (including beeswax valued at £170,288).

There is extensive fishing in inland and coastal waters and fish-farming is being actively encouraged.

The principal mineral exports in 1959 comprised diamonds, gold bullion, lead concentrates containing valuable amounts of copper and precious metals, salt, mica and tin concentrates. Other minerals exported included garnet, gypsum, magnesite, meerschaum and vermiculite.

There were in 1959 4,149 premises registered as factories under the Factories Ordinance, employing 76,914 persons, 71,914 of whom were Africans. The industries employing most labour were sisal and sansevieria processing (230 premises), sawmilling (100), woodworking—including carpentry, joinery and cabinet making (379), tailoring and dressmaking (848) and motor vehicle repairs (253). Among the industries are 54 manufacturing soap, 6 sugar, 51 curing tobacco, 134 pulping and 11 curing coffee, 39 cotton-ginning, 35 generating electricity, and 1,108 milling flour and rice.
