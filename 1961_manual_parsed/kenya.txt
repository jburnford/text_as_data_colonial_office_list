KENYA

Area

The Colony and Protectorate of Kenya is bisected by the equator and extends approximately from latitude 4° N. to latitude 4° S. and from longitude 34° E. to 41° E.

The total area is 224,960 square miles (including 5,171 square miles of water).
Population

At 1st July 1960 the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at some 6.55 million persons, of whom 6.3 million were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe     | Per cent. |
|-----------|-----------|
| Kikuyu    | 19.5      |
| Luo       | 14.4      |

| Kamba     | 11.7      |
| Meru      | 6.2       |
| Nyika     | 5.6       |

The total non-African population in mid-1960 has been estimated at 286,700:

- Europeans: 67,700
- Indians, Pakistanis and Goans: 174,300
- Arabs: 38,600
- Other non-natives: 6,100

Geographical Features

Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Taita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Nyiru, 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,058 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,104). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30–40 miles wide and 2,000–3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

History

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Ethiopia in 1947 which will supersede the original agreement of 1907, when the demarcated frontier is ratified.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten sea miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which an annuity of £16,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made in 1887 to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution

Under the Kenya (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, which came into operation on 5th April 1958 as amended by the Kenya (Constitution) (Amendment) Order in Council, 1960 which came into operation on 15th April 1960 and Royal Instructions of 3rd April 1958, the Colony and Protectorate is administered by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, who is advised by a Council of Ministers. There is provision for not more than 15 Ministers, of whom not less than four shall be public officers. In the present Council of Ministers there are ten unofficial Ministers, four of these are Africans, four Europeans and two Asians. There is also provision for not more than six Assistant Ministers who may be appointed by the Governor to assist the Ministers. The Governor's Personal Adviser on Arab Affairs has the right to attend and participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers.

The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker, appointed by the Governor; "Ex Officio Members", who are for the time being Ministers or Temporary Ministers, but not otherwise members of the Legislative Council; 36 Constituency Elected Members, of whom 14 are European, 14 African, 6 Asian (of whom 2 are Muslim) and 2 Arab; Speciality Elected Members, at present 12, elected by Legislative Council members sitting as an electoral college, of whom 4 are European, 4 African, 2 non-Muslim Asian, 1 a Muslim Asian and 1 an Arab; and a varying number of Nominated Members, at present 38, nominated by the Governor.
A Council of State, designed to protect any community against harmful discriminatory legislation, has also been established under the Order and may consist of a chairman and not more than 16 and not less than 10 members.

In the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly Kenya is represented by two Nominated and six Unofficial Members, two of the latter being European, two Asian, and two African.

At a Conference in London in January/February 1960 the majority of the Kenya delegates accepted proposals to reform the executive and legislature as the next stage in Kenya's advance. The Council of Ministers will then contain 4 officials, 4 Africans, 3 Europeans and 1 Asian; and the Legislative Council will include 53 constituency members elected on a common roll (of whom 10 will be Europeans, 8 Asians and 2 Arabs) and 12 national members to succeed the Specially Elected Members, in the same racial proportions but chosen by only the elected members. There will also be judicial safeguards to protect the rights of the individual. The Kenya (Constitution) (Amendment No. 2) Order in Council, 1960 designed to bring into effect these changes was made on 30th November 1960 and will come into effect at a time to be appointed by the Governor. Elections to the new Legislative Council take place in February 1961.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by other local authorities. There are now 26 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local by-laws regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. Seven County Councils have been established under the Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, for the Nairobi, Nakuru, Naivasha, Aberdare, Nyanza, Kitale and Usin Gishu Districts.

There are six municipal authorities established under the Municipalities Ordinance: the City of Nairobi, the Municipal Councils of Eldoret, Mombasa and Nakuru, and the Municipal Boards of Kitale and Kisumu. Kisumu became a municipal council in 1960, and all the municipal authorities now have elected as well as nominated members.

**Land Policy**

All land in Kenya, apart from a few freeholds mainly around Nairobi and in the Protectorate, falls into one of two categories: (a) Crown lands, (b) Native lands. "Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

The "native lands" were created by the Kenya (Native Areas) Order in Council 1939 which preserved for the Africans living in such areas all rights and interests enjoyed under native customary law. By the Order in Council, the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of land is governed by customary law except in so far as specific provision is contained in the Native Lands Trust Ordinance (Cap. 100 Revised Laws of Kenya). This is still the case in the greater part of the Native Lands today, but the Native Lands Registration Ordinance, enacted in 1959, makes provision for the recognition, by registration, of rights of ownership under customary law as freehold and of lesser rights not amounting to freehold. Individual title has already been registered over large areas of the Kikuyu Districts and parts of the Nandi and Elgeyo-Marakwet Districts. In registered areas, except as regards inheritance and succession, native law and custom and the Native Lands Trust Ordinance, are superseded by the provisions of the Native Lands Registration Ordinance and the ordinary land laws of the Colony. A second Ordinance, enacted simultaneously, provides for control over land transactions to be exercised by Provincial and Divisional Boards, of which the composition is predominantly African. It is the intention gradually to extend this system of registration and control to other areas of the native lands where the concept of individual ownership has emerged.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township, or native reserve, is alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

Proposals to place the management and tenure of all land on the same non-racial basis have been published in Kenya Government Sessional Papers No. 10 of 1958-59 and No. 6 of 1959-60 and will be brought into effect by the Kenya (Land) Order in Council, 1960 which was made on the 30 November 1960 and by consequential local legislation. The Order replaces the Kenya (Native Areas) Orders in Council, 1939 and 1958 and the Kenya (Highlands) Order in Council, 1939 and divides all land in Kenya into private, Crown or trust land. It replaces the Highlands Board by a multi-racial Central Land Advisory Board to advise the Governor on land matters, prohibits the creation of racial restrictions on the ownership or occupation of land and empowers the Governor to make regulations governing generally the development, control and use of all land and for enabling certain Crown lessees to convert their tenure to freehold.

**Taxation**

The forms of direct taxation which apply to all communities are income tax and personal tax. The maximum rate of personal tax in 1959 was Shs. 150/- Under the Income Tax Acts generous personal allowances are given. The rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 2/- in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases gradually to a maximum rate of Shs. 15/- in the £ where the chargeable income exceeds £9,000. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/50 in the £. A graduated hospital tax calculated on total income is also payable by all Europeans and Asians.

Currency

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board whose headquarters are in Kenya, on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-), and Shs. 1/- (notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

Under the ten-year Development Programme, 1946-55, £38·8 million was allocated, of which £27·4 million was spent over the eight years 1946-53. Of this expenditure 45% was financed from loans, 24% from Colony revenue and 18% from various appropriated funds.

A new Development Programme covered the three and a half years, 1954-57, during which £21·7 million was spent, mainly from loan moneys. Other development expenditure outside the three-and-a-half-year programme amounted to £13·8 million during the same planning period, making a total of £35·5 million in all.

A further Development Programme was in force for the three years 1957-60, embracing all important development projects.

Education (1959)

European. 45 primary schools (19 government, 14 aided, 12 unaided) with altogether 9,265 pupils; 15 secondary schools (6 government, 1 aided, 8 unaided) with altogether 3,189 pupils.

Asian. 119 primary schools (27 government, 86 aided, 6 unaided) with altogether 40,521 pupils; 38 secondary schools (17 government, 10 aided, 11 unaided) with altogether 9,568 pupils; 3 government teacher-training centres with altogether 346 students. The 17 government and 11 unaided secondary schools include primary schools with secondary modern courses.

African. 4,703 primary and intermediate schools (17 government, 4,163 aided, 523 unaided) with altogether 667,105 pupils, 39 secondary schools (1 government, 27 aided, 11 unaided) with altogether 4,894 pupils, 43 teacher-training colleges (40 aided, 3 unaided) with altogether 3,867 students.

Arab and Others. 9 primary schools (8 government, 1 aided) with altogether 2,619 pupils, 2 government secondary schools with 299 pupils.

Higher Education

During the year 1959-60, there were 354 students from Kenya (including 30 Asians, 2 Arabs, and 1 European) studying at Makerere College in Uganda.

The Royal Technical College of East Africa was opened in Nairobi in April, 1956. There are Faculties of Architecture, Arts, Science, Engineering and Commerce and a Department of Domestic Science. In 1959-60 there were 175 Kenya students studying at the College consisting of 11 Europeans, 92 Asians and 72 Africans.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education in institutions overseas as well as in Makerere College and the Royal Technical College, Nairobi. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds allocated under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also a few scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly for local...
education, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for teachers to enable them to take degree and other courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts. Among other sources of funds to assist students going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Governments of India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Ghana respectively, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards made on the recommendation of a Committee for Study and Training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

In addition to these awards a new scheme has been started to assist in the higher education of Government servants which provides "Kenya Development Scholarships", open to Kenya Government servants of all races recommended by the Heads of their Departments, to pursue courses which will either improve their capacity as Government servants or fit them for promotion.

An Educational Trust has been formed by a private donor called the Maniben and Mohamedali Rattansi Educational Trust. In the terms of the Trust the income is divided into five equal parts for awards annually to Europeans, Africans, Muslims, non-Muslims and Ismailis. Awards are made from this Trust to students of all races for studies in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere.

The total number of Kenya students taking courses of higher education in the United Kingdom during 1959 was 1,018. This number included 94 Africans (45 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 668 Asians and Goans (117 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 18 Arabs (14 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), and 238 Europeans (72 with bursaries, scholarships or loans). There were 70 Africans in India and Pakistan during this period, 171 in the U.S.A. and Canada and 11 in various other countries.

Trade and Technical Education

There were, in 1959, five Government Technical and Trade Schools for African boys, admitting students who had completed eight years of schooling, for a three or four-year course of training; in 1959, 1,228 indentured apprentices were receiving instruction in building, engineering, tailoring and leather-work trades. Each year 40 boys are selected by competitive examination for admission to Secondary Technical courses leading to the General Certificate of Education of the Associated Examining Board at Ordinary level. Twenty-five pupils were admitted for a clerical course.

Vocational training was also given in one aided school and at a number of unaided rural training centres. A number of Government Departments and the East African Railways and Harbours and the Posts and Telecommunications Administrations, conducted training courses for students from the intermediate and secondary schools entering their service.

The Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education, which ranks as a Technical Institute, had 249 students enrolled in 1959.

There were two Asian Technical High Schools providing courses in technical and commercial subjects to School Certificate level. Technical Institute classes in Nairobi were organized in temporary accommodation during 1959; 94 students attended day-release classes in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering subjects and 166 students attended part-time evening classes in Technical Commercial subjects.

Government expenditure on education in 1959-60 was:

| Gross expenditure | £6,226,534 |
|------------------|------------|
| Net expenditure  | £5,364,685 |
| Appropriations-in-aid | £861,849 |

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library, which caters for all races, in addition to the Desai Memorial Library, also in Nairobi, and the Seif bin Salim Public Library in Mombasa. In Nairobi the British Council and the United States Information Service maintain lending libraries and reading rooms open to the public. There is a large collection of reference books on natural sciences in the Coryndon Memorial Museum in Nairobi.

The East African Literature Bureau runs book box services for African readers throughout the Colony where bookshops are unknown.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Curator, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, is assisted by a staff of seven Europeans and eighteen Africans, with part-time assistance from two other Europeans.

Fort Jesus, Mombasa's three centuries old Portuguese monument, was opened to the public as a museum in 1960. It contains archaeological and historical specimens from the former fortress and from other parts of the African Coast.

Health

The principal causes of mortality are general infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory diseases, alimentary, allergic, metabolic and blood diseases in that order. Towards the end of 1959 a poliomyelitis epidemic started in Central Province and spread throughout Kenya: those affected were mostly African children under the age of two years. As a control measure Sabin-type vaccine was administered to over 1½ million of the population.

In 1959 beds in hospitals (including mission and non-Government hospitals) totalled 9,717. In-patients in Government Hospitals totalled 155,195, and out-patients 1,030,319. The development of Health Centres continues and at the end of 1959 80 were in operation.

Total expenditure of the Medical Department in 1959 was £2,108,149 together with Development expenditure of £136,523.

Communications

East African Airways Corporation operates in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of charter aircraft-operating companies are based at Wilson Airport (formerly called Nairobi West).

All scheduled international and internal services are operated from the new Nairobi airport at Embakasi whilst Wilson Airport (formerly Nairobi West) is retained for smaller charter operations and club flying. Eastleigh Airport is now used by the Royal Air Force mainly as a maintenance base and both their transit and locally based aircraft normally operate from Embakasi.

Air Traffic Control and Telecommunications Services are provided by the Directorate of Civil
Aviation, East Africa, and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. Air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the East Africa High Commission.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Congo, Aden and Madagascar.

There are approximately 25,000 miles of roads; only about 634 are bitumen surfaced. The main roads (3,755 miles, excluding Northern Frontier Province), where not bituminized, are gravel-surfaced and, for the most part, all-weather except during excessive rains. Secondary roads (6,200 miles) are mostly gravel-surfaced, but are more subject to closure to heavy traffic in wet weather. Considerable improvements in alignment and formation have been effected on the main roads, and many secondary roads, during recent years. The Government have recently embarked on a contractor finance scheme of £4 million to extend the mileage of bitumen on the more important trunk roads in the Colony. The completion of this programme, expected in mid-1963, will add about another 230 miles of bitumen.

Broadcasting

Kenya was the first British Colonial Territory to have a regular public wireless broadcasting service. Until 1st October 1959 there were three broadcasting organizations in Nairobi:

(i) Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited provided services in the English and Asian languages under a Charter granted to them in 1931. This Charter expired in September 1956 but by an agreement between the Company and the Government Cable and Wireless continued to provide these services.

(ii) The Kenya Government through its Department of Information operated a service for African listeners in Swahili and many vernacular languages. It was known as the African Broadcasting Service and broadcasts from four stations at Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nyeri.

(iii) The Forces Broadcasting Station has been operating since 1944 a service for British troops stationed within the Colony.

In 1954 the Kenya Government appointed a Commission, three of whose four members were B.B.C. officials, to make recommendations on the development of broadcasting in Kenya. The Government has drawn up its plans for the future of broadcasting in Kenya on the basis of the Commission’s Report and these plans have now been largely implemented with the establishment in 1958 of a Department of Broadcasting, known as the Kenya Broadcasting Service, which took over all the African Services from 1st July 1959 and the English and Asian Services from Cable and Wireless, Ltd., from 1st October 1959.

The new Kenya Broadcasting Service provides the following separate services:

(i) English National Service, broadcasting in English from Nairobi for 90 hours per week, on both short and medium wave;

(ii) Asian National Service, broadcasting in four Asian languages from Nairobi for 67½ hours per week, on short and medium wave;

(iii) African National Service, broadcasting in Swahili and English, from Nairobi for 52½ hours per week, on short and medium wave;

(iv) Nairobi Regional Service broadcasting in Somali, Kikamba and Kikuyu, from Nairobi, for 12 hours per week, on short and medium wave;

(v) Mount Kenya Station, broadcasting in Kikuyu from Nyeri, for 37 hours a week, on short wave only;

(vi) West Regional Station, broadcasting in Luo, Kisii, Kalenjin, Luhya, Swahili and English, from Kisumu, for 60 hours per week on short and medium wave;

(vii) Coast Regional Station, in Swahili, Arabic and Ki-Mvita, broadcasting from Mombasa, for 57½ hours per week, on medium wave only.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. The numbers reported in employment in other occupations in 1959 are shown in the following table:

| Industry                                      | Africans | Asians | Europeans |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing             | 249,400  | 563    | 1,749     |
| Mining and Quarrying                          | 5,187    | 182    | 57        |
| Manufacturing and Repairs                     | 44,206   | 6,811  | 2,700     |
| Building and Construction                     | 16,059   | 2,385  | 453       |
| Electric Light, Power and Water Supply        | 1,901    | 328    | 257       |

| Transport and Communications                  | 11,173   | 2,032  | 1,028     |
| Domestic Service                              | 24,288   | 116    | 50        |
| Public Services (including Railways)          | 139,976  | 11,128 | 8,975     |
| Other Services                                | 22,181   | 2,752  | 3,468     |
| All Industries and Services                   | 537,399  | 36,741 | 22,757    |

In December 1959, 42 employees’ and 10 employers’ unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total paid-up membership of employees’ unions, as shown on the 1959 returns, is 46,000. The membership claimed is considerably higher than that figure.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum, wattle bark and extract, sodium carbonate, meat, butter, ghee and cheese, hides and skins, maize, wheat and cotton.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony’s timber supplies—softwoods such as Podocarpus and East African pencil cedar and various hardwoods, of which East African olive and East African camphor are those in greatest demand. Forest produce from the established plantations is becoming available in increasing quantities and supplied 23% of the total sales of logs from the Forest Estate during 1959. The trade in mangrove poles from the coastal areas is still a substantial one, but there are signs that it is likely to decline. Attention is being directed towards the building up of an export trade in charcoal to counteract the loss in the demand for poles.
The fisheries in Lake Victoria produce some 25,000 tons of fish annually, worth over £1,000,000 to the fishermen. The Coast Fisheries produce some 4,000 tons annually worth £180,000 to the fishermen. As the result of research and technological experiments conducted in recent years, the marine production can be expected to increase in future.

In 1959 the chief minerals in order of value were cement, soda ash, copper, salt, refined gold, limestone (other than for cement), diatomite, carbon dioxide (natural), mullite and graphite. The total value of minerals won during 1959 was £5,319,355.

There are in operation in the Colony over 130 main types of manufacturing and industrial concerns which produce goods both for internal consumption and export. There is a steady overall increase in the export of Kenya's products. Exports of Pyrethrum Extract have more than doubled during the past four years. More than 27 countries are now purchasing this commodity from Kenya.

An ever-increasing export trade is enjoyed by African curios and carvings which command a ready market in the United Kingdom, United States, Mexico, Canada, and Australia.

| 1959  | 61,508      | 5,079      | 33,306            |

(Including bullion and specie, excluding all interterritorial transfers of domestic produce to Uganda and Tanganyika.)

In 1959, 37·5% of total direct imports came from the United Kingdom, 18·8% from other Commonwealth countries, and 38·9% from foreign countries; postal packages and special transactions accounted for 4·7%.

In 1959, 24·3% of domestic exports went to the United Kingdom, 19·0% to other Commonwealth countries, and 56·1% to foreign countries; 0·5% exported as ships' and aircraft stores.

The chief imports are: machinery and transport equipment; fuel and lubricants; food; miscellaneous manufactured articles, and chemicals.

Tourist Trade

Kenya's share of the East African income from tourism in 1959 is estimated at approximately £5,500,000 and so it ranks as the country's second largest "export". Visitors arriving in Kenya during 1959 totalled 44,929 and stayed an average of nearly 21 days.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

On 31st December 1959 there were 576 registered co-operative societies, with a total membership of 152,660. Of these, 527 were marketing societies, which include African, Asian, European and non-racial societies, and the value of the produce handled by them during the year was £19,500,000. This figure was less than the previous year due to falling market prices.
