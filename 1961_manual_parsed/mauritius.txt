MAURITIUS

Area

The area of Mauritius is approximately 720 square miles, that of Rodrigues 40 square miles and the area of the Lesser Dependencies, viz., the Chagos Archipelago (the largest islet is Diego Garcia), Agalega and the Cargados Carajos or St. Brandon Isles, approximately 47½ square miles.

Population

The estimated population at 31st December 1959 was: Mauritius 631,151, Rodrigues 17,443, Lesser Dependencies 1,678; divided approximately into: (1) general population, comprising Europeans and descendants of Europeans and people of African and mixed origin, 29%; (2) Indo-Mauritians, made up of immigrants from the
Indian subcontinent and their descendants, 67%; and Chinese, consisting of immigrants from China and their descendants, 4%.

**Principal Towns**

At the 31st December 1959 the estimated population of the principal towns was:

- Port Louis (capital) .. 87,550
- Curepipe .. 27,900
- Beau Bassin-Rose Hill .. 35,550
- Quatre Bornes .. 22,000

**Geographical Features**

The island lies in the Indian Ocean, 550 miles east of Madagascar. It is chiefly of volcanic formation but almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains, the principal peaks reaching about 2,700 feet. There are numerous rivers and streams; none of them are navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. Some of the larger waterfalls have been harnessed to supply hydro-electric power. The land rises gradually from the coasts, and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet. Remnants of the native forests of the island cover some 15,000 acres.

**Climate**

The south-east trade winds blow during most of the year and the climate is generally humid. The mean temperature varies from 74°F at sea level to 67°F at 2,000 feet. The highest and lowest values recorded at the Observatory, Pamplemousses, at an altitude of 180 feet, are 94·8°F and 49·9°F respectively.

Rainfall differs considerably according to the height above sea level. On the highest part of the central plateau an average of 200 inches falls each year but amounts decrease rapidly to 70 and 35 inches on the windward and leeward coasts. There is no marked dry season but in the three months from September to November rainfall is about one quarter of the fall in the three wettest months, January to March.

Tropical cyclones may occur between September and May but by far the greatest frequency and intensity is in January and February; March and April also being important months owing to the greater susceptibility to damage of the grown sugar cane. In about 10% of all years, mean wind speed over an hour reaches 50 m.p.h. and gusts 100 m.p.h.; gusts of 80 m.p.h. may be expected about 25 times every century.

**History**

Mauritius was probably first visited by Arab sailors and by Malays during the Middle Ages. During the early sixteenth century Portuguese sailors visited the island several times and the first European to discover it is believed to have been Domingos Fernandez. The Portuguese used it merely as a port of call without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch who landed in 1598 and gave the island the name of Mauritius in honour of their ruler, Prince Maurice of Nassau. Settlements were established from 1638 onwards but did not prosper, and the island was abandoned in 1710. In 1715 the island was formally taken possession of by the French. A small first contingent of colonists was sent in 1721 from the neighbouring island of Réunion (then called Bourbon), but it was not actually occupied until 1722 when a small party of colonists was sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The Island was then named Isle de France. From 1722 till about 1767 it was governed by that Company. From 1767 to 1810, apart from the brief period of independence under the Colonial Assembly during the French Revolution, it was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government.

During the long war between England and France, French men-of-war and privateers based on the Isle de France were a source of great mischief to the English merchant vessels. The British Government decided to capture the island and in 1810 a strong British expedition was eventually successful. The former name of Mauritius was then restored to it, and, with its dependencies, including Rodrigues, it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

**Constitution**

The Government is vested in a Governor with an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Mauritius (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, provides for a Legislative Council consisting of the Speaker (appointed by the Governor from outside the Council) three *ex officio* members (the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), 40 elected members and such nominated members not exceeding 12 in number as the Governor may appoint.

The Colony is divided into 40 single-member constituencies and every person (male or female) has the right to vote who:

(a) is a British subject of the age of 21 years or upwards; and

(b) has resided in the Colony for a period of at least six months immediately before the date of registration or is domiciled in the Colony and is residing therein at that date; and

(c) has resided in the constituency in which he claims to be registered as a voter for a period of at least six months immediately before the date of registration.

The Executive Council consists of the three *ex officio* members above mentioned and nine appointed members. The appointed members are persons who are elected or nominated members of the Legislative Council and are appointed by the Governor acting in his discretion. The *ex officio* members and the appointed members are all styled Ministers. Ministers are responsible to the Governor in Executive Council, and to the Legislative Council, for all matters affecting the departments with which they are associated.

The Ministerial system was established in July 1957, in anticipation of the new constitution provided by the Mauritius (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958.

**Land Policy**

Roughly one-sixth of the area of the island is owned by the Crown and consists of (a) Crown lands proper made up of unceded lands and lands re-acquired by the Crown, and (b) "Pas Geometriques," being reserved land lying on the
sea coast between the high water mark in spring tides and a line drawn parallel to the general contour of the coast at a distance of 81·21 metres. Alienable Crown lands may be sold only by public auction, except in the case of lands required for religious, charitable or educational purposes, or for public utility, when a nominal price is charged. The deeds of sale do not alienate the right of the Crown in respect of any mines of precious stones or metals or any layer of mineral oil or the right of the Crown of entering the property for the purpose of mining or of boring and collecting mineral oil, but no other restrictive clause is inserted in the deed of conveyance. Crown lands ("Pas Geometriques" excluded) may be leased by private contract or public auction. Portions of "Pas Geometriques" not exceeding two hectares may be leased by private contract after publication of notice. In the case of portions exceeding two hectares, the lease must be by public auction.

The remaining five-sixths of the area of the island are privately owned lands of which the holders are free to dispose as they think fit.

Taxation

Income tax rates for individuals are:

| Chargeable Income | Rate of tax cents |
|-------------------|------------------|
| For every rupee of the first Rs. 5,000 | 10 |

In ascertaining the chargeable income a number of deductions are allowed.

Company tax is at the rate of 40%.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariff and excise duties.

Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes bearing the effigy of H.M. Queen Elizabeth II of Rs.1,000 (legal tender between banks and Government only), Rs.25, Rs.10 and Rs.5; cupro-nickel coins of R.1, 50 cents, 25 cents and 10 cents and bronze coins of 5 cents, 2 cents, and 1 cent. The fixed rate of exchange is 1s. 6d. to the rupee. All currency notes prior to the 1954 issue have been demonetized as from 1st August 1955 by virtue of Proclamation No. 11 of 1955.

Development Plans

The Mauritius allocations under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts of 1950, 1955 and 1959 are £1,820,000 (Rs.24,260,000), £700,000 (Rs.9,333,333) and £750,000 (Rs.10,000,000) respectively. The balance from the first two allocations at the 1st July 1957 was £685,200 (Rs.9,136,000).

The Colony's Five-Year Development Programme for the period 1957–62 was estimated to cost some Rs.224 million. In view of the two cyclones which ravaged the island in early 1960, this programme has now had to be wound up and a new one for the five-year period 1960–65 is being formulated: to a large extent this will have to be concentrated upon cyclone repair and reconstruction and upon the construction of cyclone-proof houses.

Education

On 31st October 1959 there were 633 educational establishments in Mauritius. Of this total, 559 were primary schools, 69 secondary, two post-secondary and two Central Schools, one Technical Institute and Trade centre, with a total of 145,247 pupils. The Government institutions comprised 113 primary schools, two central schools, three secondary schools, one training college for teachers, one post-secondary College of Agriculture and one Technical Institute. Eight secondary and 76 primary schools within the total given above were State-aided. There were also a number of private day and evening schools teaching such subjects as the Koran, Urdu and Hindi. The Government awarded six scholarships in 1959 for higher education overseas. Mauritian students overseas, mainly in United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Universities, numbered 639.

Adult education courses provide for post-primary and post-secondary education with extension classes in Science, Handwork, Art, Typewriting, Shorthand, Book-keeping, and Electrical Engineering courses for apprentices.

In the financial year 1959–60, expenditure on education was Rs.19,185,747 (excluding capital expenditure on new buildings and other development works which cost Rs.2,944,298). In 1935 expenditure was Rs.1,347,201.
Libraries and Museums

There are seven Libraries:—(i) Police Library, Port Louis, (ii) Municipality of Port Louis Library, (iii) Town Council of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill Library, (iv) Carnegie Library, Curepipe, (v) Mauritius Institute Library, Port Louis, (vi) British Council Library, Rose Hill, (vii) Urban Council of Quatre Bornes Library.

The Natural History Museum, Port Louis, and the Historical Museum, Mahebourg, are both run by the Mauritius Institute. A small art gallery is also annexed to the Port Louis Museum.

Health

An outbreak of poliomyelitis started in June 1959 lasted 14 weeks and left in its wake 99 paralysed victims. No deaths were attributed to the disease. Sabin vaccination was given to about 200,000 people and this might have contributed to the abrupt end of the epidemic. There was also a mild outbreak of malaria which lasted throughout the year under review, during which eight cases of the disease were admitted to public hospitals. The main causes of morbidity were influenza and other diseases of the respiratory system, anaemias, diseases of the digestive system, and injuries.

The health inspectorate works from health offices of which there are 14 throughout the island. The total number of beds available in 1959 was 1,199 in general hospitals, 738 at the Mental Hospital, 226 at the Orthopaedic Centre, 61 at the Leper Asylum and 46 in the Prison hospitals. In addition, 33 sugar estates provide each a small hospital with a total of 575 beds for the sole benefit of their employees. There were also five private nursing homes, 48 static dispensaries (excluding two prisons’ dispensaries), four mobile dispensaries and two mobile dental clinics. The Maternal and Infant Welfare Service provides nine static centres and one mobile antenatal clinic. Admissions to hospitals numbered 34,846; attendances at static dispensaries numbered 738,298 and at mobile dispensaries 62,008.

The expenditure on medical services during the financial year 1959–60 amounted to Rs.14,313,375 against an actual expenditure of Rs.1,964,369 in 1929–30.

Communications

The airport (Plaisance) is run by the Colonial Government and the meteorological services are under the control of the Director, Meteorology. Air France operates a scheduled “Super Constellation” service twice a week between Paris and Mauritius through Cairo, Nairobi, Madagascar and Réunion. Qantas Empire Airways operate a scheduled “Super Constellation” service between Sydney and Johannesburg via Melbourne, Darwin, Cocos Islands and Mauritius once fortnightly in each direction. South African Airways have a fortnightly scheduled Douglas DC7B service between Johannesburg and Perth via Mauritius and Cocos Islands; the return flight from Australia to South Africa is along the same route. No internal services exist.

The railway carried 489,157 tons of freight in 1958–59. Track mileage totalled 82.

There are in the Colony about 512 miles of main roads, 231 miles of branch roads, and 43 miles of streets in villages and extra-urban areas; 460 miles of main and branch roads have been asphalted.

Port Louis, the capital of the island, is also the only port; it can accommodate ten ocean-going vessels at any one time, and four small vessels. Regular cargo services are provided from the United Kingdom by the British and Commonwealth Shipping Company, and from continental ports by the French companies Messageries Maritimes Limited and Nouvelle Cie. Havraise Peninsulaire; the Scindia Steamships Company provide a regular monthly cargo service from Bombay and the O.S.K. Line provide a regular monthly cargo service from Japan and the Far East. Passenger services from the United Kingdom direct to Mauritius are infrequent; the French vessels direct from Marseilles to Mauritius provide the better service. The Dutch Royal Interocean Lines vessels call at Port Louis regularly on their Far East–South Africa–South America service, providing a regular passenger and cargo service to and from South Africa. During 1959, 406 vessels entered Port Louis giving a total of 1,384,967 net tons.

Broadcasting

Government runs the Mauritius Broadcasting Service, which has a monopoly in the Colony. The station at Forest Side operates on 220 metres, 1,364 kc/s medium wave and 49·17 and 90·23 metres, 6,101 and 3,325 kc/s short-wave with powers of 5 kW and 10 kW respectively. In June 1960 there were 36,626 wireless licences in force in the Colony, with an estimate of five listeners per receiver.

Principal Occupations

Cane plantation and sugar manufacture give employment to approximately 4,500 skilled and 53,000 unskilled workers. Other industries are tea planting and manufacture, employing some 2,000 workers; tobacco 2,200; aloe fibre 1,400. The docks and stevedoring companies give employment to about 2,100 workers; the building trade about 3,000; Government and private services 11,800.

In 1959 there were 64 registered trade unions including nine associations of employers and two federations of trade unions with 35 members. Total membership of the employees’ unions was 26,808.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar-cane, “aloe” (Furcraea) fibre, tea and tobacco. Sugar is produced in 24 factories the modernization of which is nearly completed. Practically all the “aloe” fibre produced is utilized locally for the manufacture of sugar bags. The Colony grows some of its subsidiary foodstuffs and vegetables and produces a proportion of its vegetable oil requirements. Coconut oil is extracted at a factory in Port Louis from copra obtained from the dependencies known as the Oil Islands. The only by-product of sugar cane is alcohol, of which 19,700 hectolitres of 100° G.L. were produced in 1959.

The livestock population is estimated to be roughly: bovines 42,000 (of which 38,000 are of the local or “creole” milch breed); goats, 54,000; pigs, 4,000; sheep, 2,000.

The catch of fish in territorial waters is approximately 1,800 tons a year.

*Excluding value of sugar quota certificates.

The chief imports are rice, wheaten flour, pulses, cattle and meat, edible oils, and fats, coal, petroleum products, rubber, textiles, clothing and footwear, motor vehicles and accessories, tyres and tubes, cement, machinery, iron and steel goods, electrical goods, fertilizers, paper and paper manufactures and medicinal products.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The whole of the sugar produced is marketed by the Sugar Syndicate. Out of the saleable sugar crop, a guaranteed quota of 353,425 tons for 1960 was sold to the United Kingdom at a price fixed by agreement. Owing to the reduced crop, it was unlikely that there would be any balance remaining for sale on the world market.

On the 28th February 1959 there were 346 registered co-operative societies with a membership of 33,861, paid-up share capital amounting to Rs.1,730,182 and General Reserves totalling Rs.2,506,306. The turnover in goods and services for the year was Rs.44,173,734, including Rs.13,549,758 worth of sugar sold through 148 credit societies, and Rs.37,829,828 worth of green tea leaves sold through 6 marketing societies. No ginger was sold through the Ginger Marketing Society.
