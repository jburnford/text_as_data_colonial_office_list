Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

At the end of 1959, there were 12 registered Co-operative Societies with a membership of 1,102 classified as follows: 7 Credit Unions, 2 Marketing and Processing Societies, 2 Fishermen's Societies and 1 Thrift and Credit. These societies have savings amounting to $23,440 and assets totalling $37,532. Loans granted to members during 1959 amounted to $12,655, and repayments totalled $9,103.

The impact of these societies on the economic life of the people is gradually being felt, and it is hoped that with increased co-operative education and techniques greater economic and social improvements will result.

The 26 Agricultural Credit Societies which operate under the Agricultural Credit Societies Ordinance cater solely for peasant farmers. Membership at the end of 1959 totalled 1,281 and loans granted amounted to $53,565.

A Statutory Marketing Board has been established to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchasing, handling, storage, exportation, shipping and marketing of all specified produce of St. Vincent, provided that this shall not apply to produce, the marketing of which is already under the control of some other Statutory Authority. At present under the provisions of the Marketing Board Ordinance, 1959, only sweet potatoes have been declared a "specified product". The Board will eventually deal with the majority of crops but it is proposed to proceed cautiously, making a start with sweet potatoes only, and "specifying" other items gradually in the light of experience.

Trinidad and Tobago

Area
The total area of the territory is 1,980 square miles (Trinidad 1,864, Tobago 116).

Population
The population at the census held in April 1960 was 825,700. The majority are natives of the West Indies, of African and East Indian descent. English is spoken generally throughout the territory.

Principal Towns

| Population |
|------------|
| Port of Spain (capital) | 94,100 |
| San Fernando | 41,800 |
| Arima | 10,900 |

Geographical Features
Trinidad is traversed by two mountain ranges, the northern and southern ranges, running roughly east and west, and a third, the central range, running diagonally across the island. Between the northern and central ranges the land is flat and well-watered; south of the central range it is undulating and the water supply poor. Apart from a comparatively small area in the northern range (main peaks: Cerro del Aripo 3,085 feet, El Tucuche 3,072 feet) and Mount Tamana (1,009 feet) in the central range, all the land is below 1,000 feet. The rivers, though numerous, are unimportant. A main ridge of hills, 18 miles in length, extends nearly two-thirds of the length of Tobago from its north-eastern extremity. The highest point is 1,890 feet. About 300,000 acres, or 22% of the total area of the territory, is under forest.

Climate
The climate is tropical. There is a dry season from January to the middle of May with an average rainfall of 3·8-5·2 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December (with a short break in September) with an average of 5·7-11·4 inches per month. The average annual rainfall ranges from 68 inches in the west to 97 inches in the east. The mean temperature in 1958 was 82·1°F. The coolest months of the year are December to April.

History
Trinidad was discovered by Columbus on his third voyage in 1498 and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalized his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant in 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of representations made to the Court of Madrid as to its exceptional fertility, a royal proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to Catholics of all nations to settle in Trinidad. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, soon augmented by many French families driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the events of the French Revolution; and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

In 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces. In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

Tobago was also discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the Darling and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when some 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of a year or two these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsius procured letters patent from Louis XIV creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral D'Estrées to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis XIV restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1682, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral, the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to Great Britain in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. In 1793, it was captured by a British force and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802; again reconquered in 1803 by a British force; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad in 1888 and in 1898 became a ward of the united colony of Trinidad and Tobago.

Constitution
The constitution of 1950, which was amended in 1956 and 1959, provides for a unicameral legislature (Legislative Council) with an elected majority over which an elected Speaker presides.
In addition it provides for the appointment of a Public Service Commission, a Police Service Commission and a Judicial and Legal Service Commission. The Cabinet is the principal instrument of policy. With certain exceptions, the Governor must consult with it in the exercise of his powers and act in accordance with its advice.

The Cabinet consists of the Premier as Chairman, eight other Ministers and two ex officio members (the Chief Secretary and Attorney-General), who have no vote. The Governor may, however, summon a special meeting of the Cabinet whenever he thinks fit and may attend and preside at such a meeting. The appointment of the Premier may be revoked by the Governor if in his discretion it appears that the Premier has ceased to command the support of a majority of the elected members. Other Ministers are appointed and dismissed on the recommendation of the Premier.

The Legislative Council consists of 31 members if the Speaker is elected from among the elected representatives, or 32 if he is not. There are 24 elected (including the Premier and Ministers), five nominated and two ex officio members (the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General) in addition to the Speaker.

In the present Cabinet the nine elected members have been charged with the administration of Finance (Premier); Home Affairs; Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; Education and Culture; Health, Water and Sanitation; Housing and Local Government; Industry, Commerce, Tourism and External Communications; Labour; and Works and Transport.

Universal adult suffrage was introduced in 1946, and the qualifications for elected members were reduced. The elections held on 24th September 1956 gave the People's National Movement 13 seats, the People's Democratic Party (now Democratic Labour Party) 5, Home Rule Party 2, Trinidad Labour Party 2 and Independents 2. Eighty per cent. of a total electorate of 338,225 voted.

In June 1960 the Secretary of State for the Colonies announced agreement on a new Constitution providing for full internal self-government with a bi-cameral Legislature, consisting of a nominated Senate and an elected House of Representatives.

**Land Policy**

Policy with regard to land in the territory was modified in 1941 when the sale of Crown lands was discontinued. Leases are now granted with covenants designed to assure full and proper development of the land. The period for which leases for agricultural purposes are granted is 25 years, with an option to renew for a further 25 years. The leases also contain provision for compensating the lessees for unexhausted improvements, and for penalties for dilapidation of Government-owned buildings. Land may be compulsorily acquired by the Crown for public purposes subject to the payment of compensation.

**Taxation**

Under the Customs tariff taxation takes the form of specific and ad valorem duties, with British and general tariff rates. There is also an export duty on asphalt of $1·20 per ton (crude), $1·66 per ton (refined) and $1·20 per ton on asphalt cement. Excise duties are levied on petrol (18 cents per imperial gallon), beer, potable spirits and spirituous preparations, deodorized edible oil, lard substitute, matches, and liquefied gases (propane and butane).

Under the Income Tax Ordinance the income of a resident individual which exceeds the allowances to which he is entitled is taxed at rates varying from 6 cents in every dollar of the first $1,000 to 90 cents in every dollar of income in excess of $66,000. The deductible allowances are (a) personal $1,200, (b) wife $480 ($720 if she is employed and receives emoluments totalling $240 or over), (c) child $240 or (if the child is educated in the territory but away from home) actual expenses for board and lodging and tuition not exceeding $960, or (if the child is educated abroad) actual expenses not exceeding $1,200, (d) dependent relative $200, (e) house-keeper $200, (f) insurance premiums not exceeding one-sixth of income. Life assurance companies are taxed at 15% of their profits and other companies at 40%. Other main heads of taxation include estate duties, lands and buildings taxes, a sweepstake tax, a pool betting tax, a cinema entertainment tax, and a motor vehicle purchase tax.

It consists of notes of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100 denominations and British Caribbean coins of ½ cent, 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents and 50 cents denominations. United Kingdom silver and bronze coins, however, remain legal tender until demonetized. Currency notes issued by the Government of Jamaica are legal tender in the Eastern Group of British Caribbean Territories and currency notes issued by the Currency Board of the Eastern Group of Territories are similarly legal tender in Jamaica. The total value of currency notes in circulation in Trinidad and Tobago at the end of 1959 amounted to $42,192,698 and the total value of British Caribbean coin amounted to $1,849,421, at the rate of $1 for 4s. 2d.

### Development Plans

Trinidad and Tobago received an allocation of $4,800,000 under the Development and Welfare Act of 1945, as a contribution towards a development plan. The estimated unallocated balance of
this sum at 31st December 1955 was $2,171,515. The Secretary of State agreed to make this balance available during the life of the new Act covering the period 1955-60. In addition, a further allocation of $1,200,000 was approved under the Development and Welfare Act of 1955 and an allocation of $480,000 under the 1959 Act.

In December 1957 a new Five-Year Development Programme was introduced covering the years 1958-62 which radically revised the development plans initiated by the previous Government. The new programme called for a total expenditure of $191·3 million but was revised to a figure of $205 million in 1958. Expenditure in 1958 was estimated at $30·3 million and for 1959 $50·8 million.

Great emphasis is placed on the improvement of public utilities, especially roads, electricity and water supplies, and on other measures for the encouragement of basic industries. Special attention is given to the development of Tobacco.

The Programme provides for social and economic projects, e.g. water, roads and bridges, education, health, local government, housing, etc. Of the estimated $30,354,598 spent in 1958, water accounted for $7,338,000, roads and bridges $5,582,840, electricity $5,495,000, housing $2,959,959, public buildings $2,001,788, local government $1,875,539.

Comparative figures (estimated) for 1960 are:
Water $5,351,000, roads and bridges $6,718,556,
electricity $9,225,180, housing $5,952,303, public buildings $1,610,250, local government $4,394,303, industry $8,457,463, agriculture $2,218,267.

Estimated contribution from revenue to meet the capital cost of 1960 projects is put at $40,800,000, from Colonial Development and Welfare funds $1,600,000, and from loans and other sources $11,300,000.

Other Development

The Aid to Pioneer Industries Ordinance, 1950, provides for the granting of specific reliefs from Customs duty and income tax to persons establishing new industries in the Colony. In 1951 the Rugby Portland Cement Company Limited, in association with the Colonial Development Corporation, set up the Trinidad Cement Company Limited, with a capital of $8,000,000, to undertake the manufacture of cement. Up to the end of June 1960, the number of industries enjoying Pioneer Status under the Aid to Pioneer Industries Ordinance was 106. They included glass and glass products, time recording instruments, cardboard boxes and wooden boxes, brewing, spinning and weaving of cotton, knitted garments, poultry feeds, plastic goods including tyres, etc., electroplating, steel re-rolling, cast-iron pipes, artificial teeth, polishes, trawl fishing, pharmaceuticals, paints, oil, colour and varnishes, distemper and enamels, metal spraying, pickled meats, cement, asbestos cement products, condensed milk, flavouring oils, suitcases, wireless equipment and amplifiers, carbon dioxide gas, toilet rolls, buttons, etc., crude ore processing and refining, electrical conduit fittings, typewriters and office machines, processing of cocoa beans, neck-wear, upper leather, curry powder, etc., metal building components, coconut-shell flour, children's dresses, concrete blocks, enamel ware and galvanized hollow ware, baking powder, brushes, nitrogenous fertilizers, metal furniture, steel bolts, nuts and washers, wooden shoe lasts and heels, metal household appliances, batteries, zip fasteners, pre-stressed and post-stressed concrete products, motor vehicles' radiators, impregnation of lumber, plastic insulating building materials, refrigerators, juke-boxes, barbed wire, marine foods processing, fish oil, stock feeds, manure, etc., as by-products of fishing industry, metal containers from plate other than tinplate, industrial chemicals, mastic asphalt, sea-going craft, macaroni, upholstery, textiles, plastic covers, bags and containers, paper bags, corrugated cardboard and gummed paper tapes, tin-plate containers, assembly of electrical meters, drinking straws, vitaminized foods, dyeing, coconut coir fibre mats and mattresses, dried yeast, wire nails and staples, pulp, paper boards etc., gin, air-conditioning equipment, gramophone discs and records, gypsum tiles and panels, corrosion protection and centrifugally cast fittings.

Education

Primary and secondary education in the territory is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 12 resident within two miles of a Government or assisted school. No pupil is retained on the roll of a primary school after attaining the age of 15. Secondary schools prepare pupils for the Cambridge School Certificate and Higher School Certificate examinations. On the results of the latter, five university scholarships are awarded annually by Government.

On the 31st December 1959 there were 426 primary and intermediate schools (70 Government primary, two Government intermediate, 356 assisted primary, and six assisted intermediate) with a total enrolment of 184,143. There were also 11,679 pupils enrolled in 155 private primary and secondary schools.

There were 44 secondary schools (2 Government, 19 assisted and 23 private) with a total enrolment of 21,976 (10,297 Government and assisted, including 230 students at the Technical Institute, San Fernando, and 11,679 private). A Board of Industrial Training conducts evening classes at ten different centres distributed throughout the territory. These are attended by some 3,000 evening class students who are prepared for the Trade examinations of the City and Guilds of London Institute. The Board also co-operates with the larger oil companies and sugar companies in conducting in-service training in well-equipped trade training centres. The services of an itinerant teacher are also at the disposal of these companies. A Government Technical College at San Fernando was opened during 1954. The Department of Education conducts evening classes for adults and the Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies (situated in Jamaica) provides a programme of classes at an intermediate university level. There were over 1,700 students from the territory studying at universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Jamaica. Net expenditure on education (including school buildings) was $16,048,097 in 1960 as compared with $956,000 in 1938.

Libraries

The Central Library of Trinidad and Tobago has headquarters in Port of Spain, regional branches at San Fernando and Scarborough (Tobago) and several other branch libraries. There is also a Trinidad Public (Free) Library at Port of Spain and a Carnegie Free Library at San Fernando. In 1959 689,094 books were circulated through libraries.

Health centres and rural dispensaries are maintained in the townships and in the larger villages. A public health programme is administered through the following divisions and units: malaria, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, leprosy, yaws, hookworm, nutrition, health education, maternity and infant welfare, and environmental sanitation as carried out by local authorities. The principal causes of death during 1958 were (apart from old age):—diseases of early infancy; diarrhoea and enteritis; cerebral haemorrhage and apoplexy; cancer; cardiac and valvular diseases; pneumonias; bronchitis; nephritis; tuberculosis (all forms).

The estimated expenditure by the Health Department in 1960 was $14,868,852 compared with $1,001,446 in 1938.

The main airfields are at Piarco, 16 miles from Port of Spain (Trinidad), and Crown Point (Tobago). Eleven airlines (British West Indian Airways, Pan American Airways, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Real Aerovias Brasil, Varig, Aerolineas Argentinas, Trans-Canada Airlines, St. Vincent Government Air Service, Air France and British Overseas Airways Corporation) maintain scheduled operations through Piarco. British West Indian Airways provides daily communication between Trinidad and Tobago. In 1959 at Piarco there were 17,856 aircraft movements; 71,030 passengers arrived and 416,000 lbs. of mail and 2,411,400 lbs. of cargo were unladen. A meteorological station is maintained by The West Indies Meteorological Service at Piarco.

There are 109 miles of Government railway. In 1959 4,286,238 passengers and 356,122 tons of goods were carried. The ancillary services of the Trinidad Government were terminated on 31st March 1954 and handed over to private enterprise.

There are 2,519 miles of main roads and local roads.

Trinidad is well served by steamship lines; these include the Alcoa, American President, American Pioneer, American Republic, Argentine State, Blue Star, Booth Canadian National, Cunard White Star, Elders and Fyffes, Cie Generale Transatlantique, Furness, Harrison, Louis Dreyfus, Moore McCormack, New Zealand, Nourse, Royal Mail, Royal Netherlands, Saguenay Terminals, P. and O., Union Castle Mail, etc. During 1959, 6,545 ships entered the harbour with a total tonnage of 21,515,000 while 6,529 ships cleared harbour with a net tonnage of 21,474,000.

The main crops and products are sugar and by-products (molasses and rum), cocoa, coconuts and coconut products, citrus and by-products, rubber, coffee, tonka beans and bananas. Ground provisions, maize and rice are also grown for local consumption. Copra is now mostly processed locally into edible oil, coconut oil, lard compound, margarine, butter substitute and laundry soap.

The estimated livestock population is as follows; cattle 66,700; water buffaloes 6,000; goats 56,000; sheep 10,000; horses 1,800; mules 5,000; donkeys 3,000; poultry over 2,500,000 (this total fluctuates); and swine over 63,800.

The outturn of timber from the forest in 1959 was 3,545,000 cubic feet, split wood 228,000 cubic feet and firewood 905,000 cubic feet. There were 77 licensed sawmills.

There is extensive fishing in coastal waters but the catch is insufficient to meet demand. Experiments are being carried out in fishpond culture.

Crude petroleum and natural gas are produced in the southern part of Trinidad. Foreign crude oil is also imported from Venezuela, the refined products being re-exported. The (asphalt) "Pitch Lake", 109 acres in extent, is at La Brea; 145,418 tons of natural asphalt were produced in 1959.

In addition to the two main industries of oil and sugar, the island is the world's only supplier of Angostura bitters. Its manufactures also include bricks and tiles, paint, cement, shirts, pyjamas, shoes, boots, furniture, soap, matches, cigarettes, beer, aerated waters, biscuits, chocolate, confectionery, ice, stock feed, glass-time-recording
clocks and equipment, bay rum, drugs and industrial gases. Printing, foundry work, ship and aircraft repair are also carried on.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

A statutory Marketing Board is charged with assisting and improving the marketing and processing of agricultural and fishery produce in the interests of producers and in particular with assisting co-operative societies to dispose of their produce to the best advantage. The Board also controls the export of gros michel bananas. The other agricultural products are marketed mainly through producer associations within the framework of agreements such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, (Coconut) Oil and Fats Agreement, or through normal commercial channels, e.g. rum, bitters, coffee.

In 1959 there were 454 agricultural credit societies with a membership of 16,379; 309 co-operative societies with approximately 35,085 members and total assets of $3,593,159; 281 credit unions with 23,401 members and total assets of $2,719,327; and 324 friendly societies with 124,991 members and liquid and invested funds amounting to $2,493,787.
