Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1959 was 39° F. recorded on the 19th January, while the highest, 97·5° F., occurred on the 31st August. The mean annual temperature for 1959 was 65·7° F. and the mean annual rainfall was 16·49 inches. The mean annual rainfall at Valletta for the past hundred years is 20·30 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind which blows from the south-east.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12th June, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War, and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of
Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

**Constitution**

Following the resignation of Mr. Mintoff’s Government on the 24th April 1958, a State of Emergency was declared in Malta on the 30th April 1958, primarily to enable the Governor to continue the administration of Government in the absence of Ministers. A new constitution was introduced on the 15th April 1959 which is contained in the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, and the Royal Instructions issued on the 30th March 1959.

Provision is made under the Constitution for an Executive Council, presided over by the Governor, consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Legal Secretary and the Financial Secretary as *ex officio* members and of such other nominated members (appointed by the Governor) of whom not less than three shall be persons holding a public office.

In accordance with Her Majesty’s Government’s undertaking that this constitution would be interim, a constitutional commission was appointed for Malta at the end of July 1960, to submit recommendations for a return to representative government.

**Land Policy**

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese, but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

**Taxation**

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, entertainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties, and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every £ of the first £200.
- 3s. for every £ of the next £300.
- 4s. 6d. for every £ of the next £400.
- 6s. 6d. for every £ of the remainder.

The tax on companies is at the rate of 5s. on every £ of the chargeable income.

A surtax is also levied on incomes exceeding £2,500 at the following rates:

- 2s. for every £ of the first £500.
- 3s. for every £ of the next £500.
- 4s. for every £ of the next £500.
- 5s. for every £ of the remainder.

Under the Malta Treasury Bills Act, 1952, which has since been superseded by the Malta Treasury Bills Emergency Ordinance, 1958, the Government whenever authorized by Resolution...
of the Legislative Assembly, could raise money not exceeding the amount specified in such Resolution by means of three months' Treasury Bills. On 31st March 1960 the amount so raised was £1,500,000.

The Government is also empowered to issue loans up to £3,000,000 under the Local Loans (Registered Stock and Securities) Ordinance, 1959.

Bank of England notes ceased to be legal tender in the Island in 1949. Maltese £1 and 10s. notes are on a par with sterling, and £ for £ coverage is maintained at the Bank of England. The amount of local currency in circulation on 31st March 1960 was £20,582,000.

Development Plans

During the financial year ended 31st March, 1960, a total of £4,706,797 was expended on development and other capital works.

Since the end of the War, direct aid by way of free grant from Her Majesty's Government to Malta has amounted to over £46 million, mainly in respect of capital expenditure including War Damage and Reconstruction grants.

The Government published a Five-Year Development Plan for the Maltese Islands in October 1959 covering the period 1959-64 and providing for an expenditure of £32¼ million of which £29¼ million is being made available by Her Majesty's Government in loans and grants including £19¼ million from Colonial Development and Welfare sources.

The Plan aims at diversifying the Maltese economy which has hitherto been largely sustained by the expenditure of the fighting services; this expenditure is bound to decline because of changing defence policies and concepts.

The objectives of the Plan, and the measures being taken to reach them, may be summarized as follows:

(a) The Harbour, which is Malta's leading natural asset, is to be developed by the conversion of the Dockyard to commercial use and by the construction of modern deep water quays and other modern port facilities. A £6 million loan from Colonial Development and Welfare sources is being made for the Dockyard operation which has been entrusted to a United Kingdom firm of ship repairers. Work on the new quays and other port facilities has already started.

(b) Funds are provided for the building of a fully serviced industrial estate, on which a start has already been made, some factories being now available for letting. Capital loans and grants are also offered to industry, in addition to an income tax "holiday" and customs duty easements available under a recently enacted Aids to Industry Ordinance. Besides these direct aids, the Plan also sets out to provide or improve the basic services necessary for industrialization apart from the port already referred to above, i.e., the expansion of the water and electricity supplies and the modernization and expansion of the telephone services. Technical Education is also to be developed in order to meet industry's increasing needs for skills.

(c) The tourist industry is being built up to take advantage of Malta's climatic, scenic and historical assets. The capital loans and grants to industry referred to above will also be available for hotels.

(d) The two indigenous industries, agriculture and fisheries, are being assisted towards greater efficiency.

(e) Although the greater share of the funds is allocated to these economic objectives, substantial provision is made for the social services—primary and secondary education, health, housing, sewers and public buildings.

Education

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Primary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 114 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction, with an enrolment of 56,189 pupils; and six Grammar schools with 3,523 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded in 1769, has an average attendance of 250 students and grants degrees and diplomas in divinity, law, medicine, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts and science. The number of Maltese studying or attending post-graduate courses in United Kingdom Universities or colleges during 1959 was 42. There are 38 evening classes for languages and commercial subjects with an attendance of 752, and literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates with an attendance of 1,282. There are three Secondary Technical Schools providing five-year courses leading to G.C.E., and a Sixth Form for 887 pupils of whom 218 are girls. One Technical school for craft training—admission 14 to 17 years—provides a three-year course for 593 pupils. An apprenticeships school provides five-year courses for 316 apprentices on the day release system. St. Patrick's Residential School caters for 90 boarders, age 9 to 15. The School of Art provides seven evening classes attended by 289 persons of all ages. Evening classes mainly for emigrants have an average attendance of 2,000 persons, and 377 persons are undergoing accelerated full-time technical training in various trades, at two Government Industrial Training Centres in Malta and one in Gozo. These centres were started under the vocational training scheme for prospective migrants. There is a Government home for girls with an average total of 57 inmates. The total number of private (primary and secondary) schools is 89 with an attendance of about 18,183 pupils.

In 1959-60 expenditure on education was £1,628,224 (of which £477,888 was capital expenditure). Expenditure on education in 1935 was £149,521.

**Communications**

The international airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station. There are other service airfields at Hal Far and Ta'Qali. British European Airways operate the following scheduled services:—(a) three services daily to London. These call at Ajaccio or Naples or Alghero or at Rome and Nice; (b) three services a week to Catania; (c) daily services to Tripoli, and (d) three services a week to Benghazi via Tripoli. Skyways Limited, under a pooling agreement with British European Airways operate a scheduled service between Malta and London via Tunis twice weekly. British United Airlines operate coach class services once every two weeks between Malta and East and Central Africa and freight services between Malta and East, Central and South Africa and between Malta, Frankfurt and London. During 1959, 2,470 aircraft off-loaded 41,787 passengers while 2,470 aircraft picked up 42,541 passengers. 39,703 passengers passed through Malta in transit.

The size of the Island does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Ten miles of roads have been resurfaced with hot-laid bitumen macadam. The standard surfacing for main roads remains punctuation macadam (semi-grouting), and 400 miles are paved in this method using limestone aggregate and bituminous emulsion; 170 miles of country and estate roads are paved in water-bound macadam.

The number and tonnage of ships which entered the Grand Harbour during 1959 are:—

- 1,930 Steamships, tonnage 3,174,862.
- 214 Sailing ships, tonnage 19,902.

There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a regular passenger service between Malta and the Continent calling at Syracuse, Catania and Naples. (Frequency: June–October every 3 days; September–May every 5 days) and the Laferla Shipping Line which runs a Service between Malta and Syracuse from April to mid-October (Frequency: varying 2 to 6 sailings per week according to traffic offering).

**Broadcasting**

There are no wireless broadcasting stations in Malta. The number of licences for wireless receiving sets on 31st July 1960 was, however, 18,728. Messrs. Rediffusion (Malta) Limited operate a wired broadcasting station situated at G'Mangia. The number of subscribers on 31st July 1960 was 49,868.

A broadcasting commission to organize political broadcasting has been set up. Plans are in hand for the setting up of a Television Station in 1961.

Malta has to import nearly all the raw materials required for industry.

The two leading industries are the ship-repair yard—formerly a Royal Naval establishment, privately operated since April 1959—and the building industry. A growing number of light industries produce macaroni, canned fruits, flour, tomato-paste, beer, wine, soft drinks, cigars and cigarettes, pyjamas and shirts, edible oil, footwear, suitcases, cement tiles, bituminous emulsions, basket ware, candles, crown corks, gloves, mirrors,
buttons, tanned leather, filigree work, hosiery, nails and screws, textiles, electrical fittings, flowers and seeds, fruit squashes, furniture, glace cherries, homespun lace, ladies' handbags, knitwear, spring interior mattresses, metal furniture, pipes and smokers' requisites, plastic emulsion paint, processed peas, safety matches, venetian blinds, vending machines.

The Government currently grants exclusive rights to produce goods under the provisions of the Encouragement of New Industries Act only in those cases where the industry is of exceptional importance to the development of the economy of the island (see also section above on Development Plans).
