History

The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted for over a century and a half. When the riches of Mexico and Peru were opened up by the conquistadores, the Spaniards flocked to the mainland from the island colonies and Jamaica became little more than a supply base for expeditions to the mainland of America. The population, which had never been very great, dwindled to an insignificant and impoverished community which offered little resistance to the English invasion under Admiral Penn and General Venables in 1655. With this date the modern history of the Jamaican people may be said to begin. The last attempt to recover the island for Spain collapsed and the last remnant of the Spaniards left Jamaica from Runaway Bay in 1660. The Spaniards had imported slaves from Africa, most of whom they took with them, but a small number remained in the mountains of the interior and formed the nucleus of the Maroons. Of the present community, the founders and pioneers were colonists who came from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the seventeenth century.

Constitution

The Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, came into operation on the 4th July 1959. Jamaica then became self-governing in its internal affairs, although its position as a unit territory of the Federation of The West Indies remained unchanged.

The new constitution includes provision for a Privy Council, a Cabinet, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

The Privy Council consists of six members. It advises the Governor in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government Service and in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy.

The Cabinet consists of the Premier and not less than eleven other Ministers charged with the general control and direction of the Government. Two or three Ministers without Portfolio sit in the Legislative Council. The other Ministers sit in the House of Representatives. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Legislature. The Governor appoints as Premier the member of the House of Representatives best able to command the confidence of the majority of members of that Chamber and the remaining Ministers are appointed on the advice of the Premier. The Governor is required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, except where the matter is the responsibility of some other body (e.g. the Public Service Commission) or where the constitution specifically provides for him to act in his discretion.

The Legislature consists of the Governor (acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen), the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives.

The Legislative Council consists of eighteen members appointed by the Governor after consultation with persons speaking for the differing political points of view of groups represented in the House of Representatives, and two or three members nominated by the Premier. The Legislative Council is essentially a revisionary Chamber with powers to delay bills for a limited period of time.

The House of Representatives consists of forty-five members elected by universal adult suffrage. The constitution includes provision for the number of members to be varied between forty-five and sixty.

The constitution establishes Judicial Service, Public Service and Police Service Commissions with executive responsibility for appointments, discipline and dismissals in the Services for which they are responsible. Officers in the Public Service and Police Service against whom disciplinary action is taken may appeal to the Privy Council. Judicial officers will have no right of appeal to the Privy Council, but a Judge may be removed from office only if the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom recommends that he should be removed for inability or misbehaviour after the matter has first been investigated by a locally appointed Judicial tribunal.

Land Policy

Appreciable areas of privately owned land have been acquired by Government and disposed of under the existing Land Settlement Scheme, which is a freehold system of tenure. Crown lands (with the exception of Forest Reserves) are also available for purchase by private individuals. A few properties formerly operated on a leasehold system have now been converted to freehold properties.

Taxation

The main heads of direct taxation are: Income tax, land and property tax, estate duties and licence duty on motor vehicles. Taxes on real property are collected on the basis of improved value, but by the end of the previous financial year revaluation on the basis of unimproved value was completed in two parishes as part of a general scheme to place taxation on the unimproved value.

Indirect taxation comprises Customs duties, excise duties, entertainment duties and certain licences and fees. Essential foodstuffs are either free of Customs duty or assessed at low rates. Several industries are granted duty-free admission of building materials, plant and equipment, under special incentive legislation, and industrial raw material is, in most cases, admissible duty free.

**Development Plans**

In addition to approximately £1,960,000 carried over from previous allocations. Jamaica received an allocation of £250,000 from the £9,000,000 allocated to The West Indies under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act.

Annual three-year forward planning programmes within the framework of the overall 10-year plan 1957-67 are continuously in operation.

Provisions included in the Capital Estimates for 1960-61 are as follows:

Legal tender status is enjoyed by currency notes issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, currency notes issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) at the rate of 1£ = 4s. 2d., and British coins. Commercial bank notes and Bank of England notes are no longer legal tender in Jamaica.

Government currency notes in circulation at 31 December 1960 amounted to £10,040,117 15s.

**Education**

The University College of the West Indies at Mona, near Kingston, has faculties of Medicine, Natural Sciences and Arts and a Department of Education. The total student enrolment for the academic year 1959–60 was 695 of whom 327 were Jamaicans. Technical education is available at the Kingston Technical School, which in July 1960 had 580 day students and 1,068 evening students, and the College of Arts, Science and Technology which in July 1960 had 107 day students and 123 evening students. The Ministry of Education awarded 65 Scholarships for higher education in 1959 tenable at the University College of the West Indies, and at institutions abroad. A number of other scholarships are offered, both by other branches of Government and by individuals and non-Governmental institutions.

In 1959 there were 40 government grant-aided secondary schools with an enrolment of 15,044 and 711 primary schools with an enrolment of 258,325.

Expenditure on Education in 1959–60 was £5,338,908. In 1935 the expenditure was £226,392. The 1960-61 Estimates make provision for the expenditure of £5,815,565 on Education.

**Libraries, Museums, etc.**

The Jamaica Library Service operates a free Public Library Service for the Island. It is entirely financed by Government and is organized through a headquarters in Kingston, 13 Parish Libraries, 5 Branch Libraries, 115 Book centres, and 4 Book-mobile service points.

The total number of registered readers is 110,621 and the bookstock numbers 286,069 volumes. This bookstock is available to all readers through the use of a Union Catalogue maintained at Headquarters.

A Schools Library Service organized in conjunction with the Ministry of Education supplies 716 Primary Schools with books on a circulating basis. Three book-mobiles now serve 444 of these schools.

The Institute of Jamaica, a cultural centre of the Island, includes a general Lending and Reference Library, a West India Reference Library, two Junior Centres, the Jamaica School of Arts and Crafts and a Museum with galleries for natural history, and the exhibition of arts and crafts. Extensive study collections are being developed in all branches of Jamaican history and West Indian natural history.

**Health**

During 1959–60 Central Government spent approximately £3,523,061 on its medical services, which was offset by appropriation in aid amounting to £323,250. This figure excludes expenditure from the Sweepstake Fund, the cost of maintenance and construction of buildings, and the cost of operating the Bellevue (Mental) Hospital. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £191,207.

Disease rates compare favourably with more advanced countries nearby, e.g. the United States of America, and Canada. Among the colony's main diseases are: helminthiasis, yaws, malaria, venereal diseases and pulmonary tuberculosis. The Island has recently suffered outbreaks of poliomyelitis and typhoid fever, the first epidemics for many years.

Each of the Island's 14 parishes has a full-time Medical Officer (Health), in charge of public health services, and a staff of public health inspectors, public health and district nurses. In the head office in Kingston are specialist officers who are responsible for the various phases of public health activities, which include epidemiology, health education, quarantine, public health
nursing and control work in tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws, malaria and industrial health.

The following are the government hospitals and bed capacity in Jamaica:

- 21 general hospitals (2,856).
- Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital (126).
- George V Memorial Sanatorium for chest diseases (222).
- Tuberculosis Hospital (180).
- Bellevue (Mental) Hospital (3,115).
- Hansen Home for the treatment of leprosy (185).

There are altogether 134 health centres and dispensaries. The figure for out-patient attendance during Calendar year 1959 was approximately 960,270.

The University College Hospital of the West Indies provides accommodation for 300 in-patients. It is proposed to increase the bed accommodation to 454. There are large Casualty and Out-patient Clinics.

A four-year Malaria Eradication Programme commenced in January 1958.

Communications

The international airports are at Palisadoes and Montego Bay. Government-owned internal airstrips are provided at Boscobel and Braco and there are twelve private airstrips in the Island. A 3,000 ft. strip has been constructed at Kingston. Completely new Airports are being built at Palisadoes and Montego Bay. The new terminal building at Montego Bay has been completed and the runway has been resurfaced. At Palisadoes the new 7,600 ft. runway 11/29 is now in use and the construction of the new terminal building is in progress. Both airports on completion will be able to accommodate the largest commercial aircraft to be put into service in the foreseeable future.

Palisadoes Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Trans-Canada Air Lines, Avianca Airlines, Aerovias Panama and numerous non-scheduled operators.

Montego Bay Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, Avianca Airlines, Delta Airlines, Avensa Airlines and Trans-Canada Air Lines.

Meteorological services are provided by The West Indies Meteorological Service, air traffic and associated services by the Civil Aviation Department and aeronautical telecommunications facilities and radio aids to navigation by International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited.

The railway, operated by the Jamaica Railway Corporation, has a total track mileage of 249. During the financial year 1959–60 earnings reached a total sum of £854,000. Expenditure (including interest charges) amounted to £1,180,000. Train miles of 525,904 carried 899,577 tons of freight and 1,084,588 passengers. The line stretches from Kingston to Montego Bay and to Port Antonio, with branch lines to Frankfield and to Linstead.

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring; the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the Island there are many bridges, culverts and sharp turns; the maximum gradients are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,668 miles of main road in the Island, maintained by the Ministry of Communications and Works. There are also 4,438 miles of parochial roads, of which 2,137 miles are suitable for light motor traffic.

The principal ports are Kingston, Montego Bay and Port Antonio. Regular cargo and passenger services are maintained with the United Kingdom by Harrison Lines, Elders and Fyffes, the Jamaica Banana Producers' Association, the Royal Mail Lines, the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, the Sitmar Line and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company; with Canada by the Canada-Jamaica Line and Saguenay Terminals Limited; with the United States of America by the United Fruit Company, the Alcoa Steamer Company, the Three Bays Line and the Eastern Shipping Corporation; with the other British West Indian Islands by the S.S. Kirkdale and S.S. Herman Langreder operated by the Federal Government of The West Indies and Three Bays Line; with Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Bremen and Antwerp by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Company; and with South America and Europe by Fratelli Grimaldi Line and Sicular Oceanic Lines; with India, Ceylon, Cape Town, Durban and Mauritius by the Nourse Line (service temporarily withdrawn); with Australia and New Zealand by the New Zealand Shipping Company, Port Line, Shaw Savill and Albion Company and Ellerman, Bucknall Company Limited; with the Far East (Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines) by the de-la-Rama Steamship Lines. Bulk cargoes of petroleum products are imported from Trinidad and Aruba. During 1958 incoming cargo was estimated at 1,199,855 tons and outgoing at 7,111,473 tons.

Broadcasting

Radio Jamaica Limited (R.J.R.) operates a 19-hour a day commercial broadcasting service for the Island using medium wave and frequency modulation with a power of 5,000 watts. The Company also operates a wired broadcasting service in urban and suburban Kingston and in certain rural areas. An extra hour is transmitted daily to the latter subscribers. The Company makes available to the Government of Jamaica 7½ hours of broadcasting time per week and relays several hours per week from the B.B.C.

The Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (J.B.C.) is a publicly owned Corporation set up by the Government of Jamaica in January 1959. The Corporation started broadcasting on 14th June 1959, with a schedule of 19 hours a day. To establish the station, the sum of £300,000 was made available by the Government. The Corporation's transmitting facilities are identical with those of R.J.R. Four 5,000 watt transmitters are used in the standard broadcast band, situated at Kingston, Mandeville, Montego Bay and Port Maria, the transmitters being linked by two 500 watt FM transmitters—one at Kingston and the other at Christiana. The Corporation maintains a short-wave receiving station at Warcika Hill, and uses a large number of short-wave relays and transcriptions. The Corporation is run on lines similar to that of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Corporation, except that unlike the B.B.C. it sells advertising time and is expected, after an initial period, to pay its own way from commercial revenues. The Corporation also makes 7½ hours per week available to the Government.

The number of radio receivers in Jamaica was estimated (April 1960) to be 132,073; the number
of "rediffusion" subscribers was estimated (September 1960) to be approximately 14,500.

**Principal Occupations**

The active labour force in 1957 classified by Industrial Groups was:

- Agriculture, Quarrying, Mining, Fishing, Hunting and Forestry: 338,000
- Manufacturing: 88,000
- Electricity, Gas, Water and Sanitary: 3,000
- Construction: 41,000
- Transportation, Communication and Storage: 17,000
- Finance and Commerce: 70,000
- Services (Professional, Business, Recreational and Personal): 130,000

Total: 687,000

The industrial development of the Island is stimulated by the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Law, Cap. 294, the Export Industry Encouragement Law, 1956, and the Industrial Incentives Law, 1956. Under these Laws, approved manufacturers are allowed certain privileges such as income tax holidays and the duty-free importation of plant and equipment.

In 1958 the number of registered unions was 28 with a total membership of over 160,000. The Bustamante Industrial Trade Union and the National Workers Union each had a membership of approximately 73,000.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main agricultural products are rum, sugar, bananas, citrus, tobacco, pimento and coffee. In 1959, 20 factories processed 3,820,525 tons of sugar cane to produce 378,226 tons of sugar. Rum production was 2,886,300 gallons.

Also manufactured in the Island are cans, paint, corrugated cardboard cartons, metal furniture, beer, aerated waters, confectionery, cocoa products, building blocks, panels and boards, wire bound box shocks, sanitary spoons, electrical equipment, acid filled accumulators, gypsum products, carbon dioxide gas, jelly crystals, metal containers, plastic products, pre-stressed and post-stressed concrete products, ice cream cones, drinking straws, acetylene, holloware, phonograph records and metal awnings.

Jamaica is the largest exporter of bauxite in the world. The deposits are worked by one Canadian and two American companies, the Canadian company processing bauxite into alumina. It was announced in May 1960 that another American company which had already been prospecting in the Island would start full-scale mining operations, probably in 1963. Gypsum production in 1959 was 385,567 tons, and cement production 193,600 tons.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The major export crops are handled by the following marketing organizations:

- The Marketing Department.
- The Coffee Industry Board.
- The Cocoa Industry Board.
- The Sugar Manufacturers' Association (of Jamaica) Limited.
- The Citrus Growers' Association Limited.
- The Banana Board.

Under the Coffee Industry Regulation Law, Cap. 64, and the Cocoa Industry Board Law (Law 21 of 1957), the Coffee Industry Board and the Cocoa Industry Board were appointed on the 2nd June 1950 and the 1st August 1957, respectively. These Boards are given wide statutory powers to regulate and develop these industries.

The Exports Division of the Marketing Department is the sole exporter of pimento.

The Sugar Manufacturers' Association (comprising all the sugar manufacturers in Jamaica) provides the liaison between the sugar industry, the Government of Jamaica, and overseas interests. It deals with all aspects of the sugar industry, and sells co-operatively sugar for local consumption and all rum and other by-products.

As far as exports are concerned, during the war and up to 1952 when the British Ministry of Food purchased the entire exportable surplus, the Sugar Manufacturers' Association acted for the entire industry. The position now is that under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21st December 1951 Jamaica is entitled from that year onwards, to a Global Quota, divided into a Negotiated Price Quota and a Free Quota. The former is now sold (as from 1st January 1957) to the Sugar Board, set up under the United Kingdom Sugar Act, 1956, at prices annually negotiated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The latter is disposed of through commercial channels, as in the years before the war. There is also a small International Quota which is disposed of through commercial channels.

Through its subsidiaries, the Sugar Manufacturers' Association maintains substantial interests in firms engaged in the manufacture of commodities ancillary to the sugar industry, e.g.:

- Wholly owned subsidiaries—Shareholders in Jamaica Carbonics, Ltd.; Anhydrous Alcohol, Ltd.
- Minority shareholders in Jamaica Oxygen and Acetylene, Ltd.

The Citrus Growers' Association has full responsibility for the industry, and is the sole exporter of citrus, which is marketed co-operatively for its members. It operates two processing plants and two packing houses which, together with independent processors and packers, obtain quotas of fresh fruits for packing and canning. These arrangements do not include limes, lemons and ugli.

The Banana Board was appointed on 1st October 1953 under the Banana Board Law (Law 24 of 1953). The Board is the sole exporter of bananas and has wide powers over the industry.

On the 31st December 1959 there were 215 co-operative societies with 60,830 members, and total share capital of £888,610 registered under the Co-operative Societies Law. Of these 101 were Thrift and Loan Societies, 16 Consumer Societies, 16 Fishermen Societies, 7 Transport and Tillage Societies, 55 Marketing Societies, 2 Co-operative Farming Societies, 5 Co-operative Land Purchase/Land Lease Societies, 4 Irrigation Societies, 1 Housing Society, 1 Cultural Society, 1 Cattle Insurance Society, 5 Secondary Societies and 1 Tertiary Society.

Total loans granted by all Societies during the year amounted to £914,380; the total recovered was £658,515; the value of produce marketed through marketing societies during the year was £454,061.

Cayman Islands

Area
The Islands consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

Population
At the 1960 census the population was 8,803: Grand Cayman 7,271, Cayman Brac 1,508, Little Cayman 24. Classification according to racial origin is not yet available, but is roughly one sixth of African, one half of mixed, and one third of European descent.

Principal Towns
Georgetown and West Bay on Grand Cayman have populations of about 2,400 each.

Geographical Features
The principal island, Grand Cayman, is about 178 miles to the west of Jamaica. It is about 22 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to eight miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

Climate
From November to March it is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, and temperatures range from 60° to 75°. In the summer the range of temperature is some 10° higher and during certain periods mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown averages 60 inches per annum. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system. During 1936 a combined British and American weather station specifically for hurricane research was established on Grand Cayman.

History
The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1734. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for long a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1774 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 933, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

Constitution
By Order in Council brought into effect on the 4th July 1959, provision was made for the government of the Cayman Islands, superseding the old constitution which was established by an Act of the Imperial Parliament of 1863. The Order constitutes the distinct office of Governor of the Cayman Islands and provides for the Governor of Jamaica to hold that office, and to administer the government of the Islands through an Administrator, who replaces the Commissioner. It also constitutes an Executive Council consisting of the Administrator when the Governor is present and presiding, and two official and three non-official members. There is a Legislative Assembly consisting of the Administrator as President, two or three official members appointed by the Governor, two or three nominated non-official members appointed by the Governor, and twelve members elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The Assembly elects a Deputy President of the...
Assembly who presides in the absence of the Administrator, and two of the non-official members of the Executive Council.

The Legislature of Jamaica has power to make laws for the Cayman Islands, provided that no Jamaican Law applies in the Islands unless:

(i) it is in express terms made applicable thereto, and

(ii) the Governor declares by Proclamation that the particular law shall apply to the Cayman Islands, with such modifications as he may specify.

Land Policy

All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation

A poll tax of £1 per adult male between the ages of 18 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 20% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1939–40 | 9,500       | 14,821          |
| 1955–56 | 104,551     | 84,909          |
| 1956–57 | 116,267     | 109,508         |
| 1957–58 | 156,130     | 179,567         |
| 1958–59 | 171,746     | 173,331         |
| 1959–60 | 193,381     | 166,663         |

It is estimated that in 1959–60 £141,871 was derived from Customs receipts and £24,965 from the sale of postage stamps. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Treasury, Customs and Post Office £22,257, Education £16,633, Medical £23,307 and Public Works Recurrent £17,079.

The Public Debt as at 31st March 1960 was as follows:

Road and Airport Resurfacing loans, 1958: outstanding £80,000

Development

The Islands have, under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, an allocation of £60,000. A further £30,000, allocated to the Turks and Caicos and Cayman Islands, has been held back against future requirements. A road improvement programme was recently completed, linking the three main centres of population in Grand Cayman, and an elementary school was recently completed in Georgetown. Projects planned include public buildings, road and harbour improvements and improvements of social services.

In the last few years a number of hotels catering for tourists have been opened on Grand Cayman.

Education

There is compulsory free elementary education in 10 Government Schools; total enrolment in 1959 was 948 pupils. Expenditure in 1959–60 amounted to £16,633 compared with £1,400 in 1939. There are two private Secondary Schools in Grand Cayman. One of them receives financial support from Government.

Libraries

There is a well-equipped public library in Georgetown, Grand Cayman.

Health

Expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1959–60 was £23,307, compared with £768 in 1939. The hospital has accommodation for 28 patients. Medical Officers are seconded from Jamaica. A District Surgeon, to whom a retainer from public funds is paid, has been in practice in Grand Cayman since December 1957.

Communications

Owen Roberts airfield in Grand Cayman is used by B.W.I.A. and Lineas Aereas Costarricenses, S.A. There are regular air services between Grand Cayman and Kingston, Miami, San José (Costa Rica) and Panama City. A 3,200 ft. airstrip has been constructed in Cayman Brac and a regular service by light aircraft is in operation.

A regular monthly steamship service is maintained between Kingston, Tampa (Florida) and all three islands. There is also more or less regular communication with Kingston, Florida and Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels.

Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, but no roads exist in Little Cayman.

Wireless stations are maintained by Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. There are no broadcasting services.

Principal Occupations

The chief industry next to the tourist industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment with overseas shipping companies. Their remittances to their families enable a standard of living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, and one union, the Global Seaman's Union, has been registered. There is no unemployment.

Crops and Products

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone soil. The main export products of importance are turtle and thatch rope. The manufacture of thatch rope was at one time the mainstay of the poorer people, but the industry is now in decline.
