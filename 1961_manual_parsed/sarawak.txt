SARAWAK

Area

The area of the Colony is approximately 47,500 square miles.

Population

Preliminary figures of the census taken on 15th June 1960 show the following estimate of the population on that date. Total population 744,391 comprising the following groups:

| Group                  | Population |
|------------------------|------------|
| Sea Dayak (or Iban)    | 236,686    |
| Chinese                | 229,067    |

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of a coastal strip some 450 miles long and varying from 40 to 120 miles wide on the north-west coast of the island of Borneo. A broken range of mountains runs south-west through the middle of the island, and Sarawak lies between this range and the sea. The southern border with West, or Indonesian, Borneo, is formed by another range of mountains running westerly from about the centre of the main range. The country is divided into three main zones. Firstly, an alluvial and swampy coastal plain in which isolated mountains and mountain groups rise to 2,000 feet or more, then rolling country of yellow sandy clay intersected by ranges of mountains, and finally a mountainous area in the interior. The highest peak is Murud, 7,950 feet. The Rejang (350 miles long) and Sarawak Rivers are navigable for ocean-going ships for 170 and 22 miles respectively. Others are navigable by coastal steamers or launches. Most of the rivers have shallow bars which limit the size of the vessels entering. On the Trusan, Limbang, Baram and Rejang Rivers, gorges and dangerous rapids occur well below the sources. Lowland tropical rain forest covers approximately 34,000 square miles, or 72% of the land area of the Colony. Much of this forest is inaccessible until the internal communications of the country can be improved.

Climate

The climate is humid with heavy rainfall and temperatures ranging from 72°F. to 88°F., and on exceptionally hot days to 96°F. October to March is the season of the north-east monsoon with the heaviest rains, relatively strong winds and high seas. The remainder of the year has less rainfall with occasional dry periods lasting up to three weeks. The average annual rainfall varies between 120 to 160 inches.

History

The history of Sarawak as an integral State begins with the first landing of James Brooke in 1839. At that time Sarawak was the southern province of the Brunei Sultanate. The oppression of the Sultan's viceroy, Makota, had goaded Malays and Land Dayaks into revolt. James Brooke interceded in the dispute, brought about a settlement and was rewarded for his services by being installed in 1841 as Rajah of the territory from Cape Datu to the Samarahan River. Thereafter Rajah Brooke devoted himself to the suppression of piracy and head-hunting, often with the assistance of ships of the Royal Navy, which performed almost incredible feats of navigation and endurance. Sarawak was recognized as an independent State by the United States of America in 1850, and by Great Britain in 1864. In 1861 the territory of Sarawak was enlarged by the Sultan's cession of all rivers and lands from the Sadong River to Kidurong Point.

At his death in 1868, Sir James Brooke bequeathed to his nephew and successor, Charles Brooke, a country paternally governed, with a solid foundation of mutual trust and affection between ruler and ruled. In 1882 the frontier was advanced beyond the Baram River. In 1885 the valley of the Trusan River was ceded and in 1890 the Limbang River was annexed at the request of the inhabitants. In 1905 the Lawas River area was purchased from the British North Borneo Company, with the consent of the British Government. British protection was accorded to Sarawak in 1888.

The third Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, succeeded his father in 1917, and progress continued in all spheres. In 1941, the centenary year of Brooke rule, the State was in a sound economic position with large reserves. To celebrate the centenary, the Rajah enacted a new constitution, and set his people on the first stage of the road to democratic self-government.

During the Japanese occupation, social services and communications were neglected; education ceased; health precautions were ignored; sickness and malnutrition spread throughout the State. After the surrender of Japan, the Australian forces entered Kuching on the 11th September 1945 and Sarawak was for seven months administered by a British Military Administration, as a result of whose efforts supplies of essential commodities were distributed, the constabulary re-formed and the medical and educational services reorganized. The Rajah resumed the administration of the State on the 15th April 1946. It was, however, evident to him that greater resources and more technical and scientific experience were needed to restore to Sarawak her former prosperity. He therefore decided to hand the country over to the British Crown, and a Bill to this effect was introduced into the Council Negri in May 1946 and passed by a small majority. By an Order in Council the State became a British Colony on the 1st July 1946.

Constitution

A new Constitution was granted to Sarawak by the Sarawak (Constitution) Orders in Council, 1956, which were brought into force in 1957. Under this Constitution the Council Negri (i.e. the legislature) consists of twenty-four Elected Members, not more than fourteen ex officio Members, four Nominated Members and three Standing Members (who were appointed for life by His Highness the Rajah before Cession, one of whom has since died). The Supreme Council (i.e. the Executive Council) consists of five Elected Members (elected by the Elected Members of the Council Negri from amongst its Elected, Nominated and Standing Members by secret ballot), three ex officio Members and two Nominated Members. The Council Negri Elections Ordinance, Cap. 7, provides for Electoral Colleges and Sub-Electoral Colleges. The Electoral Colleges are the five Divisional Advisory Councils, the Kuching Municipal Council, the Sibu Urban District Council and the Miri Urban District Council.

The new Constitution replaces the Constitution granted by His Highness the Rajah in 1941, as amended by the Sarawak Letters Patent, 1946.

Land Policy

All land in Sarawak is classified under one of the following headings: mixed zone land, native area land, native customary land, interior area
land or reserved land. Only mixed zone land may be alienated under title to a person who is not a native of Sarawak. Native area land may be held under title only by a native of Sarawak and may not be occupied by a non-native.

Native customary land is land over which a native of Sarawak has established native customary rights of user by planting a crop or otherwise making use of vacant and unclaimed land. Native customary land is held under right of user only and may be part of an area classified as mixed zone land, native area land or interior area land. Before native customary land can be alienated native customary rights must be surrendered or extinguished, or provision made for compensating the holders of the right. Native customary rights may be transferred by inheritance but not otherwise. Native customary land is farmed generally under a bush fallow system with 6 to 15 years between crops, although small scattered areas are under mixed fruit or rubber.

Interior area land is generally situated well away from the main centres and lines of communication, and may not be held under title. Native customary rights may be established over interior area land only under permit from the District Officer.

Most of the alienated land is held by small holders, although there are a few holdings of 500 acres or more. Government policy is to encourage smallholders to own their land. Land utilization surveys are being carried out to assess land available for agricultural development and, where possible, planned settlement schemes are being introduced.

The Land Code, combining and revising all previous legislation except that dealing with subdivision of urban land, was enacted in 1957 and came into effect on 1st January 1958.

Taxation

The only direct taxes levied on the native population by Government are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year, and the Malay "head tax" of $1 per year which is levied on all males of working age. These taxes are transferred to local authorities, where existent, who may in certain circumstances levy a cess of a similar amount on other indigenous races. Where a Local Authority imposes a general purpose rate on all premises within its area of jurisdiction, persons living in such premises are exempted from these taxes.

Income tax at the rate of 30% on every $ of the chargeable income is levied on every company incorporated or registered under any law or charter in force in Sarawak or elsewhere. There is no personal income tax at present.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | $4,261,899 | $4,272,140 |
| 1955 | $49,774,861 | $34,431,606 |
| 1956 | $51,434,042 | $43,374,437 |
| 1957 | $52,163,917 | $50,587,351 |
| 1958 | $60,045,667 | $57,957,444 |
| 1959 | $70,371,167 | $64,944,932 |

The main heads of revenue and expenditure in 1959 were: Revenue derived from Customs import and export duties $36,632,920; Licences, Taxes and Internal Revenue other than Income Tax $3,858,786; Interest on Investments $2,083,752; Income Tax $10,101,282; Expenditure—Contribution to Development Fund $14,808,786; Constabulary $4,119,496; Education $9,502,587; Medical $5,626,127; Administration $2,821,963; Lands and Surveys $2,385,454; Public Works $5,150,987.

Public Debt

Debenture Bonds to the value of $1,529,410 at $10·00 each were issued in 1958. These bonds will be redeemed over a period of ten years commencing in June 1959; each year one-tenth of the bonds will be drawn for redemption and will be redeemed at the price of $14·00 each.

Currency

The legal tender of Sarawak is currency issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. By virtue of the Currency Ordinance, Chapter 34 as repealed by the Currency Ordinance No. 12 of 1960 and the Proclamation of November 1952, Sarawak currency ceased to be legal tender with effect from 31st December 1952. These notes and coins may be exchanged, as an act of grace, for an equivalent amount of currency issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, at any Sarawak Government Treasury.

The value of the Malayan dollar is 2s. 4d. sterling.

Development Plans

The improvement in prices for primary products during 1959 and the first five months of 1960 has made a substantial contribution to the revenue. This has greatly improved the financial position of Sarawak. The opportunity was therefore taken to review the Development Plan 1959-63. Resulting from this review a Supplement to the Development Plan providing additional expenditure of $38,736,226 up to 1963 was approved by Council Negri in August 1960. The total proposed expenditure on the Development Plan for the period 1959 to 1963 now amounts to $153,681,834 which is divided as follows:

| Category          | Amount       |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Agriculture       | $36,324,884  |
| Forestry          | $870,000     |
| Communications    | $53,121,174  |
| Fuel and Power    | $4,600,000   |
| Education         | $19,126,403  |
| Medical and Health| $9,541,792   |
| Water Supplies    | $9,063,830   |
| Miscellaneous     | $21,032,851  |

The Plan is to be financed by Colonial Development and Welfare grants, local revenue appropriations, accumulated surplus balances, rubber cess and loan funds.

The aims and objects of the Plan are to develop the economy of Sarawak and to improve and expand social services within the capabilities of the country to meet the resulting increase in operating cost. Sarawak's economy depends mainly on agricultural exports, of which rubber is the most important. A considerable amount is included in the new Plan for the planting of high-yielding rubber which is the largest single scheme and which is partly financed by the imposition of a 2 cents per lb. rubber cess. The provision for communications, which accounts for 34·5% of the Plan, is to be spent on roads, port developments, aviation, waterways and telecommunications.
Other Development

Industrial development is mainly in the hands of private enterprise, notably the oil and bauxite industries. In 1957 a Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Ordinance and a Development Finance Corporation Ordinance were enacted to encourage and assist the establishment of new industries and local enterprise. Twelve pioneer industries have already been declared under the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Ordinance, and these include cement, veneer, plywood, venetian blinds, metal containers, biscuits, and rubber and latex foam goods. The Government has spent a total of $183 million from 1947 to 1959 on reconstruction and development.

Education

At the end of 1959 there were 846 schools in Sarawak, of which 36 provided secondary education. The number of children in school, which in 1947 was 29,616, had risen in 1959 to 97,152, of whom 88,587 were at the primary stage and 8,565 at the secondary stage. Of the total enrolment, 58,718 were Chinese pupils. A small but increasing number of secondary schools are under Government management; but 97% of the pupils in 1959 were in aided schools managed by Local Authorities, Chinese Boards of Management, Church and Missions, and private committees. Teacher-training is carried on at Batu Lintang near Kuching for teachers using the vernacular and English medium, and at Sibu in the Third Division for teachers using Chinese as the medium; both training centres are residential. A recent development in primary education has been the use of broadcast lessons to schools, especially for the teaching of English in rural native schools. Under a system of grants-in-aid introduced in 1956, for which all schools under local authorities and voluntary agencies are eligible, approved recurrent expenditure in aided schools, after deducting revenue from fees at prescribed rates, is met from central government funds with a small percentage contribution from local authorities. For approved capital expenditure, up to 50% of the cost may be met from public funds. The introduction of the new grants, coupled with the big rise in school enrolments and improvements in the terms of service of teachers, led to an increase in public expenditure on education from $1,576,000 (about £184,000) in 1955 to $9,474,500 (about £1,105,360) in 1959. This figure represents some 19% of ordinary recurrent expenditure in the 1959 Budget.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Sarawak Museum, at Kuching, is the only one in Borneo. Its research activities are largely concerned with the anthropology and ethnology of the country. Archaeological excavations are also in progress. The Reference Library is housed in the Museum buildings; there are also a lending library and reading room at Kuching and Sibu.

Health

Health and sanitation are good in the towns and in rural areas are improving very rapidly. A country-wide malaria eradication scheme is in operation and although there is still some malaria in certain places, this disease will soon be nonexistent in the country.

With malaria under control and the possibility of eradication now in sight the commonest causes of illness are now the respiratory group of diseases, gastro-intestinal complaints, hook worm and round worm infections, leprosy, trachoma and endemic goitre.

As a result of a country-wide campaign in 1958, yaws is no longer commonly seen.

Special attention is being paid to the control of tuberculosis and leprosy while it is hoped in time to reduce the incidence of endemic goitre following the recent introduction of special plant for the iodisation of salt.

The total number of hospital beds available in Sarawak is approximately 1,700 of which some 200 are non-Government. 300 are for the treatment of mental diseases and a further 500 for those suffering from leprosy.

In addition to these hospital beds there are 30 static dispensaries throughout the country with a total of 195 "rest beds" for patients coming from a distance.

The medical needs of the more remote areas are provided by 14 travelling dispensaries on the various river systems and 50 "ulu" or up-country dressers.

There are 350 trained midwives in Sarawak of whom about 100 are serving as district midwives in up-country areas.

In the towns environmental sanitation is the immediate responsibility of Health Inspectors most of whom are in the service of local councils.

Actual recurrent expenditure on Medical Services for the year 1959 amounted to $5,537,603 which represents roughly 10% of the country's estimated annual expenditure.

Communications

There are two civil airports, situated at Kuching and Sibu. Malayan Airways operate services between Singapore, Kuching, Sibu, Brunei, Labuan, Jesselton and Sandakan, and from Kuching the Colony gains access by air to Hong Kong by Cathay Pacific Airways. In 1959 there were 8,455 movements of aircraft. An internal service linking Kuching, Simanggang, Sibu, Mukah, Bintulu, Lutong (Miri), Lawas, Marudi, Sematan and Long Akah is operated by Borneo Airways.

The sea and rivers remain the chief means of surface communication, although development of internal air services has recently been a feature of some importance. Work is progressing on various new road projects.

The total road mileage is about 603, consisting of 152 miles bitumen surfaced, 176 miles gravel surfaced and 275 miles dry-weather earth roads.

Regular services are maintained from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and East Australia to Sarawak ports. There are three vessels inwards to Kuching weekly from Singapore, one of which returns direct, the other two proceeding to Rejang River ports before returning to Singapore. The Rejang ports, Sarikei, Binatang and Sibu, also have a weekly link in each direction with Singapore and Brunei. Another service from Singapore calls at Kuching (pending anchorage) and Miri en route to and from North Borneo, every two weeks. The service from Hong Kong is fortnightly, from Japan every six weeks, and the ships from East Australia, coming via North Borneo and Bangkok, call every three weeks.

There are several other frequent callers whose service is not scheduled. They mainly carry the bulk imports, such as rice and maize from Siam and Cambodia, clearing outwards in ballast. The
scheduled vessels carry general cargo inwards and a lesser tonnage outwards of cargo such as rubber, pepper and sago.

Ships of the above categories seldom exceed 2,000 tons gross since no Sarawak port has alongside facilities for larger ships.

Ocean going vessels, loading at anchorages or sea berths, carry most of Sarawak's export tonnage but seldom bring import cargo. Certain localities are engaged entirely in the handling of one commodity. Tankers load bulk oil at Miri sea-lines, Tanjong Mani anchorage in the River Rejang is the centre of the timber export trade, and at Sematan, bulk bauxite is loaded during the good weather season from April to September.

Sarawak's coastal trade is carried out by numerous locally built wooden craft of light draught, with the exception of one better class steel coaster which carries cargo and passengers between Kuching and Rejang ports, the round trip taking 3½ days.

The number and tonnage of overseas and neighbouring territories vessels calling at Sarawak ports during 1959 were as follows (1958 figures in brackets):

Arrivals . . 3,697 (3,487) Tonnage 4,431,270 (4,077,459)

Departures 3,504 (3,471) Tonnage 4,291,294 (4,002,022)

Broadcasting

The Sarawak Broadcasting service (Radio Sarawak) was inaugurated in 1954, and now broadcasts in English, Malay, Chinese and Iban for approximately 14 hours daily, on two short wave transmissions (7½ kW. and 5 kW.) and on two medium-wave transmissions (10 kW. and 5 kW.). Studios, programme and administrative offices are at Broadcasting House in central Kuching. The transmitting station is about 1½ miles, and the receiving station 4½ miles, away. High quality medium wave coverage is given within a radius of 60 miles of Kuching and short-wave reception is clear throughout Borneo and in other neighbouring countries in South-East Asia. About 40,000 licences are in current issue.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population are engaged in agricultural pursuits; the indigenous tribes are almost all padi farmers but also frequently cultivate small rubber or sago plantations and collect jungle produce such as rattan, jelutong and damar (resin). The Chinese agriculturists rely on rubber and pepper. Malays and Melanau are largely employed in sago and timber, whilst Ibans, when not busy on their padi farms, are employed as log extractors in the forest, on road work or as unskilled labour in the oilfields. Numbers employed in the principal industries are:

- Sawmills . . . . 6,303
- Oilfields . . . . 1,220
- Rubber Estates (excluding smallholders) . . . 1,016
- Cutch . . . . 55
- Jelutong . . . . 223
- Road and Building Construction . . . . 2,052
- Mining and quarrying . . . . 146
- Bauxite mining . . . . 357
- Gold mining . . . . 121

Total . . . . 11,493

On 31st December 1959 the total number of registered Trade Unions in Sarawak is shown as 34.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural export products are rubber, pepper and sago. Rice, coconuts, tapioca, maize, coffee, fruit and vegetables are grown for local consumption. Local rice production is inadequate to meet local needs and there are considerable imports of rice, and wheat flour in the form of bread and noodles is used to supplement rice requirements.

Livestock are not plentiful and animal husbandry still plays only a small part in the rural economy. Pigs are kept by the Chinese and Dayaks and this aspect is developing.

Both marine and freshwater fisheries are of considerable importance, but production is inadequate to meet local needs, although the culture of fresh-water fish is increasing, and there are considerable imports of salted and tinned fish.

The Colony's present mineral products are bauxite, oil, gold, phosphate (guano), bricks, lime, stone, and gravel. Past production has also included coal, antimony, mercury, and diamonds. Reconnaissance geological surveys have revealed small amounts of other minerals, but none which appears at present to warrant further investigation. Prospecting is now concentrated on oil (including off-shore areas), coal, bauxite, and gold.

There are many small factories processing rural products scattered throughout the more accessible parts of the country—particularly rice mills and rubber smokehouses; sago factories are mainly confined to the sago-growing areas, and there are a number of mills for production of coconut oil to meet the internal trade.

| Mineral Oil(a) | tons 897 | $000 11,385 |

(a) Crude oil is piped to the refinery in Sarawak from the adjoining territory of Brunei, and constitutes most of the output. Crude oil from wells in Sarawak (54,708 tons in 1959 and 56,890 tons in 1958) is also treated at the same refinery and both crude and refined petroleums are included in the total exports.

In 1959 39·5% of domestic exports went to Singapore; 10·7% to the United Kingdom; 17·2% to other Commonwealth countries and 32·6% to other countries. In the same year 64·9% of imports originated in Brunei (crude oil for refining and subsequent re-export); 8·3% in the United Kingdom; 10·2% in other Commonwealth countries; and 16·6% in other countries.
The chief imports, other than oil from Brunei, are foodstuffs, textiles, tobacco, beverages, and manufactured goods.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are no marketing boards or statutory marketing organizations. Government provides facilities for the purchase of padi at a fixed floor price at a number of points scattered throughout the country. Control over the standard grading of sago and pepper for export is also exercised by Government.

Co-operative development was started in 1949 and has made steady progress. By 3rd September 1960 there were 173 co-operative societies on the Register engaged in the following business:

- Marketing (Vegetables) 2; Padi Savings 45; Padi Milling 22; Consumers Stores 20; Credit and Savings 78; Miscellaneous 4; Secondary (including Bank) 2.

These societies are distributed through all Divisions except the Fifth and are composed of Malays, Melanaus, Land Dayaks, Sea Dayaks, Kenyahs, Kayans and Chinese.
