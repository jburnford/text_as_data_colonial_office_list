LABUAN.

The island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 14' N. lat., and 115° 19' E. long. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of Borneo proper, about thirty miles.

The island was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846, and occupied in 1848.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, the development of which was at once undertaken by a Company which was formed in England at the time, under the name of "The Eastern Archipelago Company." Nevertheless, the coal resources of Labuan remain still undeveloped, and more than one Company has failed and retired from the undertaking; "The Oriental Coal Company," which now hold a lease of the mines from the Crown, are a Scotch Company, having their offices in Leith. They entered upon the occupation of the mines in May, 1868, engaging to pay an annual rental to the Crown of £1,000. The first payment was to have been in 1871, and an additional royalty of 6d. per ton was to have been paid on all coal beyond 40,000 tons sold in any one year. They were, however, unable to pay the rental to the Crown in 1871, and the Secretary of State conceded to them a further period of three years for the discharge of their liabilities.

The following return shows the value of coal exported or supplied to shipping during the years 1868 to 1873:

| Year | Value (£) |
|------|----------|
| 1868 | 5,677    |
| 1869 | 5,589    |
| 1870 | 7,544    |
| 1871 | 2,057    |
| 1872 | 3,312    |

Labuan has a fine port, and is a market for
LABUAN—LEEWARD ISLANDS.

some of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo, such as bees-wax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, india-rubber, pearls, tortoise-shell, and trepang, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore.

There are three sago manufactories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is likewise forwarded for the Singapore market.

The Government is administered by a Governor and a nominated Legislative Council.

Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant in aid, but since then the colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony.
