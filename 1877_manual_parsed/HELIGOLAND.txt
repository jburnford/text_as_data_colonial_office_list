HELIGOLAND.

An island situated in the North Sea, in 7° 51' E. long. and 54° 11' N. lat., opposite, and about 25 miles from, the mouth of the Elbe. Area, inclusive of the adjacent island termed "Sandy," three-quarters of a square mile. The population, as taken at the census of 1871, was 1,912.

Heligoland was surrendered to the British arms in 1807, and formally ceded to Great Britain by Denmark in the Treaty of Vienna, 1815. It continued to be governed under its antique Frisian usages until 1864, when a new and more directly representative form of Government was substituted; but this constitution not having been found to work in a manner conducive to the interests of order and good government, the legislative and executive authority were centred in the hands of the Governor, by an Order of Her Majesty in Council, bearing date 29th February, 1868. By this Order in Council an Executive Council was established to afford advice to the Governor.

The inhabitants in former times existed solely by fishing; but since 1830 Heligoland has become a fashionable bathing-place, and the old seafaring population of the island is rapidly decreasing. The Heligolanders now turn their attention to building and letting lodging houses, on the profits of which they exist through the winter months.

The inhabitants have a pure but unwritten language of their own, and are of Frisian origin.

Heligoland is a place of rendezvous for the English North Sea fishing-smacks, as many as 70 or 80 being at times at anchor in the roads.
