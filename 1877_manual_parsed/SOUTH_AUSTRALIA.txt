SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

The Colony of South Australia stretches across the whole Australian continent from ocean to ocean, north and south. Its eastern and western boundaries are fixed between 132° and 141° E. long., as far north as 26° S. lat.; beyond which the E. and W. boundaries lie between 129° and 138° E. long. to the ocean. All the islands on the coastline are included in the colonial territory. The southern coast-line of South Australia extends about 2,000 miles, and it has in all an area of some 900,000 square miles. Adelaide, the capital of the Colony, is situated on the eastern shores of St. Vincent's Gulf, in S. lat. 34° 57', E. long., 138° 38', about five miles from the seashore. Port Adelaide is an inlet from St. Vincent's Gulf, and is seven miles north-west of Adelaide, and Glenelg, the place of arrival and departure of the P. and O. steamers, is six miles; both are connected with Adelaide by railway.

South Australia was first colonized in 1836 by emigrants from Great Britain, sent out under the auspices of a Company called the South Australian Colonization Association, who in 1835 obtained a grant from the Imperial Government of the lands of this Colony. The conditions were that the land should not be sold at less than 1l. per acre; that the revenue arising from the sale of such lands should be appropriated to the emigration of agricultural labourers; that the control of the Company's affairs should be vested in a body of Commissioners approved by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that the Governor of the Colony should be nominated by the Crown. Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., was appointed first Governor, and arrived in the Colony on the 26th December, 1836.

The total area of South Australia, exclusive of that portion designated the Northern Territory, is computed to be 383,328 square miles, or 245,329,920 acres. Of this vast territory only about one-fourth has been turned to useful account. Twenty-six counties, containing 40,967 square miles, or 26,218,880 acres, have been proclaimed, embracing the principal agricultural and pastoral settlements situate within an easy distance of the capital or a shipping port. Of this large area only 6,283,881 acres have been alienated from the Crown, amounting, nevertheless, to 30 acres for every man, woman, and child in the Colony, or 120 acres for each male adult. About one in every 5 acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to sale, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 640 acres, the necessary reserves being made for railways, public highways, watering of stock, &c. This land is thrown open for selection in large quantities—from 50,000 to 100,000 acres being put up at one time. At present there is as much as half a million of acres of land surveyed and open for immediate selection. The total area of land held for pastoral purposes beyond the boundaries of the counties...
mentioned is estimated to be 188,000 square miles. The greater part of this unoccupied territory lies to the north, through which a line of communication of 2,000 miles in length has been opened by the construction of the Trans-Continental Telegraph, and the establishment of telegraph stations, adjacent to which cattle runs are already being formed, the route across the Continent being now travelled with comparative ease. There can be little doubt that the explorations now being made on either side of the telegraph line will result in the discovery of large tracts of valuable pastoral country in addition to that already known.

The number of miles of railways is 371, and of telegraphs open or in course of construction 5,000 miles, completing the telegraphic circuit on the continent of Australia from N. to S. and from E. to W., bringing the whole within hourly communication with the rest of the civilised world.

The constitution of this Colony was remodelled in 1856, and the Government is now administered by the Governor and an Executive Council of six members, who constitute the responsible Ministry, and are required to be Members of Parliament, viz., Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Commissioner of Public Works, and Minister of Education. The Parliament consists of a Legislative Council and an Assembly. The Legislative Council consists of eighteen members, elected by the inhabitants of the Colony legally qualified to vote; one-third retiring by rotation every four years, and six new members being elected to the vacancies so created. The qualification consists in being thirty years of age, and a natural born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and having resided in the Colony for upwards of three years.

The qualification of electors is full age and a natural born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, possession of a freehold estate of 50l. annual value, or a leasehold estate of the clear annual value of 20l., or occupation of a dwelling-house of 25l. annual value.

The House of Assembly consists of 46 members, elected by the inhabitants of the several districts of the Colony for three years. Any person qualified to vote in or for any electoral district is qualified and entitled to be elected a Member of Assembly. Aliens are not eligible until after a residence of five years. Every natural born or naturalized subject of full age who has been registered upon the Electoral Roll of any district shall be qualified to vote in the election of Members of Assembly. There are 33,364 registered electors. One-third of the members is sufficient to constitute a meeting of the Assembly.

No payment is made to members of the Council or Assembly in South Australia as members.
