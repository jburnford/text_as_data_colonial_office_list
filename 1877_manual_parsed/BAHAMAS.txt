BAHAMAS.

History.
A chain of islands lying between 21° 42' and 27° 34' N.lat., and 72° 40' and 79° 5' W. long. The group is composed of about 20 inhabited islands and an immense number of islets and rocks. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Mayaguana, St. Salvador, Andros Island, Great Bahama, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Crooked Island, Acklin Island, Long Cay, Watling's Island, the Berry Islands, and the Biminis.

St. Salvador, one of the islands composing this chain, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. The island of New Providence was granted by Charles II. to a proprietary body in 1670, and in 1671 Captain Johnson Wentworth was appointed by the proprietors to be their first Governor. It fell into the hands of the French and Spaniards in 1703, after which it became a rendezvous for pirates, who were extirpated in 1718 by the English, and a regular colonial administration formed. In 1781 the Bahamas were surrendered to the Spaniards, but at the conclusion of the war they were once more annexed by and finally confirmed to Great Britain, at the Peace of Versailles, 1783.

In 1848 the Turks and Caicos Islands were separated from the other Bahamas, and formed into a distinct Government, under the Government-in-Chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

Trade and Industry.
There are ten colonial custom-houses and ports of entry in the Government of the Bahamas, viz., Nassau, Abaco, Eleuthera, Harbour Island, Exuma, Rum Cay, Long Island, Long Cay, Inagua, and Ragged Island. Considerable quantities of pine-apples, oranges, and sponges are exported, chiefly to England and the United States.

The pine-apple crop is very precarious. The industry of salt raking has ceased to be remunerative, owing to the high protective duties imposed on salt by the United States.

Experiments in castor oil, cotton, tobacco, coffee, and nut planting, and other branches of industry have been commenced under the patronage of the present Governor.

Local Boards of Agriculture have been established in all the out-islands with a view to encouraging these new industries.

Constitution.
The Executive Government is conducted by the Governor, aided by an Executive Council of 8 members. The Legislative authority resides in the Governor, a Legislative Council of 9 members, and a Representative Assembly of 28 members. The qualifications of Electors are full age, a residence of 12 months, of which six have been as freeholder or housekeeper, or a residence of six months and a payment of duties to the amount of 26l. Os. 10d. The qualification of Members is possession of an estate of real or personal property of the value of 500l. The Executive Council is composed partly of official and partly of unofficial Members. They usually have a seat in one of the branches of the Legislature.
