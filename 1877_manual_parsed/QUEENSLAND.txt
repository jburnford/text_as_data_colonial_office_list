QUEENSLAND.

Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point of the east coast called Point Danger, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, in lat. 28° 8' South.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the colony of Queensland comprises 669,520 square miles, or 428,492,800 acres.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good sized vessels.

A mountain range extends north and south throughout the greater part of the whole length of the country, running generally nearly parallel with the coast at an average distance of about 50 miles from it. Between the range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrow-root, and semi-tropical fruits.

Cotton cultivation promised for some years to prove remunerative to cottier-farmers, but since the discontinuance of the land bonuses given by the Government for its production, and the fall in prices consequent upon the renewed supply from the United States of America it has rapidly declined.

The sugar cane has been successfully grown on the eastern seaboard, and the production of sugar increased from the first year of its successful cultivation in 1867, to 12,108 tons in 1874. The quantity returned as made within the Colony in 1875, however, is only 6,322 tons.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated most successfully in the neighbourhood of Warwick, on the Darling Downs. The statistical register shows the quantity of wheat returned as produced in the year 1875 as 97,400 bushels.

Agriculture, in Queensland, is yet in its infancy, but is gradually extending and will no doubt continue to grow in importance with the rapid increase of population. The land now under cultivation is given in the statistical register for 1875 as 77,347 acres.

The pastoral occupation of the country is far in advance of agricultural settlement in the Colony, and from natural adaptation of soil and climate generally, and the great extent of the territory, this will no doubt continue to be the case.

The live stock returns for 1875 are as follows:

| Livestock       | Number |
|-----------------|--------|
| Sheep           | 7,227,774 |
| Horned cattle   | 1,812,576 |
| Horses          | 121,497 |

There are 4,114 squatting "runs" or tracts of land leased from the Government at a very low annual rental in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

In 1875 there were 330 new runs applied for, containing together 20,220 square miles, or 12,940,800 acres. Application was made in the same year for 226 "unwatered runs," as they are termed, containing 14,256 square miles, or 9,123,840 acres.

There were 202 runs purchased at auction during the year from the Government for 10,971l. 17s., at an average of 1l. 2s. 5½d. per square mile. Together, the new runs acquired during the year were 758, which is about one-sixth of the total number of runs in the Colony.

The average rate of rent per square mile on the available area of runs in what are called the unsettled districts of the country is 14s. 5½d., or 1·085 farthings per acre. In the settled districts, the average rate is 2l. 1s. 6½d. per square mile, or 3·1 farthings per acre. The rents of runs in New South Wales are very nearly the same as those in Queensland, the rents of Victoria being the highest of the three Colonies.

The importance of the pastoral interests will be seen by the value of the following exports connected with this industry for the year 1875:

| Export         | Value   |
|----------------|---------|
| Wool           | £1,866,030 |
| Hides and skins| £80,386  |
| Tallow         | £43,001  |
| Live stock     | £261,785 |

Total . . . £1,551,202

Mining is likely to prove the greatest source of wealth to the Colony. The value of the exports of gold during the last two years have exceeded the value of the production of wool. During the year 1875 the exports of gold and other metals are given as follows:

| Metal          | Value   |
|----------------|---------|
| Gold           | £1,498,438 |
| Tin            | £287,879  |
| Copper         | £111,263  |

Total . . . £1,847,575

The gold fields on the Palmer River, in the far north of the Colony, discovered in 1874, have already attracted a population returned in the census of May, 1875, as 9,215 persons. Cooktown, on the Endeavour River, which is the port for this district, during the short period since it was proclaimed a township, has yielded in the Customs revenue and wharfage rates, 117,432l. 16s. 1d., and in land sales and fees 11,013l. 1s. 1d.
During the last year of 1875 new discoveries of very extensive and apparently very rich gold reefs have been made on the Hodgkinson River, a little to the south of the Palmer. A road from the sea coast, which it is said may be rendered practicable for drays, has been found to the Hodgkinson gold fields, a distance of about 70 miles, which thus connects it with one of the finest harbours on the seaboard, called Trinity Bay, of which the port has been named Cairns. A considerable amount of capital and enterprise are likely to be attracted to this new auriferous district, and suitable machinery will no doubt speedily be erected for crushing the stone, which is said to be very rich in gold.

Considerable tracts of good pastoral country have also been found not far from the new route from Trinity Bay to the gold fields, in the same district.

Valuable timber of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland and ought to become a valuable export. Excellent coal has been found in some localities; and there are other natural productions promising to add to the wealth of the Colony, but requiring labour and capital for their development.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, is found by the returns of the census of May, 1876, to be 173,288 persons, to which enumeration 24 per cent. being added for the proportion likely to have been omitted from the record, gives 177,615 as the actual population of the Colony.

The increase during the year 1875 was 17,771, of which 2,602 were natural increase from births over deaths, and 15,169 were by excess of immigration over emigration by sea.

There are 199 places now returned as proclaimed towns or township reserves, in the Colony, fifteen of which are municipal towns, with an aggregate population of a little over 58,000 persons, and containing rateable property valued at 4,054,228L.

Of the imports for 1875, the total value is given as 3,329,099L.

The value of exports exceeds that of imports, and amounts in the same year to 3,857,676L.

The revenue of the Colony for 1875 was 1,261,464L. The Public Debt of the Colony in the same year was 6,948,586L.

There are 6 banks with 63 branches. The value of the coin with bullion is given as 612,283L; deposits 2,705,900L; note circulation 349,591L.

The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 12,250, the amount of deposits as 609,053L.

The railways in Queensland show 265 miles now in operation, the revenue being 136,672L. There are 118 miles of railway in course of construction.

The electric telegraph lines show, number of stations, 112; miles of line, 4,633; revenue 36,022L; number of messages (for the year 1875), 409,000.

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, has a population of 20,645, resident within the municipal limits, and of 26,953 within the census district. The mean external shade temperature there is given as 70°. The heat is great in summer, but the atmosphere is dry and healthy. In the winter the climate is agreeable. The mortality over a period of ten years from 1866 to 1875, was 17-93.

The European immigration for the year 1875 was 5,871, about one-tenth of the immigrants paying their own passage, less than one-third being assisted, and the remainder being free, that is introduced entirely at the expense of the Queensland Government.

The land order system of immigration, by means of which as many as 36,000 persons were introduced from Great Britain in the years 1861-1866, a large number of them paying their own passages and bringing a great deal of capital into the colony has been discontinued. It is supposed that the present liberal system of disposing of the public lands of the Colony ought to be a sufficient attraction to the better class of immigrants from Europe likely to engage in pastoral and agricultural pursuits.

Land.

By the "Alienation of Crown Lands Act of 1868," the price of land was reduced and a system of deferred payments adopted, extending over 10 years. Considering that no interest is required by the Crown for any unpaid balance, and estimating this at the ordinary colonial rate of 10 per cent., it has been shown that the actual cost of agricultural land was only 8s. 3d. per acre, first class pastoral 5s. 6d., and second class 2s. 9d. The prices as fixed by the Act are as follows:

| Quantity allowed to be taken up. |
|----------------------------------|
| Agricultural, 15s. per acre       | 640 acres. |
| First-class pastoral, 10s.        | 2,590      |
| Second-class, 5s.                 | 7,680      |

Quantity permitted to be held on these terms by one person 10,880 acres.

Persons taking up land in this way are termed selecting lessees, but they obtain the fee simple of the land at the end of 10 years after paying yearly the tenth portion of its estimated value, or 1s. 6d. an acre for agricultural, 1s. for first-class pastoral, and 6d. for second-class pastoral lands, a sum of money having been expended on the property equal to these annual payments. Lessees may also become proprietors at any time after three years from the period of selection, on paying up the purchase-money in full, and after having expended an equal amount in improvements on the land. This secures occupation and actual settlement to prevent selection for merely speculative purposes. For the same reason, residence in person, or by bailiff, is required.

Homestead selections to the extent of 640 acres may be made by any person being a natural born or a naturalised subject of Her Majesty, who is the head of a family, or who is 18 or more years of age, on any land proclaimed or otherwise open to general selection by lease, provided that free or assisted passengers, that is, passengers introduced wholly, or in part, at the cost of the Government, will not be entitled to select homesteads until they have resided three years continuously in the Colony. If taken up in two portions the second block of land must be situated within 15 miles of the first, the two not to exceed together 640 acres, the lessee to reside personally on the first.

The annual payments on homestead selections are only 3d. on agricultural, and 6d. an acre on first or second-class pastoral lands, and these are to be made for a period of only 5 years. The land may be secured in fee simple by the lessee after a personal residence during the 5 years, and at any time within 2 years thereafter, on proof that one-tenth has been cultivated, or that the whole of the land has been surrounded by a good and sub-
stantial fence. Lessees of homesteads may also secure the Crown grant and become actual proprietors at any time after 2 years from the time of selecting the land on paying up the purchase-money in full, and on showing that the above conditions of personal residence and required improvements have been fulfilled.

Sugar and coffee lands may be leased within 10 miles or the coast of any navigable river, the land not being included in the leased half of a pastoral run, in blocks of agricultural land not exceeding 1,280 acres in extent, and one-tenth of it having been cropped during 3 years with sugar or coffee. The lessee is relieved from the obligation of residence, but is otherwise liable to the same conditions as any ordinary conditional purchasers.

Mineral lands for mining purposes, not including gold, may be secured as follows:—Price 12. per acre, quantity not less than 40 nor more than 640 acres; deposit required 5s., balance to be paid within 12 or 18 months—an amount equal to the purchase-money to be expended in mining before the fee simple can be secured.

Pastoral runs in the unsettled portions of the colony are leased for 21 years in blocks of not less than 25 square miles, at a rental of 5s. a square mile for the first 7 years, 10s. for the next 7, and 15s. for the third 7 years; the conditions being the stocking of the land with sheep or cattle equal to one-fourth of its carrying capacity.

The several Acts of Parliament under which land may be thus secured, are the "Crown Lands Act, of 1868;" "the Homestead Areas Act, of 1872;" and "the Amended Act, of 1875;" "the Pastoral Leases' Act, of 1869;" "Mineral Lands Act, of 1872;" and "the Gold Fields Act, of 1874."

The administration of the first and most important of these Acts has been very successful, especially in the more settled portions of the Colony, where the farmer has a market for his produce. As many as 4,484 homesteads have been applied for and granted under the Act, containing 635,202 acres.

The number of granted applications for land under conditional purchase has been 7,256, comprising 3,472,843 acres. The number of purchasers under what is called preemptive right has been 470, who have taken up 360,729 acres.

The total quantity of land sold by the Government under the "Alienation of Crown Lands Act, of 1868," and the "Homestead Areas Acts," up to the 31st March, 1876, amounts to 4,468,774 acres.

There are 28 land offices in the colony where conditional purchases and homesteads may be applied for.

The areas open to selection in the several settled districts of the colony in July, 1876, were as follows:

| District          | Open to selection | Area of runs under pastoral lease | Total |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| Moreton           | 1,299,969         | 932,284                          | 2,232,253 |

| Cook              | 18,355,780        | —                                 | 18,355,780 |
| **Total**         | **34,197,583**    | **6,757,211**                    | **40,954,794** |

Under the "Western Railway Act, of 1875," a reserve containing 13,440,000 acres was set apart, in which blocks of land containing about 5,000 acres, or, in cases where improvements had been effected on the land, in blocks of 10,000 acres, may be sold to defray the cost of construction of the railway. It is estimated that it will only be necessary to dispose of 1,000,000 acres at 10s. per acre for this purpose; 300,000 acres of this land will probably have been surveyed by September, 1876.

Queensland became a separate Colony in 1859.

* The quantity of land annually sold by auction since 1866 bears but a small proportion to the area in process of alienation, as Acts of Parliament were passed in 1866 and 1868 allowing the payments for lands selected to extend over a period of ten years.

† The expenditure for 1875 is only up to 30th June; the "Audit Act" of 1874 having altered the commencement of the financial year to 1st July.
