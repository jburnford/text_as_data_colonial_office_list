VICTORIA.

Victoria, the most populous and wealthy of the Australasian colonies, is situated at the south-east of the Continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 420 geographical miles, and its greatest breadth is about 250 such miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 600 miles.

Victoria was separated from New South Wales in 1851. It is bounded on the west by the Colony of South Australia, the dividing line being the 141st meridian. On the north and north-east it is bounded by the Colony of New South Wales, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a line reaching from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and in the whole of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in lat. 39° 8' S., long. 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the colony intersects the Murray, lat. 34° S., long. 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in lat. 37° 31' S., long. 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the whole westerly frontier, which lies upon the meridian 141° E. (as has been already stated), and extends from lat. 34° S. to lat. 38° 4' S., or more than 240 miles.

The area of Victoria is 88,198 square miles, or 56,446,720 acres. The whole continent of Australia is estimated to contain about 3,000,000 of square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about one thirty-fifth part of its surface. Great Britain, exclusive of the islands in the British seas, contains 89,644 square miles, and is therefore slightly larger than Victoria.

Industry.

Wheat produced in Victoria, in 1875-6, was 4,978,914 bushels; oats, 2,719,795 bushels; potatoes, 124,377 tons; hay, 206,613 tons; 43,647,027 lbs. of Victorian wool, valued at 3,786,481l.

The total quantity of gold raised from the date of the first discovery (1851) to the end of the year 1875, is estimated at 45,509,964½ ozs., which at 4l. per oz. gives the value as 182,039,857l.

The number of acres under cultivation in 1875-6 was 1,126,831.

There are 196,184 horses in the colony. The number of cattle is 1,054,598, of sheep 11,749,532, and of pigs 140,765.

There are 617 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation.

There are 358 miles of railway in course of construction. There are 2,629 miles of telegraph lines open, and 4,510 miles of wire.

Stage-coaches run to all parts of the Colony, except those for which railway communication is available.

Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, is the most populous city in Australasia, having (in 1875), with its suburbs, a population of 244,668.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. The mean temperature at Melbourne, derived from observations extending over 14 years, is 57° 6'.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Ministry. There is a Legislative Council of 30 members elected for six Provinces, and an Assembly of 78 members returned by the 49 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55). One of the Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years. The property qualification of Members is possession of freehold property worth 2,500l., or annual value of 250l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold or leasehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 50l. per annum. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of the Upper House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of Members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is three years, and vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856.
All Members of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid £300 a year "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament."

Melbourne is distant from Sydney by sea about 570 miles, and by land about 581 miles; from Adelaide by sea 482 miles, and by land 560 miles. The most rapid communication with England is by the monthly steamers of the P. and O. Company.
