Tasmania.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of New Holland, from which it is divided by Bass's Straits, 120 miles wide; the important gold-producing colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. The surface is diversified by ranges of hills and valleys, with occasionally large plains. Tasmania is the most healthy of all the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in other Australian colonies.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

Taking the average of 25 years, the mean heat of spring is 54°; summer, 62°; autumn, 55°; and winter, 47°; of the whole year, 54°, which—compared with that of London, 51°; Edinburgh, 47°; Quebec, 41°; New York, 51°—shows a superiority of climate over those places. Rain falls on an average 145 days in the year, with a rainfall of a little more than 22 inches.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 743 miles of telegraph open in the colony.

There is an electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to New South Wales, Queensland, Adelaide, and South
Australia, whence proceeds a line across the Australian continent to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The colony is placed in telegraph communication with New Zealand, via Sydney (New South Wales), by means of submarine cable.

Steamers between Melbourne and Hobart Town and Launceston twice and sometimes thrice a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart Town to Sydney every fortnight. Direct mail steamer from Hobart Town to New Zealand once a month. There is also a steamer trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every ten days. Sailing vessels are continually departing from Hobart Town or Launceston to all the Australian colonies and New Zealand. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Galle and London every four weeks, 48 days via Brindisi—55 days via Southampton. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 60 days. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Singapore, and Galle every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 70 days. Sailing vessels of 600 to 700 tons direct to London in summer months. Clipper ships of heavy tonnage as well as steamers of large power and tonnage from Melbourne all the year round.

There are 178 post towns in Tasmania.

There is no postage on newspapers to the United Kingdom, the other Australian colonies, or any part of Tasmania, when posted in the island.

The post office money order system is in force for orders on the Australian colonies, New Zealand, Great Britain, and Ireland, up to 10l. for each order.

The island contains 15½ million acres of land, and the islands connected with it contain 1¼ million acres: 3,863,350 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown; leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of about 12,000,000 acres, of which 1,761,003 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The colony—which is 170 miles from N. to S., and 160 from E. to W.—is divided into 18 counties.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass's Straits.

Besides the corporations of the city of Hobart Town and town of Launceston, there are nineteen rural municipal councils in the colony, each with its warden and a sufficient police, and eight police districts.

Benevolent societies, working men's clubs, homes for the poor, an asylum for the insane, hospitals for the sick, an asylum for orphans, three asylums for paupers, reformatories, boys' home, city mission, town mission, Bible societies, temperance societies, Odd Fellows' Societies, Freemasons' lodges, gardeners' societies, and agricultural associations, have been established, and are in active operation.

The main road from the port of Hobart Town to Launceston is 120 miles long, and passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in excellent order by the Government: all the other roads are under the care of trustees, who raised rates and maintained the roads and bridges in repair at an expense of 27,975l. in the year 1875.

A line of railway 134 miles in length to connect the two ports of Hobart Town and Launceston is being constructed by an English Company; the colony guaranteeing to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on a sum not exceeding 650,000l. for 30 years upon due fulfilment of the contract and maintenance of the line during that period.

The railway from the port of Launceston to Deloraine, 45 miles in length, passing through some of the best agricultural lands of the colony, is completed, and its traffic returns are satisfactory. It cost 510,000l.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; and the upset price of pastoral lands a sum equal to 12 years' rental, but not less than 5s. an acre.

Any person may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not exceeding 320 acres, at 1l. an acre, on the following terms, as exemplified to the extent of 100 acres:

| £ s. d. |
|---------|
| 100 acres at 20s. | 100 0 0 |
| Add one-third for credit | 33 6 8 |

£133 6 8

| £ s. d. |
|---------|
| Cash at time of purchase | 3 6 8 |
| Ditto first year | 5 0 0 |
| Ditto second year | 5 0 0 |
| Ditto third and following years up to 14 years | 10 0 0 a.y.r. |

And so on in proportion for any greater or smaller area than 100 acres.

When 500 acres shall have been sold in not less than 10 lots adjoining or close to each other, the Governor in Council is empowered to raise a sum not exceeding half of such purchase money for the purpose of constructing a road or roads in the vicinity of the lots.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l. The various islands belonging to Tasmania may be leased for 14 years by rent payable in advance for each year.

The Act also empowers the Immigration Board to permit any person, who has paid his family's passage-money in cabin, to demand, within a year after his arrival in the colony, a certificate to select 30 acres of land for himself, 20 for his wife, and 10 for each child accompanying him or joining him within twelve months.

And for these lands a grant will issue after five years' residence within the colony: but the order will not be forfeited by the death of the emigrant if his family remain.

The Emigration and Colonists' Aid Corporation, 22, Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, London, is the agency now employed by the Tasmanian Board of Immigration.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, flour, grain, fruit, preserves, hops, horses, sperm, oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark.

The land in cultivation in 1874, was 332,824 acres. There were then 23,473 horses, 118,694 horned cattle, 1,719,768 sheep, and 47,664 pigs. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1874-5 was 6,220,123 lbs., valued at 438,745l.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, although through want of capital and sufficient enterprise, but little has yet been done towards turning them to account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, and iron of the finest quality has been pro-
duced from them. Companies have been formed to manufacture iron from the hematite and other deposits at Ilfracombe and elsewhere, and the necessary plant has arrived from England. Tin in immense quantities has been discovered at Mount Bischoff, the whole mountain being said to be intersected with veins of that ore. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

In the elevated plateau which occupies the centre of the island, are numerous lakes, which by means of irrigation might be made to spread fertility over a large surface, and furnish rich pasture land for stock.

In these various ways profitable employment might be found for a large amount of capital and labour, and Tasmania might become one of the most prosperous and agreeable of the Australasian colonies.

Census.

The population of Tasmania is 103,663, of whom 49,020 are females. The death-rate of 1875 was 20-01 to the 1,000 of the population. The number of houses is 20,364. The black aboriginal population is now extinct.

Fifty-three medical men practise their profession throughout the island.

Three hundred and sixteen churches and chapels are erected in various parts; and in addition to the numerous private schools, there are 154 Government schools, having 12,271 scholars on the rolls; and several scholarships are maintained by the colony, the best being the two annual Tasmanian scholarships, tenable at an English university for four years, of 200l. a year each. There are also 33 yearly exhibitions from primary to superior schools, varying from 16l. to 20l. a year.

There were 29,444 persons in Tasmania who could not read, according to the census on 7th of February, 1870, of whom 14,000 were under 5 years old.

Hobart Town is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1871) 19,092 inhabitants, and 38 places of worship. The city has been much improved of late years by the addition of several handsome public buildings.

Launceston, the second town of the colony, contains a population of 10,668 persons.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17): by this Act a Legislative Council and House of Assembly are constituted, called "the Parliament of Tasmania."

The Legislative Council consists of sixteen members, elected for thirteen electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat shall be vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for electors is the possession of a freehold estate of 30l. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-two members, elected for the same number of electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court. The duration of the Assembly is five years. The qualification of electors for the Assembly is property of the value of 50l. in the district for which he votes, or household property of the annual value of 7l.; or being a barrister or solicitor on the roll of the Supreme Court, or legally qualified medical practitioner, or minister of religion, &c., resident for twelve months before in the district. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict., cap. 32.
