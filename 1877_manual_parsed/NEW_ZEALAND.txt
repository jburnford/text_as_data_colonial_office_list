NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the Middle, and the South (or Stewart's) Island. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Colony; the chief of these are the Chatham Isles and the Auckland Isles. The entire group lies between 34° and 48° S. lat., and 166° and 179° E. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles; the average being about 140 miles.

| Sq. Miles. | Acres. |
|------------|--------|
| New Zealand | 100,000 or 64,000,000 |
| Ditto of North Island | 44,000 or 28,000,000 |
| Ditto of Middle Island | 55,000 or 36,000,000 |
| Ditto of Stewart's Island | 1,000 or 640,000 |

It will thus be seen that the total area of New Zealand is somewhat less than that of Great Britain and Ireland.

Climate.

From its healthy and salubrious climate, from its great extent of coast line, and from its position with regard to the neighbouring continent of Australia, New Zealand is often called "the Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere." The temperature is, however, much more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington, nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin, nearly the same as at London. The official reports of the Medical Department show that whereas the annual mortality from all diseases out of every 1,000 British soldiers quartered in the United Kingdom was 16, it was only 5 out of every 1,000 in the troops quartered for more than twenty-five years in New Zealand.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was first visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies. In 1840, the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, and the islands were erected into a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori
wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them have fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity appears to have been established in 1871 throughout the country. It was estimated, on 1st June, 1874, that the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 45,570, all of whom dwell in the North Island, with the exception of 1,932 scattered over the other islands.

Constitution.

A constitutional form of Government was established in New Zealand by the Imperial Statute 15 and 16 Vic., cap. 72, passed in 1852. By that Act, the Colony was divided into six provinces, since increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants according to a franchise which practically amounts to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vic., No. XXI., passed in 1875, the provincial system of Government was abolished, the powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are henceforth to be exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The Act provided that the abolition of the provinces should not have any operation until the day after the conclusion of the then next session of the Assembly, excepting that in the meantime Provincial Councils should not hold any meeting. Before the next Session there was a general election, and the first Session of the new Parliament ended on the 31st of October, 1876. Nothing was done during the Session to repeal the Abolition Act, and the provinces, therefore, ceased to exist the day after the Session concluded. Provision was however made for the division of the country into counties, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, and consists of the Governor, of a Legislative Council, and of a House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Colony for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and hold their seats for life. The Members of the House of Representatives are chosen by Electors possessing the same qualifications as those who vote for the Provincial Councillors. Every elector is qualified to become also a Member. The House of Representatives now consists of 88, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives.*

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native Government were transferred in 1868 from the Imperial to the Colonial Government. In 1864, the seat of the general Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Statistics.

The population of New Zealand on the 1st July, 1876, amounts to 481,077 souls, of whom 45,470 are Maoris, and 5,976 are Chinese.

* The Members of both branches of the Legislature now receive £17/10s. each for every session, to cover the expenses of their attendance.

The revenue, the trade, and the other elements of material prosperity have increased largely during the ten years preceding the census of 1874. Thus the revenue was in 1861, £91,464l.; and in 1875, the total ordinary and territorial revenue of both the General and Provincial Governments was as follows:—Ordinary revenue, 2,047,284l.; territorial, 688,722l.; incidental, 77,972l.; total 2,813,928l. The population of the chief towns was in 1874 as follows:—Wellington, (the seat of the general Government), 10,547; Dunedin, 18,499; Auckland, 12,775; Christchurch, 10,297; Nelson, 5,662. All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold exported from the colony up to 31st December, 1875, was valued at nearly 31 millions sterling; and the annual production is now about 14 millions sterling. The wool exported in 1875 amounted to 54,401,540 lbs., valued at 3,898,155l. In 1855 it amounted to 1,772,844 lbs., valued at 98,104l. The live stock in New Zealand in 1874 was:—Horses, 99,859 for 28,275 in 1861; cattle, 494,917; sheep, 11,704,853 for 2,761,388 in 1861. The number of acres under cultivation in 1876 was 557,601, exclusive of land laid down to grasses.

The system of Government Life Insurance has worked remarkably well. The first quinquennial examination was made last year by eminent actuaries resident in England, and their report was highly satisfactory.

Public Works Policy.

In 1870, the Immigration and Public Works Act and cognate Acts were passed, and the policy contained in them may be shortly described as follows:—

The colony was to incur a liability, spread over a course of years, amounting to about ten millions, which were to be expended in specified proportions on the under-mentioned objects:—

1. Immigration.
2. Main railways throughout each island.
3. Roads through the interior of the North Island.
4. The purchase of native land in the North Island.
5. The supply of water on gold-fields.
6. The extension of telegraph works.

The administration of these services was vested in the General Government, and the responsibility, subject to some exceptions in which its action depended on the previous concurrence of provincial authorities, devolved on the General Government. These exceptions have been abolished by subsequent legislation.

For the better working of these Acts, two departments have been organized, called the Immigration Department and the Public Works Department.

Since 1870 the Agent-General for New Zealand has despatched to the colony 79,589 souls, and there have been despatched from the continent of Europe 7,934 souls.

Since its organization, the Public Works Department has constructed in the North Island dray and horse roads to the extent of 1,832 miles, at a cost of about 501,654l., including 320 bridges, opening up nearly all parts of the North Island for settlement.

In the South Island, similar roads have been completed principally on the west coast, to the extent of 270 miles, at a cost of about 198,880l.
It may here be remarked, that before the creation of the Public Works Department of the General Government, many thousands of miles of good and substantial roads had been constructed by the various Provincial Governments throughout the colony.

The construction of railways has been very vigorously proceeded with. The department has contracted for the completion of 983 miles of railway throughout the country. In addition to this, Parliament has sanctioned a further length of 97 miles, for which surveys and plans are rapidly being prepared. The whole of the above railways are to cost, when completed, with their equipments, about 7,000,000l. It is estimated that there are now between 8,000 and 4,000 men employed on public works.

Included in the lines under contract, there are 549 miles of railway now open and in full working order. There are also 147 miles of railway open or being constructed by the Provincial Governments, making a total throughout the colony of 1,177 miles of railway either open or in various stages of progress.

The railway system of the colony is indicated in the accompanying map of the islands.

The Minister for Public Works in his last statement estimated that the railways open for traffic would yield next year a net revenue of 3 per cent. on their capitalized cost.
