BERMUDAS,

Or Somers' Islands, a cluster of about 100 small islands, situated on the western side of the Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 32° 15' N. and long. 64° 51' W., at a distance of about 580 miles from the nearest land, viz., Cape Hatteras in North Carolina.

Fifteen or sixteen of these islands are inhabited; the rest are of inconsiderable size, the largest, or Main Island, containing less than 16 square miles of land, and nowhere exceeding 3 miles in breadth.

The islands extend from N.E. to S.W. in a curved line for about 20 miles, bending inwards at both extremities, so as to enclose spacious and secure harbours.

Besides the main island, on which the town of Hamilton, the present seat of Government, is situated, the principal islands are St. George's, where the ancient town of St. George, the former capital, stands; Ireland Island, where the dockyard is established; Boaz and Watford Islands, occupied entirely by a military detachment, formerly a convict establishment; Somerset, St. David's, Smith's, Cooper's, Nonsuch, Godet's, Port's, and River's. With the exception of one break between Somerset and Watford Islands, there is continuous communication by bridges from St. George's to Ireland Island.

The climate has been long celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The Islands produce arrowroot of a fine quality, and an indigenous cedar of great durability, well adapted for ship-building and house-timber.

A few whales are occasionally taken in the neighbouring waters. Turtle are common.

The islands derive their name from Bermudez, a Spaniard, who sighted them in 1515. The earliest account of them is given by Henry May, who was cast away upon them in 1598. They were first colonized by Admiral Sir George Somers, who was shipwrecked there in 1609, on his way to Virginia. On his report, the Virginia Company claimed them, and obtained a charter for them from James I. in 1612. This company sold their right for 2,000l. to an association of 120 persons, who obtained a new charter in 1616, incorporating them as the Bermuda Company, and granting them very extensive powers and privileges.

Representative government was introduced in 1620. In 1621 the Bermuda Company in London made a Body of Ordinances for the Government of the Colony. During the civil war, great numbers of emigrants from England were attracted thither by the favourable reports of the climate and soil. Towards the end of the reign of Charles II., grave complaints were made by the inhabitants of the misgovernment of the plantation by the Company; and its charter was annulled by process of Quo Warranto, at Westminster, in 1684-85. Since then the Governors have been appointed by the Crown, and laws for the Colony enacted by a local legislature, consisting of the Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The lands belonging to the company were forfeited to the Crown on the annulment of their charter, and, with the exception of some reserved for public uses, were granted in 1759 to purchasers on small quit-rents, extinguishable on the payment of a fixed sum of money.

During the revolutionary war in North America the inhabitants suffered great privations from the scarcity of food; and although they export largely certain articles of agricultural produce, especially potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and arrowroot, they are still dependent on foreign supplies for all the flour and most of the meat consumed.

In 1784 a printing-press was introduced.

Early in the present century the importance of the Bermudas as a naval station came to be recognized. Ireland Island was purchased exclusively by the Government, and a Dockyard established there. By Order in Council, dated June 23, 1824, the Bermudas were declared a place where male convicts might be kept at hard labour on the public works; but these islands never were made a penal settlement, strictly speaking, where convicts might be discharged. The establishment was broken up in 1863.

On the abolition of slavery in 1834, the system of temporary apprenticeship of the emancipated slaves, permitted by the Act of Parliament in the slave-holding colonies, was dispensed with by the local legislature of Bermuda, so as to entitle the slaves to their absolute freedom six years sooner than was required by Parliament. They and their descendants now form more than a numerical half of the entire population. (See page 22).

In 1846, a lighthouse, visible at more than 30 miles' distance, was erected on the highest land in the Colony; the light being 362 feet above the sea. A public library was established in 1839. In 1871 the Island of St. George's was connected with the main island by a causeway and road 2 miles in length, commenced in 1866, and completed at a cost of nearly 30,000l. An iron girder swing-bridge still permits the passage of vessels.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, and a Privy Council, consisting at present of 9 members, appointed by the Crown, who also act as a Legislative Council. There is a House of Assembly of 36 members, consisting of four representatives from each parish. There are 854 electors. The qualification is possession of a freehold of not less than 60l. value. The qualification for a member is possession of a freehold rated at 240l. The last general election was in 1875; and the average duration of the session is 135 days, although during that period they usually only sit 2 or 3 days in a week. The members of the Privy Council, the Legislative Council, and Assembly are paid for their attendance. The Bermudas, since 1844, have been annexed to the episcopal diocese of Newfoundland. There is an episcopal parish church in each of the nine parishes. They are divided into five livings, of which the parish of St. George constitutes one, and each of the other livings comprises two adjoining parishes, besides which, there are an Episcopal Church in Hamilton, two Presbyterian Churches, two Wesleyan, and one Roman Catholic.
chapel, and a number of chapel schools of different denominations. The Episcopal Methodists have recently made great progress among the coloured population; but of the whites 70 per cent., and of the coloured race 68 per cent., still belong to the Church of England.
