CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is washed by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north by the Orange River, on the north-east by Natal, on the east by Native Kaffraria. The Cape Colony, with adjacent territories (Basutoland and the Transkei), contains an area of about 250,000 square miles; the area of the Colony being 199,950 square miles.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, it was, however, in 1856, constituted a separate Colony.

By an Act of the Colonial Legislature, No. 12 of 1871, the country known as Basutoland—which on the 13th March, 1868, had been proclaimed British territory—was annexed to the Cape. In consideration, however, of the peculiar circumstances of the Basuto community, the incorporation of the country was expressly declared not to render it subject to the general law of the Colony; but its affairs are for the present administered by the Governor, who has appointed an Agent and Resident Magistrates in the Territory.

History and Conquest.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1652 the Colony was settled by the Dutch East India Company, under Van Riebeeck. The aboriginal Hottentots were the people with whom the Dutch came in contact, but they treated inland. Between 1655-1690 an immigration of Huguenots took place, but as these refugees did not exceed 300 in number they soon mingled with the inhabitants of the country. The Cape remained in possession of the Dutch till the year 1795, when the British Government took possession, but at the Peace of Amiens, 1802, it was ceded to its former possessors. In 1806 it was again taken by the English, to whom it was confirmed at the General Peace, 1815, and it has since continued a British Colony.

Between 1803-1806, while under the Batavian Government, the Colony made rapid progress, compared with its slow advancement under the Dutch East India Company. In 1820 the British settlers, to the number of 4,000, began to occupy the eastern frontier of the Colony. Eleven years later the first Kaffir war commenced, and it was not ended until 1835. 1838 is noticeable for the abolition of slavery. Between 1846 and 1847 the second native war devastated the land, and the peace which followed was of short duration, since in 1850 the struggle was again renewed, and the last but most terrible Kaffir war was not brought to a close until 1853. The first Cape Parliament held its opening session in the following year.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to people of European birth: the temperature at Cape Town, by tables compiled by Sir Thomas Maclear, Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope, is shown to be less variable than in most countries: the average temperature in winter is but 14-86° below that of summer: the mean temperature is 61-28°, the highest is 96-8°, the lowest 87-70°. The summer begins in November and lasts till April, when winter commences.

Consumption, in its early stages, has been entirely eradicated by residence at the Cape.

In the western portions of the Colony the rain falls during the winter months; but in other parts the summer is the wet season.

Industries.

The colonists at the Cape are chiefly employed in the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and in the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of this Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked.

Ostrich breeding is now carried on with marked success in many parts of the Colony, and bids fair to rescue the finest and most valuable of existing struthious birds from otherwise inevitable extinction. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in several districts.

The chief exports of the Colony are aloes, argol, copper ore, grain, ostrich feathers, fish, dried fruit, angola hair, hides, horns, ivory, diamonds, skins, wine, and wool.

The progress of the Colony may be judged from the Tables further on, which show the imports to have risen in nineteen years from a million and a-half to more than five millions and a-half.

Railways and Public Works.

Under Act 15 of 1872, the Government took over the Wellington Railway at a cost of 780,000l., since then the Uitenhage Railway at 63,760l., and under Act 8 of 1876 it has acquired the Wynberg Line for 75,000l.

By an Act of 1874, the Cape Government was
authorized to spend a sum not exceeding £4,805,080 in Railway Extension. The contemplated extensions amount to about 790 miles of iron road, and as originally devised, are shown in the accompanying map of South Africa.

Western Railway System.—The Worcester line is now open for traffic as far as Worcester, 109 miles from Cape Town. On the Beaufort Western Extension, 34 miles of earthworks completed, and good progress made with two tunnels, etc. A direct line of 17 miles long has also been finished, joining Klapmutsz and Dinton Road, the old line being continued as a loop. On the Malmesbury line 9 miles of earthworks constructed.

East London and Queenstown Railway.—39 miles permanent way have been laid; 57 miles telegraph finished, and 61 miles of earthworks. Stations, etc., are in a forward state. Part of the rolling stock is ready for use. It was the expectation that the line would be opened to King William's Town, 40 miles from East London, before the end of 1876.

The Midland line runs through Uitenhage (21 miles from Port Elizabeth), and will shortly be open to Centlivres, 10 miles from Uitenhage.

On the North-Eastern Railway trains run as far as Sand Flats, 54 miles from Port Elizabeth, but the permanent way is completed up to the 66th, and earthworks to 75th mile. A branch line to Grahamstown is also in progress.

The total expenditure by Government on railways up to the 31st December, 1875, was:

|                  | £       |
|------------------|---------|
| Western System   | 659,802 |
| Midland and North-Eastern | 806,631 |
| East London and Queenstown | 367,199 |
| General charges  | 1,577   |

There are upwards of 2,640 miles of telegraph open, and about 350 miles are in course of construction.

The total amount expended by the department of the Chief Inspector of Public Works (for roads, bridges, buildings, etc.) in 1875 was £220,068.

Harbour works on an extensive scale are being carried out at Cape Town, East London, Port Alfred, and Port Elizabeth. The Government outlay to December 31, 1875, on harbour improvements was: East London, £95,163; Port Elizabeth, £46,298; Port Alfred, £45,755. The Breakwater and "Alfred Docks" in Table Bay were executed at a cost of £443,201. A graving dock 420 feet long, 65 and 90 feet wide, and 27 feet deep, is being made at an estimated cost of £69,000. A railway from the docks to the Cape Town terminus.

Mines and Minerals.

A rich mine of Manganese ore, yielding seventy to ninety per cent., is being worked in the mountains opposite the Paarl, a town 35 miles distant from Cape Town by rail. An aerial wire tramway, 5 miles long, runs from the mine.

The Ookiep mine of the Cape Copper Company, in Namaqualand, is believed to be one of the richest in the world. The yield is 1,000 tons a month, with percentage of 33. Between Port Nolloth and Ookiep the same Company has constructed a railway of 2 ft. 6 in. gauge, ninety miles long, at a cost of £158,100.

Coal beds are very extensive in the Stormberg Mountains to north of Queenstown. The coal has proved itself equal to Welsh. From one mine 457 tons of coal were raised. Near Uitenhage is a salt pan, valued at £18,000; the annual yield of salt is worth £2,500.

Education.

The educational progress of the colony has kept pace with its advancement in wealth and prosperity. In the colony, Transkei and Basutoland, at end of 1875, there were 641 Government schools, attended by 54,167 children, on which the State expended £38,754, the local expenditure being £43,595. 91 schools, with 10,266 scholars, and having 7,593 spent on them, supplied in 1874 the educational wants of the people at the Cape.

Under Act No. 16 of 1878, was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, which has power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D.

Chancellor, Hon. Wm. Porter, C.M.G.; Vice-Chancellor, Langham Dale, Esq., LL.D., M.A.

The Council consists of 20 members. The graduates number 59, and the undergraduates 119. The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is made up by endowments, etc.

Conveyance.

Negotiations have been concluded for the establishment of weekly communication between England and the Cape, and vice versa, under contracts with Messrs. Donald Currie & Co. and the Union Steamship Company. The steamers will leave England on Fridays and the Cape on Tuesdays; the limit of the passage is 26 days, but premiums are offered for quicker runs. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. Steamers leave Table Bay twice a month for Natal (about 1,000 miles), calling at Port Elizabeth and East London, to land and embark passengers. They usually leave about 48 hours after the arrival of the arrival of the English mail. Passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, Natal four to five. Steamers leaving Table Bay once a month go on to Zanzibar, touching at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane, Quillimane, and Mozambique. Arrangements are in progress for establishing a weekly mail-communication with Natal.

Chief Towns.

Cape Town, which has a population of 33,239, and with suburbs, 45,240, is laid out at right angles, and contains numerous handsome shops, offices, and churches. The finest building is the edifice containing the Library and Museum, the former of which has upwards of 40,000 volumes on its shelves.

Port Elizabeth, the second town of the Colony, has a population of 13,049; and Graham's-town, one of 6,903; King William's Town, 5,169; Paarl, 5,760; Graaff Reinet, 4,562.

Government.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Local Parliamentary (or "Responsible") Government was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to
the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872. There is a Legislative Council of 21 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 68 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony; 42,983 electors in 1874. The Colonial Ministers are the Colonial Secretary (who is Premier), the Treasurer-General, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. There is an election at the end of every five years for the Council, when eleven and ten Members are elected for western and eastern divisions respectively.

Act No. 18 of 1874 (which does not take effect for five years) provides for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of £2,000, or movable property worth £4,000. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers) and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified by possession of property, or receipt of salary or wages, or not less than £50 per annum, or not less than £25 with board and lodging.

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The Judicial establishment comprises the "Supreme Court" of three Judges, who hold Sessions in Cape Town and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, and "The Eastern Districts Court," the two Judges of which hold Sessions in Grahamstown and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation.

Native Affairs.

Everywhere increase of tillage, trade, and personal property are reported, and a growing desire for European clothes and other commodities of civilized life. The sole vice of the people appears to be a tendency to brandy drinking, but this is not carried to outrageous excess. The most marked progress is reported from Basutoland, which is under the able superintendence of Mr. C. D. Griffith, Governor's Agent. This territory, when taken over by Great Britain, was in a pitiable state of desolation and anarchy. It is now peaceable and prosperous, and a feeling of attachment to the British Government is everywhere manifested by the people, if not by their chiefs.

The country is about 150 miles long and 50 wide, and contains about 8,000 square miles.

This land of mountain and grass is well watered and enjoys a delicious climate. The scenery is grand and in many parts extremely beautiful.

Population, 1875.—European, 378

Native, 127,323

Stock, etc.—35,357 horses, 207,732 cattle, 303,080 sheep, 215,485 goats, 15,635 pigs, 2,749 ploughs, 298 harrows.

Revenue, 1875.—£16,523l.

Expenditure, 1875.—£12,773.

Productions.—Wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron and copper, and coal have been found and is used in some parts.

Considerable progress has also been made in settling the affairs of native Kaffraria beyond the Kei. The Fingoes of this country are, indeed, regarded as evincing a greater aptitude for civilization than any other branch of the Kaffir race. Letters Patent have been issued for the annexation of Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and No-man's-land (Griqualand, E.), and the Cape Parliament in 1876 adopted resolutions advising annexation of Tembuland (Transkei), and country near Walwich Bay (north of the Orange river). The Governor of the Colony in 1875 accepted from Adam Kok a surrender of his functions of government over the East Griquas, settled in No-man's-land at the northern end of the Transkei Territory. The affairs of the central part or basin of St. John's River are not so settled. The Pondos, who are the most powerful tribe in that quarter, have not a British resident with them, and disturb the peace of neighbouring tribes.
