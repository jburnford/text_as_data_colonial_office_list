It consists of a long, high mountain called The Rock and a sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles and its greatest breadth nearly 1 mile.

Communications

There is no civil airfield in the Colony, but restricted use of the R.A.F. aerodrome at North Front by civil aircraft is permitted, subject to termination if military considerations so require. British European Airways operate frequent services between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, via Madrid and Bordeaux. Gibraltar Airways operate a daily service (four/five flights) to and from Tangier.

The length of road open for traffic is 54 miles in the city, 4 miles in the south district and about 3½ miles in the area of North Front and Catalan Bay. All roads are suitable for motor traffic.

- Italia Line, New York/Naples/Genoa .. fortnightly

Approximately one cargo vessel a week arrived from the United Kingdom. A passenger and car ferry service to and from Tangier is operated by the Bland Line. There is also a daily passenger ferry service between Gibraltar and Algeciras.

Broadcasting

There is no wireless broadcasting system in Gibraltar, and those desiring to obtain British programmes listen to short-wave transmissions from the B.B.C. There is a local radio distribution service, operated by the military authorities for military personnel, which also relays programmes from the B.B.C.

Principal Occupations

More than half of the male wage-earners in Gibraltar, of whom a large proportion are Spaniards entering for work daily, are employed in one or other of the Service Departments, the Colonial Government, or the City Council. Commercial enterprises provide employment for a substantial number of clerical workers in shipping offices and trading agencies. Hotels, catering services, retail distributing trades and stevedoring are the other main sources of private employment. Other sources of employment are the main local industries—the processing of tobacco and the roasting and blending of coffee. There is also a fish and fruit canning factory.

At the end of December 1952 the total registered labour force was 19,834. There are 14 registered trade unions in the Colony with an estimated total paid-up membership of some 2,750.
