TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

Area
The total area of the Colony is 1,980 square miles (Trinidad 1,864, Tobago 116).

Population
This was estimated to number 669,650 at 31st December, 1952. The majority are natives of the West Indies, of African and East Indian descent. The racial groups at the 1946 census were: African 47%, East Indian 35%, Mixed or coloured 14%, European 3%, Chinese 1%. English is spoken generally throughout the Colony.

Geographical Features
Trinidad is traversed by two mountain ranges, the northern and southern ranges, running roughly east and west, and a third, the central range, running diagonally across the island. Between the northern and central ranges the land is flat and well-watered; south of the central range it is undulating and the water supply poor. Apart from a comparatively small area in the northern range (main peaks: Cerro del Aripo 3,085 feet, El Tucuche 3,072 feet) and Mount Tamana (1,009 feet) in the central range, all the land is below 1,000 feet. The rivers, though numerous, are unimportant. A main ridge of hills, 18 miles in length, extends nearly two-thirds of the length of Tobago from its north-eastern extremity. The highest point is 1,890 feet. About 578,250 acres (or 46%) of the total area of the Colony is under forest.

Climate
The climate is tropical. There is a dry season from January to the middle of May with an average rainfall of 2-3 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December (with a short break in September) with an average of 8-10 inches per month. The average annual rainfall ranges from 70 inches in the west to 90 inches in the east. The mean temperature in 1952 ranged from 77·6° to 82·1°. The coolest months of the year are December to April.

History
Trinidad was discovered by Columbus on his third voyage in 1498 and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalized his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of representations made to the Court of Madrid as to its exceptional fertility, a royal proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, soon augmented by many French families driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the events of the French Revolution; and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

In 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces. In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

Tobago was also discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the Darling and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealander were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampson procured letters patent from Louis XIV creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral Estras to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis XIV restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral, the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to Great Britain in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. In 1793, it was captured by a British force and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802; again reconquered in 1803 by a British force; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Constitution
The Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council, 1950, provides for a Legislative Council of three ex officio, five nominated and 18 elected members, presided over by a Speaker appointed by the Governor from outside the Council; and an Executive Council consisting of the Governor as Chairman, three ex officio, one nominated and five elected members elected by the Legislative Council. Unofficial members of
the Executive Council may be charged with the administration of particular departments and subjects. In the present Executive Council the five elected members have been charged with the administration of Agriculture and Lands, Communications and Works, Education and Social Services, Health and Local Government, and Labour, Industry and Commerce.

Adult suffrage was introduced in 1946. The first general election under the 1950 constitution was held on 18th September, 1950, and 70% out of a total electorate of 282,989 voted.

Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad in 1888 and in 1898 became a ward of the united colony of Trinidad and Tobago.

Land Policy

Policy with regard to land in the Colony was modified in 1941 when the sale of Crown lands was discontinued. Leases are now granted with covenants designed to assure full and proper development of the land. The period for which leases for agricultural purposes are granted is 25 years, with an option to renew for a further 25 years. The leases also contain provision for compensating the lessees for unexhausted improvements, and for penalties for dilapidation of Government-owned buildings. Individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives. A small amount of Crown land is acquired mainly for public purposes.

Taxation

Taxation takes the form under the Customs tariff of specific and ad valorem duties, with British preferential and general tariff rates. There is an export duty on asphalt of $1.20 per ton (crude) and $1.66 per ton (refined). The excise duty on rum is $6.00 per gallon and on petrol 9 cents per gallon. Under an Income Tax Ordinance, the first $1,200 of an individual's income is free of tax, and then for the first additional $1,000 the rate is 10 cents for every $1; but this rate is increased for every additional $1,000. A personal allowance of $480 is made for a wife and $240 for each child in the Colony and the amount actually expended for education, board and lodging (not exceeding $1,200) for each child educated outside the Colony. The rate for life assurance companies is 15% and for other companies 40%. Other main heads of taxation include estate duties, lands and buildings taxes, a sweepstake tax and a cinema entertainment tax.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 13,445,000  | 12,230,000      |
| 1948 | 45,311,000  | 38,611,000      |
| 1949 | 50,877,000  | 42,330,000      |

| 1952 | 66,785,000  | 62,489,000      |
| 1953 | 60,435,000* | 68,373,000*     |

*Approved estimates.

It was estimated in 1952 that 30% ($20 m.) of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 40% ($27 m.) from tax on incomes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Public Debt $3.2 million; social services (including health, education and old age pensions) $15.9 million; works and hydraulics extraordinary and annually recurrent $9.8 million; railways and telegraphs $3 million; special services (food subsidies, etc.) $4.3 million; subventions $2.6 million; and police $3.5 million.

The Public Debt at the end of 1952 amounted to $52.9 million ($79 per capita) of which $12.7 million was issued locally and $40.2 million in the United Kingdom. The Colony's surplus balances at 31st December, 1952, stood at $38.9 million.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) on behalf of Barbados, British Guiana, Leeward Islands, Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. It consists of notes of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100 and United Kingdom silver and bronze coins. (The British Caribbean currency notes replaced Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad Government and Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.) currency notes in August 1951.) Total currency in circulation in Trinidad at the end of 1952 amounted to $22,656,957. The B.W.I.$4.80 = £1 sterling.

Development Plans

Trinidad and Tobago received an allocation of $4,800,000 under the Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a development plan. In 1950 a Five-Year Economic Programme was drawn up to spend about $38,000,000 between 1951 and 1955. The money is to be found from the following sources:

- Colonial Development and Welfare grant: $4,400,000
- Surplus balances: $6,000,000
- Loan funds: $28,000,000

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- Administration (buildings and quarters): 5.4%
- Economic development (agriculture, roads, harbours, rice production): 16.1%
- Social services (health, schools, housing, drainage): 19%
- Self-balancing (water, railway, electricity): 59.5%

Other Development

The Aid to Pioneer Industries Ordinance, 1950, provides for the granting of specific reliefs from Customs duty and income tax to persons establishing new industries in the Colony. In 1951 the Rugby Portland Cement Company Limited, in association with the Colonial Development Corporation, set up the Trinidad Cement Company Limited, with a capital of $8,000,000, to undertake the manufacture of cement. The annual output of the factory, which is likely to begin production in 1954, is expected to be 100,000 tons. During 1952 the following were declared "Pioneer Industries": Essential Oils; Suitcases and Wooden Trunks; Radio and Phonographic equipment.

Education

Primary education in the Colony is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12 resident within two miles of a Government or assisted school. No pupil is retained on the roll of a primary school after attaining the age of 15. Secondary schools prepare pupils for the Cambridge school certificate and higher school certificate examinations. On the results of the latter, five university scholarships are awarded annually by Government.

On the 31st December, 1952, there were 317 Primary Schools (64 Government and 253 Assisted), 8 Intermediate Schools (2 Government and 6 Assisted), 158 Private (Non-Assisted) Primary Schools and 13 Secondary Schools (1 Government and 12 Assisted). There were
129,007 pupils on roll in the Primary Schools, exclusive of 6,019 who were attending the Intermediate Schools. In the Secondary Schools there were 6,128 pupils on roll. In addition to the 13 Secondary Schools there were 35 Private (Non-Assisted) Schools with an enrolment of 4,067 pupils providing courses leading up to the School Certificate Examination. Thus there were 10,195 pupils receiving secondary education in Secondary Schools, apart from a not inconsiderable number in the Intermediate Schools. A Board of Industrial Training maintains a full-time technical school and conducts evening classes at seven different centres. Comprehensive in-service training in well-equipped schools and workshops is also carried out by the larger oil companies. The Department of Education conducts evening classes for adults and the Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies (situated in Jamaica) provides a programme of classes at an intermediate university level. There were over 600 students from the Colony studying at universities in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Expenditure on education (excluding school buildings) was nearly $6,000,000 in 1952 as compared with $956,000 in 1938.

Libraries

Government has in recent years substantially increased the provision made for public library services, which are accepted now as an essential corollary to the work of formal and adult education. This has enabled the beneficial effects of reading and study to be spread more widely and effectively not only in the capital city where facilities of this sort have, in some measure, existed for more than a hundred years, but has brought similar benefits to the inhabitants of a steadily increasing number of other towns, notably San Fernando, and, perhaps even more important, to a large and growing part of the rural areas of Tobago as well as Trinidad. Some indication of this expansion may be gleaned from the fact that the use and circulation of books and other reading matter in public libraries during 1952 was more than 1,200 per cent. what it used to be only 10 years ago.

Health

There are three general, a mental, a venereal diseases, a tuberculosis and eight district hospitals and a tuberculosis sanatorium, a leprosarium and two houses of refuge, with a total of 3,754 beds. In 1952 the daily average number of beds occupied was 3,318 and the total number of patients treated 45,804. Health centres and rural dispensaries are maintained in the townships and in the larger villages. A public health programme is administered through the following divisions and units: malaria, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, leprosy, yaws, hookworm, nutrition, health education, maternity and infant welfare. The ten principal causes of death were diseases in early infancy (151 per 100,000), cardiac and valvular diseases, old age, diarrhoea and enteritis, cerebral haemorrhage, pulmonary tuberculosis, cancer, broncho-pneumonia, bronchitis and nephritis (31 per 100,000).

The expenditure by the Health Department in 1952 was $6,767,000 compared with $1,000,000 in 1938.

Communications

The main airfields are at Piarco, 12 miles from Port of Spain (Trinidad) and Crown Point (Tobago). Eight airlines (British West Indian Airways, Pan American Airways, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Aerovías Brasil, Aerolineas Argentinas, Trans-Canada Airlines and St. Vincent Government Air Service) maintain scheduled operations through Piarco. British West Indian Airways Limited provides daily communication between Trinidad and Tobago. In 1952 at Piarco there were 12,505 aircraft movements, 44,000 passengers arrived and 691,000 lb. of mail and cargo were unladen. A meteorological station is maintained by the British Caribbean Meteorological Service at Piarco.

There are 118 miles of Government railway. In 1952 over 4,000,000 passengers and 356,000 tons of goods were carried. The Government railway ancillary services, which provide omnibus communication only between Port of Spain and San Fernando and adjacent feeder routes, carried 3,800,000 passengers. Transport of goods is performed by contract.

There were in 1952 2,410 miles of roads; main roads 1,092 miles, local roads 1,318 miles.

Trinidad is well served by steamship lines; these include the Alcoa, American President, American Republics, Blue Star, Booth, Canadian National, Cunard White Star, Elders and Fyffes, French, Furness, Harrison, Moore-McCormack, Norgeuf, Nourse, Royal Mail, Royal Netherlands, Surinam and Venezuelan lines. In 1952, 5,113 ships passed through with a total net tonnage of 15,165,000.

The Government coastal steamers maintain regular weekly services between Port of Spain (Trinidad) and Scarborough (Tobago).

Broadcasting

The Trinidad Broadcasting Company Limited operates "Radio Trinidad" on the following frequencies:

- 790 kc/s. (379.7 metres).
- 6,085 kc/s. (49.3 metres).
- 3,275 kc/s. (91.6 metres).

Radio Distribution (Trinidad) Limited operates a wide rediffusion service from Port of Spain to Tunapuna and in San Fernando. The service offers two programmes one of which consists of a relay of the "Radio Trinidad" transmissions.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is dependent on agriculture. Estimated numbers in the main occupations in 1951 were: agriculture, forestry and fishing 67,000; petroleum mining 11,200; manufacturing 31,600; construction 12,300; commerce 21,600; transport 11,100; Government services 25,400; personal and recreative services 20,800.

In July 1952 there were 34 workers' unions and eight unions of employers.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are sugar and by-products (molasses and rum), cocoa, coconuts and coconut products, citrus and by-products, rubber, coffee, tonka beans and bananas. Ground provisions, maize and rice are also grown for local consumption. Copra is now mostly processed locally into edible oil, coconut oil, lard compound, margarine, butter substitute and laundry soap.
The estimated livestock population in 1952 was as follows: cattle 37,900; water buffaloes 3,200; goats 32,000; sheep 4,000; swine 34,000; horses 2,200; mules 2,800; donkeys 6,000; and poultry 600,000.

The outturn of timber and fuel from the forest in 1952 was 5,258,348 cubic feet. There were 66 licensed sawmills in 1952.

There is extensive fishing in coastal waters but the catch is insufficient to meet demand. Experiments are being carried out in fishpond culture.

Crude petroleum and natural gas are produced in the southern part of Trinidad. Foreign crude oil is also imported from Venezuela, the refined products being re-exported. The (asphalt) "Pitch Lake," 109 acres in extent, is at La Brea; 170,595 tons of natural asphalt were produced in 1952.

In addition to the two main industries of oil and sugar, the island is the world's only supplier of Angostura bitters. Its manufactures also include bricks and tiles, textiles, stapled boxes, matches, cigarettes, beer, aerated waters, biscuits, chocolate, confectionery, ice, stock feed, glass, time recording clocks and equipment, bay rum, drugs, industrial gases; printing, foundry work and ship repair should also be mentioned.

The chief imports are food, beverages, tobacco, mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials, chemicals, manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment.

### Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

A statutory Marketing Board is charged with assisting and improving the marketing and processing of agricultural and fishery produce in the interests of producers and in particular with assisting co-operative societies to dispose of their produce to the best advantage. The Board also controls the export of *gros michel* bananas. The other agricultural products are marketed mainly through producer associations within the framework of agreements, e.g. the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, (Coconut) Oil and Fats Agreement, or through normal commercial channels, e.g. rum, bitters, coffee.

In 1952 there were 260 agricultural credit societies with 10,207 members and a total working capital of $1,218,160; 10 agricultural co-operative societies with 1,627 members and total assets of $879,657; 140 credit unions with 10,225 members and total assets of $451,600; and 372 friendly societies with 151,747 members and net assets of $1,734,600.
