BAHAMA ISLANDS

Area, etc.

The total area of the Colony is 4,404 square miles. It is separated on the west from Florida by the Straits of Florida and on the south from Cuba by the old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.

Population

The population in 1952 was estimated at 84,395. Except for about one-sixth, the inhabitants are of the negro race. English is universally spoken.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of an archipelago of about 700 islands, of which only 20 are inhabited, and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are generally long, narrow and low-lying and are of aeolian limestone formation. The soil, except in small pockets, is shallow and overlaid hard rock. On the whole, it is suitable only for peasant farming. Conditions are sub-tropical and both temperate and tropical trees grow literally side by side. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahaina, where there are extensive pine forests.

Climate

The winter climate is delightful. Frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70°, the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. During the summer months the greatest heat ranges from 80° to 90° and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the Colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating.

The rainfall for the year 1952 amounted to 62·70 inches compared with 42·44 inches in 1951.

Principal Town

Nassau, the capital, is the chief port and the only town of any size. It is situated on the island of New Providence, the population of which is 36,243.
History

San Salvador, one of the islands composing the Colony, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had settlements on any of the islands of the group at any time. In 1649 Parliament, on the petition of William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands" which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding an earlier Royal Grant in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles II in 1670 granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. Before the 1670 Grant the inhabitants of the islands had organized the settlement and instituted a form of government, which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected their Governor. His appointment was later confirmed by the Lords Proprietors and a regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown in 1717.

The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica. By 1703 it had reached some importance, when it was practically annihilated by the French and Spaniards. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned once more. The islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place; since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1781, but were re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux and British possession was confirmed by the Peace of Versailles, 1783. After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas group and received substantial assistance from England, and in 1787 the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

Constitution and Administration

The present constitution of the Bahamas is similar to those of the North American colonies prior to the War of Independence. The government is modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected House of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.

The constitution, much as it exists today, was finally settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. Representative, though not responsible, government exists. The executive government is in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who has the power of veto, and is advised by an Executive Council of not more than nine members. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation are vested by law in the Governor in Council.

The Legislative Council, consisting of nine members nominated by the Crown, was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841.

The House of Assembly is composed of 29 elected members; the qualification for members is possession of real or personal property to the value of £200. The qualification for electors is ownership of land to the value of £5 or the occupation of houses of annual rental value of £2 8s. in New Providence, or half that amount in the Out Islands. Women have no vote. The normal life of the House is seven years, but it may be dissolved at any time by the Governor. No forms of local government exist.

In addition to the usual government departments in New Providence there are public boards dealing with public works, education, health, piloting, agricultural and marine products, oil exploration, electrical development, telephones, prisons, industrial school, licensing (liquor and shops) and libraries, which are appointed annually by the Governor, consisting of five members, two of whom are required to be members of the House of Assembly.

In the Out Islands the commissioners administer their respective districts; annual boards of works and health under their chairmanship are appointed by the Governor.

Land Policy

The Status of Aliens Act 1950 empowers an alien to acquire and hold property within the Colony.

Taxation

There is neither income tax nor excise duty. The general Customs duty is 20% ad valorem plus 5% ad valorem emergency tax. Staple foodstuffs pay a low specific duty and no emergency tax; spirits and tobacco are taxed at higher rates than the general, and gasoline pays a specific duty with additional sales tax. Preferential margins are designed to implement the Ottawa and Anglo-American trade agreements.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 411,764    | 655,460        |
| 1948 | 1,360,226  | 1,317,621      |
| 1949 | 1,329,967  | 1,509,974      |
| 1950 | 1,579,748  | 1,658,741      |
| 1951 | 2,044,385  | 1,828,642      |
| 1952 | 2,397,097  | 2,414,256      |
| *1953| 2,539,100  | 3,005,090      |

* Approved Estimates.

The main sources of revenue are Customs dues and receipts from fees, Post Office, and public utilities. In 1952, 47.7% of the revenue was derived from import duties. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Development Board (11.4%)
- Public Utilities (13.1%)
- Medical Department (7.8%)
- Public Works (24.9%)
- Education (5.3%)

In December 1952 the authorized Public Debt was £1,046,000 (approximately £12 per head of population).
Currency

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States and Canadian currencies are also generally accepted in the Colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government through the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada. A total amount of £1,007,700 of these notes was in circulation on 31st December, 1952. Accounts are kept in sterling. There are branch banks of the Royal Bank of Canada and Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.) in Nassau.

Education

There is a government system of elementary education and attendance is compulsory from 6 to 14 years of age. In 1951 legislation was passed empowering the Board of Education to conduct a Teachers' Training College, continuation classes and a circulating library for schools. The government elementary schools were made free in 1885. Higher education is provided at Queen's College, St. Francis Xavier's Academy, the Government High School, St. Augustine's Boys School and St. John's College, all in Nassau.

Of the 177 Primary Schools 98 are Board Schools and 30 are grant-aided; the total of pupils is 18,197. There are 1,080 pupils in the seven Secondary Schools; 403 in the technical school; and 30 students in the institutions providing higher education. In 1952, 18 students from the Bahamas were taking courses in the United Kingdom, 44 in the United States and 12 in Canada.

Government expenditure on primary and technical education in 1952 was £160,022, compared with £16,802 in 1935. The latter figure is for primary education only as there was at that time no Government expenditure on technical education.

Health

The medical needs of the Colony in New Providence are met by the Bahamas General Hospital and Prospect Hospital (ex-R.A.F.) temporarily until the new General Hospital and Mental Hospital are built. There is a full-time resident staff of six doctors, Matron and eight Sisters, with 20 local nurses and 66 student nurses. The service of the Hospital is furnished largely free of charge. There is an Out-Patient Department, a General Hospital, a Mental Hospital, Infirmary, Dental, Venereal, Ophthalmic and Surgical Clinics. There are X-Ray and Bacteriological Laboratories. In 1951 in-patients numbered 5,415 and there were 13,532 out-patient attendances.

The principal diseases are tuberculosis, venereal diseases and malnutrition. Preventive measures include a Public Health Department with sanitary staff, ante-natal and child welfare clinics. Medical services in the Out Islands are maintained by a staff of four Medical Officers and 20 Nurses with dispensary-clinics.

Expenditure on Medical and Health Services for 1952 was £142,760 compared with £25,695 during 1935.

Communications

Oakes Airport is the main airfield in the Bahamas which provides 24-hours service for long range international and local airlines. In addition, there are six landing strips completed, in the various Out Islands. Scheduled international air services are operated into Nassau by B.O.A.C. from London via New York and Bermuda, and from Montego Bay, Jamaica. Pan American World Airways operate daily flights from Miami, Trans-Canada Airlines from Montreal via Tampa, Florida, Mackey Airlines from Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, and British West Indian Airways from Kingston, Havana, and Miami.

Internal air services are run by Bahamas Airways, Limited, and Bahamas Air Traders, with a fleet of amphibian aircraft giving complete out-island air service.

During the year 1952, air traffic at Oakes Airport reached unprecedented levels, 6,942 landings being recorded during the year.

The following mileage is of roads in New Providence, practically all of which may be used by motor traffic:

| Type          | Public | Private |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Asphalted     | 120-125| 9·162   |
| Macadamized   | 26·023 | 11·061  |
| Unimproved earth | 19·245 | 19·088 |

Totals .. 165·393 miles 39·311 miles

On Eleuthera there is an asphalt main road 60 miles in length covering the greater part of the Island and on Grand Bahama, 65 miles of motor road has been built. Rough but motorable main roads stretch from end to end of the islands of Exuma, Long Island and Cat Island and around San Salvador. There are no railways in the Colony.

There are regular freight services between the Colony and New York and Florida; Halifax and Montreal (Canadian National Steamship Line); and the United Kingdom (Royal Mail Line and Pacific Steam Navigation Company). The latter Line also operates a passenger service by the M.V. Reina del Pacifico.

In 1952, 144 calls by cruise ships were made at Nassau.

Ships also call at Inagua and Pine Ridge to take on salt and lumber exports.

The tonnage of all vessels entered and cleared in the Colony in 1952 was: British 1,261,051, total 2,766,363.

Broadcasting

Government owns and operates a broadcasting station located in Nassau. The power of its transmitter is 5,000 watts, frequency 1,540 kc/s, and call sign ZNS. Commercial operation began in 1950, though a broadcasting station has existed since 1936. There are 2,451 licensed receivers in Nassau and 1,124 in the Out Islands, and it is estimated that there is an average of 4·5 listeners per receiver. Government supplied and maintains 60 community receivers in school houses in the Out Islands where there may be as many as 200 listeners in the evenings. The Board of Education uses approximately 4½ hours air-time per week for broadcasting educational programmes to Out Island teachers and pupils.

Principal Occupations

The tourist traffic continues to be the main industry of the Colony and is the chief source of revenue and of dollars.

The following table shows the number and nationality of visitors during the years 1948–52.

Agricultural work in the United States provides employment for some 4,200 unskilled Bahamian labourers and their earnings in 1952 amounted to about $5,600,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are fresh vegetables, tomatoes, pineapples, citrus, bananas, avocados, and sisal.

The livestock population is (rough estimate) horses and mules 3,640, cattle 3,300, sheep 22,200, goats 14,300, swine 9,000 and poultry 400,000.

Exports of timber in 1952 totalled 4,764,000 feet, valued at £166,508.

Crawfishing and scale fishing are extensively carried out during the open season (October 1st—March 15th). The bulk of the catch is exported to the United States.

The following marine products were exported during 1952:—sponge (3 cwt.), crawfish (554 tons), scalefish (92 tons), salt (1,500,000 bshls.), turtle shell (53 cwt.).

There are four canning plants in the Colony which are engaged principally in canning tomatoes and pineapples. Straw products are manufactured as cottage industries and the raw material for this work is obtained chiefly from palm fronds and sisal fibre. Straw-work exported during the year amounted to £17,631. The majority of the canneries' output is consumed locally.

In 1938, 23·8% of total imports came from the U.K.; 18·5% from other Commonwealth countries and 57·7% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 25·5 from U.K.; 17·7 from other Commonwealth countries and 56·8 from foreign countries.

In 1938, 22·6% of exports went to the U.K.; 22·5% to other Commonwealth countries and 54·9% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 38% to U.K.; 21·3% to other Commonwealth countries and 40·7% to foreign countries.

Nearly all the Colony's requirements are imported. The chief imports are cotton, manufactures, lumber, shingles, liquors, furniture, machinery, hardware and foodstuffs of all kinds.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Bahamas Produce Exchange in Nassau handles much of the agricultural produce of the Colony. It assists the farmers in New Providence and Out Islands in disposing of their produce without glutting the market and depressing prices unnecessarily.

There are no co-operative societies in the Colony other than 28 Farmers' Associations on the Islands of Eleuthera and Cat Island. These associations are assisted by the Board of Agriculture to the extent of advancing seed and fertilizer, etc., for the tomato and other crops. The Board markets the crops and deducts their advances from the proceeds of each consignor until the entire indebtedness is liquidated.
