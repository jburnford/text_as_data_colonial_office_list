SEYCHELLES

Area
The Colony lies in the Indian Ocean 970 miles east of Zanzibar. Its area is 156½ square miles.

Population
The estimate at 31st December, 1952 was 37,129.

Geographical Features
The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over fourteen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate
In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon, and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunder storms are rare. The average annual rainfall in Victoria up to 1952 was 90·86 inches and the mean temperature was 82°.

Principal Town
Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 9,000.

History
The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May, 1794, when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Isle de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution, and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

Constitution
The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, three official members and four unofficial members, three of whom are elected members and one a nominated member of the Legislative Council.

Land Policy
All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation
The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. Residents are eligible for the following personal allowances:

- Earned income . . . ½ (max. Rs. 1,500)
- Personal (single) . . Rs. 500
- Personal (married) . . Rs. 2,000
- Child . . . Rs. 500 (max. 2,000)

Rates of tax chargeable after deduction of allowances are:

- 2½% on first Rs. 3,000 taxable income.
- 5% on next Rs. 3,000 then increasing by 2½% for each Rs. 1,000 of taxable income up to Rs. 15,000.
- Rs. 15,000–Rs. 25,000, 30%.
- Rs. 25,000–Rs. 40,000, 40%.
- All taxable income over Rs. 40,000, 50%.

Companies pay a flat rate of 30%.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1939 | 1,167,764 | 1,105,822 |
| 1948 | 2,950,528 | 3,038,787 |
| 1949 | 3,366,431 | 4,025,269 |
| 1950 | 5,025,346 | 3,240,903 |
| 1951 | 4,908,588 | 4,211,892 |
| 1952 | 4,739,139 | 5,902,142 |

In 1952 51% of revenue was derived from Customs and 49% from direct taxes. The Public Debt of Seychelles at the end of December 1952 amounted to Rs. 390,215·78 in respect of a loan from His late Majesty's Government in 1938, repayable in 30 years, to finance the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. The accumulated Sinking Fund amounts to Rs. 166,998·10.
Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling-backed and worth 1s. 6d.

Development Plans

A Development Plan for the years 1946 to 1956 is in operation for the building of new roads, schools, hospitals and clinics, housing, reforestation, and health development, towards the cost of which an allocation of £250,000 was made from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. The original ten-year plan is practically completed and further capital works are being financed from local funds.

Other Development

A fishing development scheme financed and run by the Colonial Development Corporation (Seychelles Fisheries) was wound up during 1952. The Company left a fish-drying and processing factory at St. Anne Island.

Education

Educational institutions number 41 in all, including continuation classes, teacher training, student nurses, etc. There are 2,297 boys and 2,425 girls in the Primary schools and 131 boys and 161 girls in the Secondary schools, and 20 technical apprentices. There is no higher education in the Colony. Thirteen students are studying in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Government expenditure on education in 1952 was Rs. 467,600, compared with Rs. 27,528 in 1935.

Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has almost none of the diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria is absent and filariasis and leprosy are very infrequent. Venereal disease, once a scourge in the islands, is rapidly coming under control, while efforts to reduce intestinal infestations are also being planned. Apart from these two groups of diseases there is tuberculosis which is rather more frequent than had been previously thought. It, also, is receiving attention. Typhoid fevers are very rare. Preventive medicine is gradually coming into operation in the Colony. On the curative side there is Seychelles Hospital (110 beds) which is capable of dealing with most medical, surgical and maternity cases with the assistance of a fully equipped laboratory and small X-ray plant. Apart from Seychelles Hospital there are small hospitals at Anse Royale, Mahé, Baie St. Anne, Praslin and on La Digue Island while out-patient clinics are held at Grand Anse, Praslin and at Beoliere, North Mahé. Dental facilities exist at Victoria only. Expenditure on medical and health services in 1952 was Rs. 648,269 or Rs. 17·70 per head of the population.

Communications

There are 86 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet, earth-surfaced. Tarmac surfacing is in progress in Victoria and suburbs.

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 50 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. British India Steam Navigation Company vessels on the Bombay-Mombasa service call at Seychelles monthly from Mombasa and about seven times a year from Bombay. Direct loading cargo steamers from the United Kingdom call quarterly.

Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and re-diffusion) station broadcasts nightly for one hour on a wavelength of 52 metres, 5,770 kc/s. with an output of 100/130 watts. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated number in employment in this industry is 19,800. Other occupations are:

- Domestic Service: 2,580
- Artisans: 2,340
- Public administration and the professions: 440
- Trade and Commerce: 200

There are three Trade Unions—

1. The Stevedore and Lighterage Workers' Union membership: 148
2. The Seychelles Building Union membership: 230
3. The General Workers' Union membership: 195

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are coconuts, cinnamon, patchouli and vanilla; breadfruit, bananas, cassava, yams and sweet potatoes are grown for local consumption.

In 1950 livestock numbered: cattle 2,122; pigs 2,328; goats 1,200; poultry 40,000.

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,000–1,500 tons per annum. The fishing industry is mainly confined to local needs but there is a small export of salt fish to East Africa.

Deposits of sea-bird guano are worked on the distant coral islands of the Aldabra and Farquhar groups. Some 10,000 tons of this phosphatic fertilizer are exported annually.

Copra manufacture is carried out in locally-made copra kilns. There are about 50 essential oil distilleries, mostly cottage stills. Two small coir factories produce rope and coir mattress fibre for local use. Two coconut farms produce soap from coconut oil for local use.

A coconut oil expeller, which has a crushing capacity of 200 tons of copra a year, has been installed to produce better coconut oil and stockfeed with a lower content of oil.

The chief imports are grain and flour, sugar, butter, cheese, vehicles, petroleum and cotton piece-goods.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

There are as yet no true co-operative societies in the colony. Agricultural credit is available from the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. A Copra Producers' and Shippers' Committee is responsible for the marketing of copra. The Copra Price Stabilization Ordinance, 1949, provides for a cess of 6% of the f.o.b. price of copra. These funds may be used to subsidize prices to the producer should world prices decline.
