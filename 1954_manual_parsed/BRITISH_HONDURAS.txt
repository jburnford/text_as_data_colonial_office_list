BRITISH HONDURAS

Area

British Honduras lies on the Caribbean coast of Central America, bounded on the north and part of the west by Mexico and by Guatemala in the remainder of the west and south. Its land area is about 8,866 square miles, which includes a number of islets, known as "cays", lying off the coast.

Population

The estimate at the end of 1952 was 73,171. The races are now heavily intermixed and although the 1946 Census gave the following racial figures:

- Creoles: 41,053
- American Indians (Maya): 10,030
- Caribs: 4,112
- White: 2,329
- East Indians: 1,366
- Syrians: 128
- Chinese: 50
- Race not stated: 152

A great many persons would have considerable difficulty in deciding to which group they belong.

English is the official language and the language taught in the schools. Spanish is also in common use, chiefly by the Indians—whose language it is tending to replace. The term Creole is now commonly used to denote local negroes and persons of negro extraction; it is also used in respect of persons of mixed Spanish and Indian descent. The Census figure for Creoles therefore includes pure-blooded negroes as well as Latin-Americans. These latter immigrants now form an increasing proportion of the population.

Geographical Features

The coastline is, for the most part, flat and swampy, but the country rises gradually towards the interior. The Maya Mountains and the Cockscombs, which reach a height of 3,700 feet, form the backbone of the southern half of the Colony. All of the western (Cayo) District is hilly and includes the Mountain Pine Ridge most of which lies between 1,000 and 2,000 feet above sea level but rises in parts to around 3,000 feet. The northern districts are also hilly except towards the coast but contain considerable areas of low table land. There are seventeen principal rivers, of which the Belize River is the most important. None is navigable by vessels over six feet draught and few for any notable distance. An estimated 92% of the mainland is under forest.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and on the whole agreeable to non-tropical peoples. In the capital, Belize, the temperature range during the year is 50° to 96° with an average mean of 78·5°. Most of the year the heat and humidity are tempered by sea breezes. This description applies with small variation along the whole coastal area. Inland the day temperatures, during the dry season, tend to be higher, up to 100°, but drop considerably at night. Rainfall increases from north to south:

| Annual average Inches |
|------------------------|
| Corozal (north)        | 51 |
| Belize (central)       | 63 |
| El Cayo (western central) | 52 |
| Stann Creek (upper south) | 147 |
| Toledo (south)         | 175 |

There are two dry seasons, the main one from March to May and the other in August and September (called the Maugre Season).

The Colony has been struck from time to time by hurricanes; the most disastrous in recent history struck Belize on 10th September, 1931, causing heavy loss of life and property.

Principal Towns

| Population (1946 census) |
|--------------------------|
| Belize (capital)         | 21,886 |
| Corozal                  | 2,190 |
| Orange Walk              | 1,395 |
| Cayo                     | 1,548 |
| Stann Creek              | 3,414 |
| Punta Gorda              | 1,375 |

The population of Belize is now estimated at 27,000 due to a shift from the less favoured district towns.

History

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus and its settlement is believed to have been effected about 1638, by adventurers who were attracted by the logwood which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were for a long time at St. George's Cay. The Spaniards from neighbouring settlements frequently endeavoured to expel the logcutters; but though they succeeded in driving them from the northern coast of Yucatan about 1717, they failed to dislodge them from the eastern coast.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito Coast in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers. Their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protection and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Ruatan and at Black River on the mainland. Ruatan was abandoned in 1749 but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements on the Mosquito Coast. As a result of the Treaty of Paris in 1763 the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay", the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms. By the Treaty of Versailles of 1783 Spain recognized a district (within what is now British Honduras) within which the British logcutters might work without interference; and by the Convention of London signed in 1786 it was agreed that the British colonists should evacuate the Mosquito Coast and the adjacent islands. In spite of these treaties many of the settlers remained outside the agreed limits and it was not until the treaties of 1859, with the Republic of Honduras, and 1860, with Nicaragua, that the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast were finally recognized as belonging to those states, Nicaragua agreeing to allow the Mosquito Indians autonomy in the Reserve which was assigned to them.

Constitution

Certain changes were approved in 1953. These will include universal adult suffrage; a Legislative Council composed of a Speaker (replacing the Governor as President) nine elected members,
three nominated members and three ex officio members; and an Executive Council composed of three official members and six members elected by the Legislative Council from its number, two of whom will be nominated members. The existing Constitution provides for a Legislative Council of 14 members with the Governor as President, three ex officio members, four unofficial members nominated by the Governor and six unofficial members elected by the five constituencies (two from the Belize District and one each from the other districts); and an Executive Council consisting of the Governor, three ex officio members and four nominated unofficial members.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on a graduated scale rising from 5% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 45% on all income over $25,000. Surtax is levied on the first $2,000 in excess of $8,000 of chargeable income at the rate of 10%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 15%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 20%; and on the remainder at 25%. Deductions allowed against income are a personal allowance of $600, plus allowances for wife, children, dependent relatives, life assurance premiums, earned income and gifts to charity. The rate of tax on Companies is 35% on the first $100,000 of chargeable income, 37½% on the next $100,000 and 40% on the remainder.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure | Grants-in-aid included |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1938 | 1,740,602 | 1,872,413 | —                     |
| 1948 | 3,208,623 | 3,394,916 | 100,750               |
| 1949 | 3,711,232 | 3,847,374 | 339,800               |
| 1950 | 5,360,473 | 5,415,753 | 820,000               |
| 1951 | 4,883,952 | 4,441,305 | —                     |
| 1952 | 4,921,202 | 4,907,330 | —                     |

It was estimated that in 1952 approximately 47% of the true revenue was derived from Customs duties and charges and 35% from internal taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: administration 44%, public works 20%, medical 12%, education 10%, other social development and welfare services 2%.

The Public Debt of the Colony at the end of 1952 amounted to $1,489,718 of which $282,750 was in respect of borrowings made locally. Sinking funds on hand amounted to $420,304, leaving $1,069,415 as the net outstanding debt. Of this debt over $420,200 was in respect of amounts re-loaned to municipal quasi-government bodies and government servants. During 1952 a Development Loan Ordinance (No. 21 of 1952) was passed authorizing the raising of a loan of $2,400,000 but no monies were raised thereunder. A further instalment of $45,000 was raised under the Public Officers Building Scheme Loan Ordinance of 1951.

Currency

The unit of currency is the British Honduras dollar which is exchanged at four to the £ sterling. Notes of $10, $5, $2 and $1 are issued and there is a silver coinage of 50, 25 and 10 cents, a nickel coin of 25 cents (new issue) and one of 5 cents, and a bronze 1 cent coin.

Development Plans

British Honduras received an allocation of £600,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds in 1945, followed by a further £850,000 as a result of recommendations in the Evans Report in 1949. In 1952 a further £800,000 was allocated to the Colony to finance the next stage of development, which is primarily in the field of agriculture. The Plan, which includes also loan funds of about £600,000 ($2,400,000), covers a four-year programme; and in addition to the funds voted to agriculture, substantial allocations have been made for the consolidation of internal communications, the expansion and improvement of the electricity supply in Belize, re-afforestation, and social services.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation also have a number of projects in the Colony. The Fort George Hotel, built by the Corporation, was opened for business early in 1953. It has 35 bedrooms and is designed for tourist trade.

The Citrus Company of British Honduras continues to expand the cultivation of grapefruit and oranges in the Stann Creek Valley. Exports of grapefruit are increasing. The Company is also considering opening groves in the Western District.

Education

Primary education is principally through subsidized denominational schools controlled by a Board of Education. There are two government and 91 grant-aided primary schools with an enrolment of 12,139. In addition there are 26 unaided primary schools with an average total enrolment of 1,013. There are six secondary schools, all unaided and denominational, and one government-run Technical High School which was opened in January 1952, with the aid of a Colonial Development and Welfare grant. There is no provision for education of university standard but scholarships are awarded which carry the recipients to the University College of the West Indies (Jamaica). The University College stations an Extramural Tutor in Belize.

The actual expenditure on education from general revenue during 1952 was $370,626, compared with $71,175 in 1935. In addition $16,000 a year is devoted to Listowel Boys' Training School for delinquent boys.

Health

The Colony is relatively free from endemic disease. Malaria, which is most prevalent, has shown a substantial decrease in incidence owing to the half-yearly spraying with D.D.T. undertaken with the aid of U.N.I.C.E.F. The main hospital is in Belize and there are small hospitals in each of the five districts, all run by government. Beds total 244. In 1952 there were 6,228 admissions to the six hospitals and the out-patients department of the Belize Hospital recorded 35,806 attendances. Eleven rural dispensaries in the more important villages are each in charge of a qualified rural health nurse.

Actual expenditure on health services during 1952 was $414,490, compared with $80,071 in 1935.

Communications

Stanley Field, about ten miles north-west of Belize, is the principal airport of the Colony. International air services are operated to the Colony by the following airlines:

- British West Indian Airways (B.W.I.A).
- Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (T.A.C.A. de Honduras).
- Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (T.A.C.A. International).
In addition, British Colonial Airways, based in Belize, fly a scheduled round trip to Chetumal three times a week, using small, three-passenger planes.

There is a weekly service between Jamaica and Belize and a weekly service New Orleans (U.S.A.), Belize, Guatemala City, Tegucigalpa (Republic of Honduras) and return. British Colonial Airways also operate an internal air service, on schedule to certain district towns and on charter to other parts of the Colony.

There are over 260 miles of all-weather roads in the Colony and a further 21 under construction; in addition there are 128 miles of feeder roads usable by motor traffic, six miles of cart roads passable by motor traffic during dry weather and 151 miles of government-maintained bush trails.

The only fairly regular passenger ship service is supplied by the Cayman Shipping Company which operates small vessels more or less fortnightly between Belize and Kingston, Jamaica. Cargo service is provided from the United States of America at irregular intervals by the United Fruit Company, and from the United Kingdom by T. and J. Harrison, Ltd. In 1952 a total of 500 steam and motor vessels and 746 sailing vessels, 213,125 tons in all, entered the Colony.

Broadcasting

Government operates a radio broadcasting service (B.H.B.S.) transmitting on the following frequencies and powers: 1,280 kc/s (235 metres), 500 watts; 3·3 Mc/s. (90 metres), 250 watts and 4·9 Mc/s. (60 metres), 5·5 kW. Programmes are given in English and Spanish and include both local and foreign news, announcements of local interest, transcribed music and plays. Daily time totals four hours but will increase as local talent, now being fostered, becomes available. Licensed receiving sets in the Colony totalled 1,140 at the end of 1952.

Principal Occupations

The numbers engaged in the principal occupations at the 1946 census were:

- Agriculture: 5,865
- Manufacture and Repair: 2,551
- Forestry: 2,040
- Personal Service: 1,879
- Trade and Finance: 1,716
- Public Service: 1,337

Membership of trade unions totalled 9,496, an increase of just on 3,000 over the previous year's total. There are six trade unions in the Colony, of which the largest is the General Workers' Union with a nominal membership of 8,500.

Main Crops and Products

Indian corn (maize), beans and peas, rice, cassava, and yams are the principal food crops of the Colony. The main export crops are coconuts, citrus fruits and products, bananas and maize. Pigs and poultry are raised throughout the Colony. Timber is the principal export product, mainly mahogany, pine, and cedar. Rosewood, Banak, Santa Maria and other woods are also exported. Efforts are being directed to building up the Colony's fisheries and an export trade to the United States, chiefly in lobsters, is growing.

Of industries, sawmilling is the most important (22 mills in operation at the end of 1952) and there are a cigarette factory, a soap factory, an aluminium door, window and louvre fabricating factory, and several small furniture factories operating in Belize. In different parts of the Colony there are canneries, one operating in the Stann Creek Valley on citrus products is of notable size, and in the Corozal District there is a large sugar factory.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Marketing Board is operated by Government, its principal concern is with the purchase of agricultural produce such as rice, beans and corn at guaranteed prices and the marketing of these products both locally and abroad. It also makes seasonal crop loans.

At the end of 1952 there were 22 Credit Unions, three Consumer Co-operatives, two Marketing Co-operatives, two Farmers' Co-operatives and one Housing Co-operative. In addition there were 40 junior and senior Savings Unions.
