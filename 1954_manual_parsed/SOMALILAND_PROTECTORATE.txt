**SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE**

**Area**
The Protectorate extends along part of the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden and is 68,000 square miles in area.

**Population**
No complete census has yet been possible but the mainly nomadic Somali population is estimated to be 640,000. There are a small number of Arab and Indian traders, and a few European representatives of commercial firms based on Aden.
Geographical Features

The country consists of four main features—the coastal plain, the maritime plain (both known as the Guban), the escarpment, rising in parts to 6,000 and 7,000 feet (the Golis), and a gently sloping plain or plateau to the south (the Ogo). The Haud, the empty waterless plains, the greater part of which lie to the south of the Protectorate frontier, constitute the principal pastures of the country.

Climate

Except for the intense heat of the coast and an irritating dust-laden wind during the south-west monsoon from May to September, the climate is healthy and pleasant.

The temperature varies from 70°–108° in the coastal areas, and in the highlands from occasional slight local frosts (32°) to between 80° and 99°. The rainfall varies from an average of 2 inches at Berbera on the coast, to 5 inches at Burao and 15 inches at Hargeisa.

Principal Towns

The capital is Hargeisa—population about 20,000; Burao has about 4,000, Berbera, the principal port, about 7,500. The population of these towns varies considerably at different times of the year.

History

When the Egyptian garrisons were withdrawn in 1884 a British Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somaliland coast from Zeila to Berbera. By 1887 a series of treaties guaranteeing British protection had been concluded with various Somali tribes and in the following year the limits of the British and French spheres of influence were defined. The other inland boundaries of the Protectorate were defined by agreements with Italy in 1894 and Ethiopia in 1897.

Until 1898 the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the Foreign Office and in 1905 to the Colonial Office.

From 1901 until 1920 the Government was engaged in sporadic operations against the Mullah, Mohamed Abdulla Hassan. In 1910 the Government withdrew to the coast for three years but it was not until 1920 that the Mullah’s power was finally broken.

In August 1940 Italian Forces from Ethiopia invaded and occupied the Protectorate but in March 1941 the British Forces drove out the Italians and a Military Government was established. The Protectorate remained under military administration until 1948 when the Civil Government was reconstituted.

Constitution

The constitution is based on the Somaliland Order in Council, 1929. There is no Executive or Legislative Council and the power to make Ordinances is vested in the Governor. A Protectorate Advisory Council, consisting both of elected and of selected Somali representatives of all sections of the people, was established in 1947; there is also a non-statutory Governor’s Council of official members.

Land Policy

Government recognizes, or grants, individual title to land only in the towns. Apart from a small number of old freehold and waqf* titles, land in the towns is held on lease from the Government. Outside the towns there is no alienation of land.

Taxation

The principal form of taxation is indirect, i.e. Customs import and export duties, which in the financial year 1952–53 yielded 76·8% of the total ordinary revenue. There is no direct taxation other than a house tax payable by owners or occupiers of property, which is assessed at 10% of the annual rental value of the property. In addition, a municipal sales tax, or octroi, exists on certain commodities, e.g. livestock and cereals brought for sale into specific townships.

Public Finance

It was estimated that in 1953–54 some £364,330 of the entire local revenue would be derived from Customs duties. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were estimated at:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| £       |             |
| Public Works | 339,988     |
| Social Services | 186,540    |
| Administration | 167,823     |
| Development | 152,187     |

There is no Public Debt of the Protectorate apart from the liability to repay loans-in-aid amounting to £236,000 received from the United Kingdom Government during the years 1921–34 should circumstances permit.

† Includes revenue and expenditure in respect of Currency Conversion Loan: £102,750 and £113,290 respectively in 1951–52; £113,290 and £102,750 in 1952–53.
Currency

The currency in circulation is the East African currency issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The rupee currency of India, which was legal tender until 31st October, 1951, was withdrawn in that year. The East African currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

The Protectorate received an allocation of £857,232 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts (1940 and 1945). The territory, being substantially grant-aided, cannot provide additional development funds from its own resources or by raising loans. This sum has been distributed as follows:

| Service          | Amount (£) |
|------------------|------------|
| Basic Services   | 352,802    |
| Social Services  | 196,445    |
| Productive Services | 267,620 |
| Reserve          | 40,365     |

Other Development

A Somaliland subsidiary of an American Oil Company has recently taken out an exploration licence and is at present engaged upon a geological survey.

Education

Expenditure on education in 1935–36 was £500. The estimate for 1953–54 is over £52,000. Before the war, Government’s contribution to education was confined to the payment of small grants to Koranic schools and to the provision of a few scholarships for schooling in Aden or the Sudan. There are now 44 grant-aided private or Koranic schools (1,400 pupils in 1952), 14 Elementary schools (950 pupils in 1952), two Middle or Intermediate schools (330 pupils in 1952). Twenty-seven boys are maintained in Secondary schools outside the Protectorate and eight Somalis have been sent for further education in the United Kingdom. A vocational training centre, a boarding school for girls and a trades school were opened in the course of the year. There are small kindergarten schools for European and Indian children.

Health

Expenditure on medical and health services in 1935–36 was £11,000. The estimate for 1953–54 is £93,910.

The commoner diseases are tropical ulcer, the respiratory diseases, particularly lobar pneumonia, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, eye complaints and malaria. Malaria is seasonal and its incidence from year to year varies with the rainfall: it sometimes assumes epidemic proportions but its incidence is generally low and no administrative headquarters can be classified as malarious. Preventive measures are largely directed to raising the standards of housing and environmental sanitation in the towns, and to education of the people in the avoidance of disease. Malaria control by residual spraying is being carried out on an increasing scale. Tuberculosis control measures are largely dependent on treatment of infectious cases at present, but a large scale B.C.G. vaccination scheme is receiving active consideration.

There are seven hospitals, one in each of the administrative districts, with a total capacity of 590 beds. A new Group Hospital to replace the present temporary wartime building is in course of construction in Hargeisa and will probably be opened in the first half of 1954. There are in addition 13 dispensaries. During 1952, 86,210 persons attended at the out-patient departments of the hospitals and 8,207 of these were admitted; there were 28,786 first attendances at dispensaries.

Communications

Regular air services are maintained by Aden Airways between Hargeisa, Berbera and Aden, and with East Africa. There are no internal services nor railways.

There are approximately 3,000 miles of gravel or earth roads.

An irregular weekly steamer service operates between Aden and Berbera. Other sea communications are maintained by dhow. The Brocklebank Line maintains a monthly service from the United Kingdom to Berbera during the months October to April.

Broadcasting

The Government Information Office maintains a broadcasting station known as Radio Somali, which transmits on a wavelength of 7·125 Mc/s for one and a half hours per day. Receiving sets are installed in schools and community centres throughout the Protectorate.

Principal Occupations

Government service and public works provide, in effect, the only source of local employment and numbers of Somali emigrate in search of work. The large majority of the people are nomads with camels, sheep and goats. The growing of crops, though still on a small scale, is increasing.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are millet, hides, skins, gums and guano. A rough estimate of the livestock population is: camels 1,200,000, sheep 2,355,000, goats 1,645,000. There are also some cattle and horses.

| 1952 | 2,058,503         | 924,319             |

In 1938, 23·8% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 50·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 25·3% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 29·8%, 44·4% and 25·8%.

In 1938, 75·6% of exports went to Commonwealth countries and 24·4% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 82·6% and 17·4%.
