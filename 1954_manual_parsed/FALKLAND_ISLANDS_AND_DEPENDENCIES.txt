FALKLAND ISLANDS AND DEPENDENCIES

Area
The Falkland Islands, situated in the South Atlantic, lie some 480 miles north-east of Cape Horn. The numerous islands of which they are composed cover 4,618 square miles. There are two groups of Dependencies: (a) South Georgia, 800 miles to the east of the Falklands, together with South Orkney and South Sandwich, which lie 450 miles to the south-west and south-east respectively of South Georgia; (b) South Shetland and Graham Land, the most northerly point of the former being some 500 miles south of the Falklands.

Population
On 31st December, 1952, the population, excluding Dependencies, was 2,230, there being rather more males than females. All were of European descent and most were British. The population of the Dependencies is estimated at 1,400 in the summer whaling season, with rather less than half that number during the winter.

Geographical Features
There are two large islands, the East and West Falklands, and numerous smaller islands. The coastline is deeply indented and affords several good anchorages. The surface everywhere, except in Lafonia, is hilly, the maximum height being reached in the West Falkland where Mount Adam rises to 2,315 feet. There are no large inland waters. A feature of the treeless, moorland scenery is the "stone runs," long "rivers" of angular, quartzite boulders. The island of South Georgia in the Dependencies is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, and the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea.

Climate
The islands are in the same latitude south as London is north but, apart from hours of sunshine which are almost identical, there is little similarity of climate. The islands are frequently, and in summer particularly, swept by high winds which some people from the United Kingdom find trying. The average winter and summer temperatures are a good deal lower than Kew. The climatic figures for Stanley are:

- Mean annual temperature .. 43°
- Mean annual maximum .. 70°
- Mean annual minimum .. 19°
- Mean annual wind speed .. 15 knots.
- Mean annual rainfall .. 30 inches.

The Dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

Principal Town
Stanley, the capital, population 1,320, is the only town. In the Camp, the countryside other than Stanley, the largest settlement is at Darwin where there are some 100 residents.

History
The Falklands are said to have been discovered by Davis in 1592 and were apparently visited by Hawkins in 1594. On the other hand it is claimed
by some historians that Vespucci was in the Falklands in 1502. In 1764 de Bougainville established a small Colony at Port Louis in the East Falkland. This French settlement was taken over by Spain in 1766 on the promised payment of a sum said to have amounted to £24,000. In 1765 Captain Byron took possession of the West Falkland and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. This action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the British garrison in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774.

In 1820 the Republic of Buenos Aires established a settlement in the East Falkland at Soledad (Port Louis) which was destroyed in 1831 as a reprisal for interference with American sealers by the U.S. warship Lexington.

In 1833 the occupation of the islands was resumed by the British Government. Until 1843 they were under the charge of naval officers engaged in making surveys. In 1843 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis; but the following year, in order to obtain a better anchorage, they were moved to Port William, where the settlement was named Stanley. The Colony received regular grants-in-aid from 1841 until 1880, and for a mail service until 1884–85, since which year the Colony has been self-supporting. The development of the Colony has been closely linked with the growth of the Falkland Islands Company, the largest landowner and trading company, formed in 1851.

Of the Dependencies, South Georgia and the South Sandwich group were discovered in 1775 by Captain Cook who took possession of them for Britain. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain W. Smith in 1819 and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered by a Governor aided by an Executive Council which is composed of three *ex officio* members, one appointed official, and three nominated unofficial members; and a Legislative Council composed of three *ex officio*, four elected, two nominated unofficial and two nominated official members.

There is a Town Council for Stanley.

**Land Policy**

All the land is held freehold and mostly by a very few large farms. Certain areas are Crown reserves.

**Taxation**

Direct taxation is in the form of income tax, individuals paying a graduated tax, ranging in 1952–53 from 1s. in every £ of the first £100 of taxable income to 3s. 6d. in every £ exceeding £850. Companies pay a flat rate of 3s. 6d. in the £.

In 1949 an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom for the avoidance of double taxation.

There is no general Customs tariff, import duties being confined to liquor, tobacco and matches. Export duties are levied on wool, tallow, guano, hides and skins, and whale and seal oil.

There is no Public Debt.

**Currency**

The currency is British coinage and local £5, £1 and 10s. notes which are interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development Plans**

The Colony received an allocation of £150,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year programme. In 1950 the plan was revised and it is now proposed to spend about £265,000 between 1950 and 1956. The money is to be found from the following sources:

| Source                                      | Amount (£) |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Colonial Development and Welfare Grant      | 160,000    |
| Falkland Islands Revenue                    | 105,586    |

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

| Service                          | Amount (£) |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| Basic Services                   | 110,736    |
| Social Services                  | 98,350     |
| Productive Services              | 56,500     |
Basic Services.—17% of the total will be spent on buildings and 34% on roads.

Social Services.—40% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 33% on general education.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation has built a refrigeration plant at Ajax Bay on the East Falkland. It commenced operations in 1953.

Education

In 1951 there were 341 children of school age in the Colony. There is no system of higher education and no advanced secondary education. In Stanley the Government schools cater adequately for children between the ages of five and fourteen, though a number stay until their sixteenth year and, in most subjects, reach General Certificate of Education standard. Outside Stanley, education is carried on either in settlement schools, some of which are very small, or by itinerant teachers. Attendance at school in the Camp is compulsory where there is a settlement school or where a travelling teacher calls. In 1952 a maximum of twelve teachers were employed among the 163 children outside Stanley, but, owing to the remoteness of some houses, there were still 30% of Camp children receiving no education at all.

The Colony awards up to two scholarships annually to boarding grammar schools in Dorset, tenable by children with Falkland Islands parents. Four scholars are in England at present.

The cost of education in 1951–52 was £9,675 compared with £2,877 in 1935.

Health

The principal diseases in the Colony are the common cold, naso-pharyngitis, bronchitis, gastro-enteritis and rheumatism in its chronic forms. The islands possess one General Hospital, in Stanley, where there are two dispensaries, each in charge of a medical officer. The Hospital is being enlarged and modernized by the addition of a new wing. When all alterations are completed in 1954, there will be thirty-two beds. In the Camp the Falkland Islands Company maintains a doctor at Darwin and on the West Falkland there is a Government doctor at Fox Bay. During 1952 there were 120 people admitted to hospital and there were 4,394 attendances at the out-patients' department.

Expenditure on the Medical Department excluding expenditure on the new Churchill Wing to the Hospital, was £15,730 in 1952. In 1935 the sum spent was £5,225.

Communications

Communication between the Colony and the mainland of South America is maintained by the Falkland Islands Company's vessel S.S. Fitzroy which runs a mail and passenger service at least ten times a year to Montevideo. Internal communications are maintained by sea with the Government-owned Philomel, the Fitzroy and a few small private vessels. There is also a small Government-owned air service. Travellers generally use horses when moving from one settlement to another on the mainland. South Georgia is served by vessels engaged in the whaling industry and the R.R.S. John Biscoe calls there and elsewhere in the Dependencies during the southern summer. There are no roads, except in Stanley, and no inland waterway or rail services.

Broadcasting

The Government runs a broadcasting station at Stanley operating on 49 and 87 metres with a power of 0·25 kW. and, at present experimentally, on 500 metres with a power of 0·5 kW. In 1952 there were 360 wireless licence holders in the Colony. Government also operates a re-diffusion service in Stanley which in 1952 had 261 subscribers. There is also a Government wireless station on the West Falkland to which most of the farms are linked by telephone and an inter-island radio-telephone service. The East Falkland has telephone facilities similar to those on the West.

Principal Occupations

In the Camp the main occupation is sheep-farming, though a number of men are engaged on the maintenance of the Colonial Development Corporation's refrigerator plant. In Stanley the population is employed on Government and public services, trading and shipping. The population is almost equally divided between Stanley and the Camp. Local labour is organized in the Falkland Islands Labour Federation which has a 90% membership of eligible labour.

Main Crops and Products

There is no agriculture in the Colony other than a very small acreage of oats grown for hay. Householders in Stanley and the Camp grow their own vegetables. There are no minerals and the only manufactured product is a small quantity of tallow. The principal products are wool, whale meal, whale oil, other whale products and seal oil. In 1952, 4,065,023 lb. of wool, 28,249,599 lb. of whale meal, 21,079 barrels of seal oil and 213,250 barrels of whale oil were produced.
