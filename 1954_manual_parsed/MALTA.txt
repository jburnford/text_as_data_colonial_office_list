MALTA

Area

The total area is 122 square miles made up of the three main islands as follows: Malta 94·876 square miles, Gozo 25·899 square miles and Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are mere islets.

Population

On 30th June, 1952, the population, which is European, was estimated at 314,907, divided as follows: Malta 286,566, Gozo and Comino 28,341. The islands are over-populated, hence the policy of the Administration to encourage and assist emigration. During 1952 a total of 4,333 emigrants left the islands to settle overseas, principally in Australia.

Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side, which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul’s Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1952 was 41·9° recorded on the 21st January, while the highest, 97°, occurred on the 8th July. The mean annual temperature is 66° and the mean annual rainfall is 17 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the scirocco wind which blows from the south-east.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12th July, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War, and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

Constitution

Letters Patent granting self-government to the Island came into force in 1947. They provide for a Legislative Assembly of forty members, elected by universal suffrage by proportional representation. The Legislative Assembly passes Bills for “the peace, order and good government of Malta”, subject to certain limitations regarding “reserved matters”. The Ministry consists of
the Prime Minister and not more than seven other Ministers. The Executive Council consists of the Cabinet presided over by the Governor. Legislative and administrative powers in regard to defence and various matters related or incidental to defence and external relations, are reserved to the Governor, advised by the Nominated Council, which consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legal Secretary and three officers (one from each of the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force). The Privy Council consists of the Executive Council and the Nominated Council sitting together, and affords an opportunity for joint consultation in matters in which action proposed to be taken by one side of the dyarchy may affect the other side.

The English language and the Maltese language are the official languages of Malta.

Land Policy

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese, but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

Taxation

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, entertainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties, and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £200.
- 3s. for every pound of the next £300.
- 4s. 6d. for every pound of the next £400.
- 6s. 6d. for every pound of the remainder.

The tax on companies is at the rate of 5s. on every pound of the chargeable income.

A surtax is also levied on incomes exceeding £2,500 at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £500.
- 2s. 6d. for every pound of the next £500.
- 3s. for every pound of the next £500.
- 3s. 6d. for every pound of the remainder.

Personal deductions:

| Single persons | £240 |
|---------------|------|
| Husband and wife | £420 |
| Children | 80 per child |

There are also deductions for dependants and allowances in respect of contributions to pensions funds, insurance policies, etc.

Public Finance

(a) Includes a grant by His late Majesty's Government for commodity subsidies, £300,000.
(b) Includes a grant-in-aid by Her Majesty's Government of £475,000.

In 1952–53 the main items of revenue were:

| Item | Per cent. |
|------|-----------|
| Customs and Excise | 40·8 |
| Licences, taxes, etc. | 11·0 |
| Sale of water and electric current | 7·8 |
| Lotteries | 7·1 |
| Note security fund | 3·6 |

During the same year, the following were the main heads of expenditure:

| Service | Per cent. |
|---------|----------|
| Medical and Health and Social Services | 23·8 |
| Food Subsidies | 17·0 |
| Police | 4·9 |
| Pensions | 3·7 |
| Public Works and Reconstruction | 14·4 |
| Education | 8·9 |
| Agriculture | 1·7 |
| Emigration | 1·6 |

Interest at 2½% is paid by the Government on £79,081 outstanding balance on 31st March, 1953, of the debt known as "Massa Frumentaria," incurred by the Municipality of Valletta under the Government of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, in connexion with the monopoly of the wheat trade. The funds of the "Massa Frumentaria" were in 1798 appropriated by the French Government then in occupation of the Island.

By the Temporary Borrowing Act, 1951, the Government was enabled to borrow an amount up to a maximum of £500,000 by way of an overdraft on the Public Account in order to meet the cost of consignments of wheat and other essential commodities imported by the Government. The Act, which provided for the repayment of any sum borrowed not later than 31st March, 1953, has now lapsed.

Under the Malta Treasury Bills Act, 1952, the Government may, whenever authorized by Resolution of the Legislative Assembly, raise money not exceeding the amount specified in such Resolution by means of three months' Treasury Bills. On 23rd September, 1953, the amount so raised was £350,000.

Currency

The currency of Malta consists of notes of 20s. and 10s., issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, together with British coins, including silver, cupro-nickel and bronze coins, and local notes in denominations of 5s., 2s. 6d., 2s. and 1s. Bank of England notes ceased to be legal tender in the Island in 1949. Maltese £1 and 10s. notes are on a par with sterling, and £ for £ coverage is maintained at the Bank of England. The amount of local currency in circulation on 31st March, 1953, was £16,702,882 10s. 0d.

Development Plans

Free grants totalling £361,554 have been received under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 for various schemes connected with the development of the water resources.

A new underground electric power station of a capacity of 15,000 kW, built out of a grant of £2,302,000 made available to the Island by the Economic Co-operation Administration, has now been completed. It will come progressively into service as the necessary alterations in the transmission lines can be made. The station will generate current of the standard 50 cycle three phase type. The current at present in use is 100 cycle single phase.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation does not operate in the Island. There are no known mineral resources in Malta and raw materials have nearly all to be imported. The Government grants monopolies for from 5 to 15 years to help the setting up of industrial undertakings.
Education

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Elementary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 113 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction, with an enrolment of 40,754 pupils, and six Secondary schools (one of them preparatory) with 2,562 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded in 1769, has an average attendance of 300 students and grants degrees in divinity, law, medicine, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts and science. The number of Maltese studying or attending post-graduate courses in United Kingdom Universities or colleges during 1952 was five. There are 26 evening classes for languages and commercial subjects with an attendance of 648, and 95 literacy classes for illiterates and semi-Illiterates with an attendance of 1,221. Two technical schools and one tailoring school cater for 358 students, while 240 pupils attend 23 evening classes for handicraft. Forty-seven trade classes for emigrants have an attendance of 661 pupils. There are two Government orphanages with a total of 173 inmates. The total number of private (elementary and secondary) schools is 73, with an attendance of about 13,928 pupils. In 1952–53 the amount spent on Education was £645,981 compared with £149,521 in 1935.

Health

There are eight hospitals in Malta with a total of 2,563 beds, and six in Gozo, with 494 beds. During 1951 in-patients numbered 11,648, out-patients 16,712. There are in addition 40 District Medical Officers, 38 Health Visitors (district nurses) and three subsidized Midwives. In the village dispensaries the number of attendances by the public in 1951 was 92,906.

The principal diseases during 1951 were:

| Disease               | No. of Cases | Deaths |

| Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis | 43 |        |
| Pulmonary Tuberculosis | 171         | 68     |

Vaccination of all infants against smallpox is compulsory on attaining the age of two months.

During 1952–53 the amount spent by the Medical and Health Department was £1,185,272, as compared with £202,268, in 1935.

Communications

The commercial airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station, but there are other airfields at Hal Far and Ta Qali. British European Airways operate the following services:—(a) a daily service to and from the Island to the United Kingdom, stopping at Rome and Nice; (b) a twice-weekly service to Sicily (Catania); (c) a service to Tripoli, Benghazi and Cairo twice a week. In addition the Italian Air Line Alitalia operates a service to Tripoli and Rome, three times a week. During 1952, 3,947 aircraft, of a total tonnage of 78,134, off-loaded 35,687 passengers while 3,940 aircraft, of a total of 77,984 tons, took off 35,363 passengers; 68,384 passengers passed through Malta in transit.

The size of the Island does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Five miles of road have so far been surfaced with sheet asphalt and 237 miles with full grouting, semi-grouting and surface asphalt dressing.

The chief port is the Grand Harbour, which in 1951 handled 1,680 steamships of a total tonnage of 2,059,655 and 296 sailing vessels of an aggregate total of 21,564 tons. There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. A twice-weekly service to Syracuse is operated by the Star of Malta, a locally registered vessel. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a service calling at Naples, Messina, Catania, Syracuse, Malta, Tripoli, every five days. A ferry service running between Marfa and Mgarr links the two Islands of Malta and Gozo.

Broadcasting

There are no broadcasting stations in Malta. The number of wireless receiving sets on 30th June, 1953, was, however, 12,003. Messrs. Broadcast Relay Service (Malta) Limited operate a rediffusion station situated at Hamrun. The number of rediffusion subscribers is 30,980.

The marketing of agricultural produce is controlled by the Government Department of Agriculture. Vegetables and fruits are sold at six marketing centres through farmers' co-operative societies and "Pitkali". The former charge a commission of 8½%, the latter 10%, of which 3½% is passed to the Government to meet the expenses in connexion with marketing control. The sales during 1951 amounted to £499,213.
