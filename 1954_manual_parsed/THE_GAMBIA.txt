**THE GAMBIA**

**Area**

The total area is 4,003 square miles (Colony 29 square miles, Protectorate 3,974 square miles). St. Mary's Island, with an area of about 2,500 acres of dry land, is included in the Colony area.

**Population**

The total population is estimated at 277,457, composed as follows:

- Colony—Bathurst (1951 Census) 19,602; Kombo St. Mary (1951 Census) 7,695; Protectorate (1952 estimate) 250,160. The population of Bathurst is African except for a few hundred Europeans, Syrians and Lebanese. The main tribal groups in the Protectorate are:
  - Mandingo 109,250
  - Fula (all tribal subdivisions) 55,109
  - Wolof 33,495
  - Jola 19,138
  - Serahuli 18,406
  - Others 14,762

**Geographical Features**

The River Gambia, some 700 miles in length, flows into the Atlantic by a wide estuary which narrows to two and a half miles between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 13 feet can at present proceed without trouble to Kuntaur 150 miles up-river. There is no bar to the River Gambia. The Colony consists mainly of the Island of St. Mary, at the mouth of the River Gambia, the adjoining division of Kombo St. Mary and MacCarthy Island in the middle river. The Protectorate consists of strips of territory on either bank of the river, for most of their length no more than seven miles wide.

**Climate**

The Gambia has a long dry season from November to May, which is pleasant and generally healthy. Rainfall is confined to the period from June to October and averages about 40 inches. All the year round the climate on the coast is the best in British West Africa. During the rains, however, humidity increases and, owing to proximity to the river and sea, may be higher than the rainfall would suggest. During the dry season harmattan winds from the Sahara noticeably depress both humidity and temperature. The climate up-river is much hotter, especially during the period February to June; after which the rains produce cooler and more pleasant conditions.

| Temperature and Rainfall, 1952 |
|-----------------------------|
| Height above sea or river level | Mean Temperature | Rainfall in inches |
| Bathurst 7 feet | Max. 88° 2° | 46·38 |
| | Min. 71° 4° |
| Georgetown 4 feet | Max. 93° 9° | 50·88 |
| | Min. 68° 3° |

The principal towns are—

**Colony**

Bathurst—capital—population 19,602.

**Protectorate**

Western Division—Brikama.
Central Division—Mansa Konko.
MacCarthy Island Division—Georgetown.
Upper River Division—Basse.

Population in the Protectorate is evenly distributed and there are no towns of over 3,000 inhabitants.

**History**

The Gambia was discovered by the Portuguese in 1455 but they made no lasting settlement. Between 1588 and 1752 Royal Charters were granted to various English merchants to trade with it. French merchants also pried during that period but the right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the North Bank of the river. From 1807 to 1816 the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off, in part due to the abolition of the slave trade. In 1816 a new settlement was founded on the Island of Banjul by English merchants from Senegal. Banjul was renamed St. Mary's and its town named after Lord Bathurst the then Secretary of State.

The settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone and was annexed to that Colony by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a Military Commandant, aided by a board of merchants called "The Settlement Court" administered the Government. From 1822 to 1829 the Commandant governed alone.

In December 1829, the Secretary of State appointed the first Lieutenant Governor "of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia". The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

The Gambia in the year 1843 was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs.
By the charter of 1866 it became a portion of the West African Settlements and continued to be so under the charter of 1874 until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various cessions of 1840, 1850 and 1853. In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection. Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The Protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894 and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the Government of the whole Protectorate, which is now divided into four Divisions and again into Districts. This ordinance has since been superseded by the Protectorate Ordinance, 1935. There is a Commissioner in charge of each Division and each District is under a District Head Chief.

**Constitution**

The Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary as an *ex officio* member and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed; since the Council was reconstituted in November 1951, the appointed members include five officials and four unofficials of whom one is nominated from the Protectorate. The Governor is the President of the Council and he may, on any special occasion when he desires the opinion of any person within the Colony, summon such person as an Extraordinary Member.

Under the Gambia (Legislative Council) Order in Council, as amended to 29th June 1951, the Legislative Council consists of the Governor as President, a Vice-President, who is an unofficial member, three *ex officio* members (the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), four nominated official members, five nominated unofficial members—four representing the Protectorate and one representing Trade and Commerce—two elected members representing the town of Bathurst and one elected member representing the Kombo St. Mary Division. There is thus an unofficial majority on the newly constituted Council as there was on the Council which was dissolved in 1951.

The Gambia Protectorate Order in Council, 1946, provides that the Executive Council for the Colony shall also be the Executive Council for the Protectorate.

As a result of recommendations made by a Consultative Committee, proposals for revising the Constitution were submitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and have received his approval. It is hoped to introduce the new Constitution during 1954 and it will give an unofficial majority on Executive Council and greater unofficial representation in Legislative Council.

**Land Policy**

Individual ownership of land is recognized in the Colony and there is no restriction on the acquisition of land by non-natives. Freehold interests in Crown lands are not disposed of except in special circumstances and with the sanction of the Secretary of State. A grant of Crown lands for a term of years may be made by the Governor. The normal term is 21 years with an option of renewal for a like term.

Land in the Protectorate is held on native customary tenure from the Native Authority for the district in which it is vested. In general, land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 21 years. Leases of small plots suitable for commercial or industrial purposes may be obtained from the Native Authority for the district, with the approval of the Governor. The power to approve is delegated to the Senior Commissioner.

**Taxation**

There is a sliding scale of personal income tax which amounts to the following rates on chargeable incomes (incomes of single persons up to £200 a year and married persons up to £350 a year are free of tax, and there are additional allowances for dependants):

| Chargeable income | Average rate of tax in the £ |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| £400              | 9                             |
| £600              | 1 2                           |
| £1,000            | 2 1                           |
| £2,000            | 3 6½                          |
| £5,000            | 7 5                           |
| £10,000           | 10 0                          |

The Company rate is 10s. 3d. in the £. There is no estate duty.

There is a direct tax on inhabitants of the Protectorate known as the District Rate which accrues to the District Treasuries. The rate at present is 30s. per "yard" of not more than four houses. There are additional rates for lodgers in the "yard" and "strange farmers".

The other main form of taxation is the Customs tariff.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 166,794    | 263,199         |
| 1948 | 866,900    | 1,014,097       |
| 1949 | 964,155    | 1,170,190       |
| 1950 | 999,217    | 1,062,312       |
| 1951 | 1,144,825  | 1,171,028       |
| 1952 | 1,431,495  | 1,424,213       |
| 1953 | 1,327,190  | 1,448,308 (a)   |

(a) Approved Estimates.

It was estimated that in 1953 the main heads of revenue would be:

Customs £603,250, Direct Taxation £193,000 and Colonial Development and Welfare Act and other Grants £321,260.

In the same year the estimated main heads of expenditure were:

Departmental Services £890,116, Development £354,263, Public Works £168,694.

The Public Debt of the Gambia at the end of December 1951 amounted to £38,759 13s. 9d., approximately 2s. 10d. per head of population (Gambia 3% Stock 1963). The Sinking Fund as at 31st December, 1952, amounted to £19,447.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 1d., ½d. and tenth-penny. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.
During 1952 a new type of 1d. and ½d. bronze coin was introduced and is now in circulation with the nickel coins which it will gradually replace.

Development Plans

A total of £1,300,000 was originally made available under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. Of this sum £800,000 was for services (medical, agricultural, veterinary and educational) including capital expenditure on buildings and plant. £300,000 was for the development of Bathurst and the Kombo. An additional allocation of £200,000 was promised in 1951 to augment the balance available for a reclamation scheme.

The major capital works which will remain as monuments of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act are:

(i) A new hospital in Bathurst.
(ii) A new town drainage system.
(iii) 400 acres of adjacent reclaimed land which was formerly swamp.
(iv) A new urban water supply.
(v) New schools.
(vi) New health centres and rural dispensaries.
(vii) New veterinary headquarters.

Other Development

A "Farmers' Fund" has been established from the profits of the Oilseeds Marketing Board. Besides meeting all the expenses of employing six Development Officers, it has enabled a number of schemes, chiefly of an agricultural nature, to be started. These schemes include expenditure in the opening up of new rice lands, fishing, poultry, tsetse control, communal gardens, group farming, introduction of timber-sawing by hand, and animal pest (baboon, monkey and pig) control.

A large separate scheme is an experimental farm on part of the old Colonial Development Corporation Poultry Farm. This is financed partly by the Colonial Development Corporation and partly by the Fund; it is under Government control. The Colonial Development and Welfare Rice Project in the middle river area was formally abandoned by the Corporation on 1st April, 1953, but is being carried on on an experimental basis by the Gambia Government with the help of Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. It is now in the form of a "pilot" scheme with a limited area of 245 acres under cultivation in 1953 but with plans for gradual expansion to 800 acres in 1956.

Education

Government is responsible for primary education in Bathurst; the schools have a religious grouping and are administered through Management Committees on each of which the appropriate religious authority is represented. These Government schools are eight in number and grouped thus:

one each—Anglican/Methodist Boys', Girls' and Infants' School;
one each—Roman Catholic Boys', Girls' and Infants' School;
one each—Mohammedan Boys' and Infants' School.

There are also a Government school for over age pupils and a grant-aided Mission school; the total number of children enrolled is 2,549. There is also a Domestic Science Centre for girls and an Arts and Crafts Centre for boys. Government schools have been opened at Bakau and Serekunda in the Colony; the rolls total 378 and there is a Mission school with a roll of about 200. There are four secondary Mission schools in Bathurst, two for boys and two for girls. The total number of pupils on the rolls of these schools, which are controlled by the Missions concerned but receive substantial grants from Government, is 286 boys and 172 girls.

The Methodist Girls' High School runs private kindergarten and preparatory departments attended by 148 children.

In the Protectorate there is a Government boarding school at Georgetown, the Armitage School, which gives secondary modern education up to Form V. Twenty-four Village schools have been opened by District Authorities. They are staffed by Government teachers seconded to the Authorities.

The Missions run five primary schools in the Upper River Division, and two in MacCarthy Island Division. One of the schools in MacCarthy Island Division is run jointly with the District Authority.

There is a Teacher-training College at Yundum with 22 students. Ten Gambians with Government scholarships and about 35 private students are in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on education was £58,831 in 1952 compared with £5,038 in 1935.

Health

The most common diseases are malaria, trypanosomiasis, ascariasis, yaws, bronchitis, leprosy and eye infections. The Health Services include special mosquito control units in Bathurst, Cape St. Mary and at Yundum Airport. Sanitary Inspectors are posted to important points in the Colony and Protectorate. The Health Services are also responsible for the administration of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Bathurst for the treatment of cases of communicable disease.

Medical facilities in the Gambia are based on two general Hospitals, one at Bathurst and one at Bansang. The Victoria Hospital, Bathurst, serves the town and surrounding area, is equipped to deal with general medical and surgical cases, and has an obstetrical unit and an out-patients' department. Bansang Hospital in MacCarthy Island Division of the Protectorate caters for general medical and surgical cases, has a few beds for obstetrical cases, and an out-patients' department. In 1952 4,505 in-patients and 63,802 out-patients were treated.

There are Health Centres at Basse, Georgetown, Kuntaur, Brikama, Bakau and Mansa Konko and 38 Dispensaries and sub-dispensaries situated throughout the Protectorate. Total attendances in 1952 were 268,044.

Maternity and child welfare remains chiefly centred in Bathurst, but there are twelve such clinics, three in the Island of St. Mary, five in Western Division, three in MacCarthy Island Division and one in Upper River Division. Total attendances in 1952 were 60,290.

Government expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1951 was £80,502 compared with £32,315 in 1935.

Communications

The aerodrome at Yundum, 17 miles from Bathurst, is controlled by the Government and operated on behalf of the Ministry of Civil Aviation by International Aeradio Limited. The
Public Works Department maintains runways, buildings, power and water supplies and the meteorological services are operated by the West African Meteorological Service. The West African Airways Corporation service between Accra and Dakar calls twice a week on its northerly and southerly flights.

There are 37 miles of tar macadam roads, 51 miles of laterite gravel all-season roads and approximately 667 miles of earth roads open to motor traffic during the dry season. There are also approximately 300 miles of Native Authority roads, many of which are little more than tracks but motorable in the dry season. Bituminous main roads are under construction and paving of the streets in Bathurst is in progress.

The chief port is Bathurst, which handled 115,503 tons of cargo in 1952. Services for passengers and cargo are provided by the Elder Dempster Lines and Palm Line and occasionally by John Holt and Company. The H.M.C.S. Lady Wright and the H.M.C.S. Fulladu maintain a weekly service between the main river ports from Bathurst to Fattoto, a distance of about 288 miles up the Gambia River. The two vessels carried in 1952 a total of 9,653 passengers and approximately 2,874-5 tons of cargo. The H.M.C.S. Lady Wright was out of commission for the greater part of the year.

There are no railways.

Broadcasting

There is no broadcasting or rediffusion station in the Gambia. Domestic radio receivers operate without restriction.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated numbers in other occupations in 1952 were:

| Occupation          | Number |
|---------------------|--------|
| Government Service  | 3,050  |
| Building            | 105    |
| Distributive Trades | 1,360  |
| Transport           | 200    |
| Shipping            | 350    |
| Others              | 380    |

There are three registered Trade Unions—Bathurst Trade Union, Gambia Labour Union and Gambia River Trade and Commercial Workers’ Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are groundnuts, for export and oil production, rice, sorghums and millet; some maize and a little cotton for village weaving are also grown. In 1952 57,422 tons of ground-nuts were produced.

The livestock population is: cattle 122,477; sheep 50,527; goats 75,468; pigs 2,614; horses 209; donkeys 4,307; poultry 227,129.

A fair amount of fish is caught in coastal waters and some in the lower river; very little, however, is done further up-river, though fish are fairly plentiful.

Trade

In 1938, 45·8% of the total imports came from the United Kingdom; 19·4% from other Commonwealth countries and 34·8% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were: United Kingdom 52·16%, other Commonwealth countries 15·19% and foreign countries 32·65%.

In 1938, 24·3% of all exports went to the United Kingdom, 2·3% to other Commonwealth countries and 73·4% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were: United Kingdom 94·59%, other Commonwealth countries 1·3% and foreign countries 4·11%.

Climate

The climate is mild and temperate; snow or frost is extremely rare. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in winter are 45° and 65° respectively. In summer a warm breeze laden with moisture, known as the "Levanter", strikes the eastern face of the Rock, condenses in the sky above and causes a cloud pall to hang over the city and bay. During this period the climate is humid and relaxing. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in summer are 55° and 85° respectively. The rainy season is spread over the period September to May; the average annual rainfall is 35 inches.

History

Gibraltar was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain. It was held alternately by Moors and Spaniards until 1704 when, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke and ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

Constitution

The Gibraltar (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, three ex officio members, two nominated members appointed by the Governor and five elected members. The ex officio members are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary. The Order in Council empowers the Governor to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony with the advice and consent of the Council. The Governor possesses the usual reserve of power to pass into law any measure necessary or expedient in his opinion in the interests of public order, public faith or good government (including defence). The Gibraltar Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions provide that the Governor shall be advised in the exercise of his powers by an Executive Council consisting of four ex officio members and three unofficial members. The ex officio members are the Deputy Fortress Commander, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

Taxation

This is mainly indirect. An Income Tax Ordinance was enacted in April 1952 and came into force on the 1st April 1953. There are no excise duties.

The main heads of taxation in 1952 were:

Customs.
Estate Duties.
Stamp Duties.
Licences.
Trades Tax.
Fuel Oil Tax.
Coffee Tax.

The items subject to import duty are alcoholic beverages, perfumed spirits, motor spirits, tobacco and coffee.

The Government lottery yielded £92,166.
