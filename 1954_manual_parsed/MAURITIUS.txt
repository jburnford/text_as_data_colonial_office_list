MAURITIUS

Area

The area of Mauritius is approximately 720 square miles, that of Rodrigues 40 square miles and the area of the Lesser Dependencies, viz., the Chagos Archipelago (the largest islet is Diego Garcia), Agalega and the Cargados Carajos or St. Brandon Isles, approximately 47½ square miles.

Population

The population is: Mauritius 501,000; Rodrigues 14,000; and Lesser Dependencies 1,100. It is divided into three groups: (1) General population (29·5%) comprising Europeans and descendants of Europeans and people of African and mixed origin; (2) Indo-Mauritian population proper (67%) made up of immigrants from India and their unmixed descendants; and (3) Chinese population (3·5%) consisting of immigrants from China and their unmixed descendants.

Geographical Features

The island lies in the Indian Ocean, 550 miles east of Madagascar. It is chiefly of volcanic formation but almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains, the principal peaks reaching about 2,700 feet. There are numerous rivers and streams; none of them is navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. The land rises gradually from the coasts, and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet.

Climate

The south-east trade winds blow during most of the year and the climate is generally humid. The coastal regions are quite warm in summer but the central plateau is comparatively cool all the year round. Rainfall increases from an annual average of about 50 inches at or near sea level, to nearly 200 inches on the highest part of the plateau. There is no real distinction between dry and wet seasons. Tropical cyclones usually occur between November and May and the period of most frequent activity is from January to March. Mauritius is only slightly affected by these destructive storms in most years, but on the average the effect is considerable once in four years and serious once in ten years.

History

Mauritius was probably first visited by Arab sailors and by Malays during the Middle Ages. During the early sixteenth century Portuguese sailors visited the island several times and the first European to discover it is believed to have been Domingos Fernandez. The Portuguese used it merely as a port of call without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch who landed in 1598 and gave the island the name of Mauritius in honour of their ruler, Prince Maurice of Nassau. The settlement never developed and the island was abandoned in 1710. In 1715, the island was formally taken possession of by the French. A small first contingent of colonists was sent in 1721 from the neighbouring island of Reunion (then called Bourbon), but it was not actually occupied till 1722 when a small party of colonists were sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The Island was then named Isle de France. From 1722 till about 1767 it was governed by that Company. From 1767 to 1810, apart from the brief period of independence under the Colonial Assembly during the French Revolution, it was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government.

During the long war between England and France, French men-of-war and privateers based on the Isle de France were a source of great mischief to the English merchant vessels. The British Government decided to capture the island and in 1810 a strong British expedition was eventually successful. The former name of Mauritius was then restored to it, and, with its dependencies, including Rodrigues, it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Constitution

The Government is vested in a Governor with an Executive and a Legislative Council. In accordance with Letters Patent, Royal Instructions and Order in Council dated the 9th December, 1947, the Legislative Council is composed of three ex officio, 12 nominated unofficial, and 19 elected members, under the Presidency of the Governor. The Executive Council consists of three officials (the Colonial Secretary, the Financial Secretary and the Procureur-General) and four members selected by the Legislative Council from amongst the non-official members. The Royal Instructions provide for the appointment of other members to Executive Council and, in September 1953, one elected member and one nominated member to serve on the Council were appointed. The tenure of office of appointed members is three years.

Under the new constitution, a British subject, male or female, of 21 years of age or upwards, who has been ordinarily and bona fide resident in the Colony for a period of two years preceding an election, and

(a) can pass a simple literacy test; or

(b) has an armed forces qualification; or

(c) has a business premises qualification;

is entitled to vote, unless debarred under the specific disqualifications listed in section 17 of the Order in Council.

Land Policy

Roughly one-sixth of the area of the island is owned by the Crown and consists of (a) Crown lands proper made up of unconceded lands and lands re-acquired by the Crown, and (b) "Pas Geometriques" being reserved land lying on the sea coast between the high water mark in spring tides and a line drawn parallel to the general contour of the coast at a distance of 81·21 metres. Alienable Crown lands may be sold only by public auction, except in the case of lands required for religious, charitable or educational purposes, or for public utility, when a nominal price is charged. The deeds of sale do not alienate the right of the Crown in respect of any mines of precious stones or metals or any layer of mineral oil or the right of the Crown of entering the property for the purpose of mining or of boring and collecting mineral oil, but no other restrictive clause is inserted in the deed of conveyance. Crown lands ("Pas Geometriques" excluded) may be leased by private contract or public auction. Portions of "Pas Geometriques" not exceeding two hectares may be leased by private contract after publication of notices. In the case of portions exceeding two hectares, the lease must be by public auction.

The remaining five-sixths are privately owned lands of which the holders are free to dispose as they think fit.

Taxation

Income tax rates for individuals are:

| Chargeable Income | Rate of tax cents |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| For every rupee of the first Rs. 5,000 | 10                |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 5,000 | 15                |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 5,000 | 25                |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 10,000 | 40                |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 25,000 | 50                |
| For every rupee of the next Rs. 50,000 | 60                |
| For every rupee of the remainder of the chargeable income | 75                |

In ascertaining the chargeable income a number of deductions are allowed.

Company tax is at the rate of 40%.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariff and excise duties.

Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of Rs. 1,000 (legal tender between banks and Government only), Rs. 10, Rs. 5 and Re. 1; cupro-nickel coins of Re. 1, 50 cents, 25 cents and 10 cents and bronze coins of 5 cents, 2 cents, and 1 cent. The fixed rate of exchange is 1s. 6d. to the rupee.

Development Plans

The Mauritius Development and Welfare Ten-Year Plan provides for a total expenditure of Rs. 108,898,395 (£8,167,380) to be financed from the following sources:

I. Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945:

(a) Colony's allocation | Rs. £
(b) Central allocation | 23,333,300 1,750,000
(c) Research | 385,000 28,875
II. Local Funds | 2,266,000 169,950
III. Loan Funds | 22,413,595 1,681,020
| 60,500,000 4,537,500

This total is to be spent as follows:

Social Services 26% (Health, Education, Housing Loans).
Basic Services 24% (Roads, Water Supplies, Sewerage).
Economic 37% (Agriculture, Irrigation and Hydro-electricity, Forestry, Fisheries, Secondary Industries).
Other 13% (Administration, Research, Reserve).

Since 1946 costs of materials and labour have increased appreciably and a review of the Plan has accordingly been begun.

Other Development

Mauritius depends entirely on the production of sugar. The possibilities of setting up new industries which would make use of the by-products of sugar are being studied. The production of cement is also under consideration.

Education

There are 279 educational establishments in Mauritius. Of this total, 230 are Primary schools, 48 Secondary and one post-Secondary, with a total of 78,597 pupils. The Government institutions comprise 69 Primary schools, three Secondary schools, one training college for teachers and a College of Agriculture. Nine Secondary and 76 Primary schools within the total given above are State-aided. There are also a number of private day and evening schools teaching such subjects as the Koran, Urdu and Hindi. The development of technical education is under review; at present it is limited to a number of apprenticeships in the Railway Department. The Government awarded 16 scholarships in 1952 for higher education overseas. Mauritians in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Universities numbered 208, of whom 68 were scholarship holders.

A start has also been made on adult education with the launching of public lectures, continuation and science extension classes and on school broadcasts of English and music to primary schools.

In the financial year 1951–52, expenditure on education was Rs. 5,576,999 excluding Rs. 240,732 from Imperial sources. In 1935 expenditure was Rs. 1,347,201.

Libraries and Museums

The Natural History Museum, Port Louis, and the Naval Historical Museum, Mahebourg, are both run by the Mauritius Institute. A small art gallery is also annexed to the Port Louis Museum.

There are six Libraries:

(i) Police Library, Port Louis,
(ii) Municipality of Port Louis Library,
(iii) Town Council of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill Library,
(iv) Carnegie Library, Curepipe,
(v) Mauritius Institute Library, Port Louis,
(vi) British Council Library, Rose Hill.

Health

The continuation of the Malaria Eradication Scheme has resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the disease from Mauritius. In 1952 the main causes of morbidity were influenza, anaemias, diseases due to helminths, and accidents.

The health inspectorate works from health offices of which there are 13 throughout the island. The total number of beds available in 1952 was 1,191 in general hospitals, 693 at the Mental Hospital, 230 at the Orthopaedic Centre and 62 at the Leper Asylum. In addition, 33 sugar estates provided each a small hospital with a total bed strength of 738 for the sole benefit of their employees. There were also five private nursing
homes with 53 beds. There were 45 static dispensaries, four mobile dispensaries and one mobile dental clinic. The Maternal and Infant Welfare Service provides ten static centres and one mobile ante-natal clinic. Admissions to hospitals numbered 31,206; attendances at dispensaries 516,511.

The expenditure on medical services amounted to Rs. 9,076,134 during the financial year 1952-53, compared with Rs. 1,964,369 in 1929-30.

Communications

The airport (Plaisance) is run by the Colonial Government and the meteorological services are under the control of the Director, Royal Alfred Observatory. Air France operates a scheduled "Constellation" service three times a week between Paris and Mauritius through Cairo, Nairobi, Madagascar and Reunion. Qantas Empire Airways operate a scheduled service between Sydney and Johannesburg via Melbourne, Perth, Cocos Islands and Mauritius. No internal services exist.

The railway carried 2,088,085 passengers and 496,829 tons of freight in 1951-52. Track mileage totalled 92.

There are 706 miles of road: bituminous surface 313 miles, gravel surface 393 miles.

Port Louis, the capital of the island, is also the only port; it can accommodate ten ocean-going vessels at any one time, and four small vessels. Regular cargo services are provided from the United Kingdom by the Clan Line of steamers, Union-Castle Line and Bullard King Limited and from continental ports by the French companies Messageries Maritimes Limited and Nouvelle Cie Havraise Peninsulaire; a frequent service is also provided by a combined French and Swedish Company, Svedel Lines. Passenger services from the United Kingdom direct to Mauritius are infrequent; the French vessels direct from Marseilles to Mauritius provide the better service. The Dutch Royal Interocean Lines vessels call at Port Louis regularly on their Far East-South Africa-South America service, providing a regular passenger and cargo service to and from South Africa. During the year 1st July, 1952, to 30th June, 1953, a total of 313 vessels entered Port Louis giving a total of 1,098,112 net tons, an increase of 42 vessels over the previous year.

Broadcasting

Government runs the Mauritius Broadcasting Service, which has a monopoly in the Colony. The station operates on 220 metres, 1,364 kc/s medium wave and 19·90 metres, 15,075 kc/s short-wave with powers of 5 kW. and 1½ kW. respectively. In June 1953, there were 14,305 wireless licences in force in the Colony, with an estimate of five listeners per receiver. It is hoped that a new studio and a new transmitting building will be erected in the course of 1954 in connexion with a scheme of technical improvements.

Principal Occupations

Cane plantations and sugar manufacture give employment to some 4,300 skilled and some 50,000 unskilled workers. Other industries are tea planting and manufacture, employing some 1,400 workers; tobacco 1,900; aloe fibre 1,200. The docks give employment to about 1,300 workers; the building trade over 1,000; Government and public services 10,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar cane, "aloe" (Furcraea) fibre, tea and tobacco. Sugar is produced in 27 factories the modernization of which is nearly completed. Practically all the "aloe" fibre produced is utilized locally for the manufacture of sugar bags. The Colony grows some of its subsidiary foodstuffs, vegetables and a proportion of its vegetable oil requirements. Coconut oil is extracted at a factory in Port Louis from copra obtained from the dependencies known as the Oil Islands. The only by-product of sugar cane is alcohol, of which 66,490 hectolitres of 94° G.L. were produced in 1952.

The livestock population at a census in 1950 was: bovines 40,282 (of which 32,000 are of the local or "creole" milk breed); goats, 53,561; pigs, 4,000; sheep, 2,013.

The catch of fish in territorial waters is approximately 2,000 tons a year. Fishing is also carried out on the remote banks of the South Indian Ocean.

*Excluding value of sugar quota certificates.
The chief imports are grain and flour, edible oils and fats, petroleum products, textiles, vehicles, iron and steel goods and electrical goods, coal, cement and fertilizers.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The whole of the sugar produced is marketed by the Sugar Syndicate, the price of sugar being fixed by agreement with the Ministry of Food which bought the whole of the export crop in 1952 at £38 10s. 0d. per metric ton.

On the 30th of April, 1952, there were 250 registered co-operative societies with a membership of 18,526, paid-up share capital amounting to Rs.728,513 and General Reserves totalling Rs.552,182. The turnover in goods and services for the year was Rs.23,526,513. This figure of turnover included the value of agricultural produce marketed through the agency of agricultural credit and marketing societies consisting of Rs.10,905,446 of sugar sold through 119 credit societies and Rs.129,059 of ginger sold through one marketing society.
