**HONG KONG**

**Area**

The land area is approximately 391 square miles (Hong Kong Island 32 square miles, Kowloon 3½ square miles, Stonecutters Island ¼ square mile, New Territories (leased) 355 square miles). British waters comprise a rectangular area of some 710 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory and bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.

**Population**

The population of the Colony at the end of 1952 was estimated to be 2,250,000, of whom the overwhelming majority is of Chinese race, many being British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. The number of Europeans and Americans permanently resident, excluding Service personnel and their families, is about 15,000, including some 10,000 British subjects from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, 3,000 British subjects of Portuguese origin, and approximately 2,000 aliens. There are some 3,000 aliens temporarily resident.
member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of nine officials and eight unofficials, four of whom are Chinese and one Portuguese. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of five officials and ten unofficials, four of whom are elected.

Taxation

(1) Earnings and Profits Tax.—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:

(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).
(b) Salaries and Annuities Tax.
(c) Interest Tax.
(d) Property Tax.

The standard rate for 1953–54 is 12½% and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries and Annuities Tax is levied on income from employment earned by residents of the Colony after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($5,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $5,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $45,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries and Annuities Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged at one-half of the standard rate (i.e. 6¼%) on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony.

Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax as is the case under Salaries and Annuities Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.

(2) Estate Duty.—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 2% in the case of estates valued between $5,000 and $10,000, and 52% in the case of estates valued at over $30 million.

(3) Other Sources of Revenue.—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainment, Betting and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor, toilet preparations and table waters.

|          |              | 328,169,818      |

It is estimated that in 1953–54 $144,100,000 will be raised from direct and indirect taxes, $68,400,000 from Duties and $33,878,000 from Rates. For the same year the main heads of estimated expenditure are:

- Public Works: $83,946,466
- Police: $33,801,391
- Subventions: $25,176,790
- Medical: $23,860,262

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March, 1953, amounted to $61,802,000 (approximately $27.50 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:

- 4% Conversion Loan (1933)—$4,838,000 (Sinking Fund of $4,493,120.60).
- 3½% Dollar Loan (1934)—$3,720,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3½% Dollar Loan (1940)—$6,130,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3½% Rehabilitation Loan (1947–48)—$46,666,000 (Sinking Fund of $11,743,532.60).
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes—$448,000.

Currency

The value of the HK$, at approximately HK $1 = 1s. 3d., is kept stable in relation to the £ sterling by an Exchange Equalization Fund.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and to a small extent by two other Banks, and of $1 notes and nickel alloy 50 cent, 10 cent and 5 cent coins.

Development Plans

Over the next five years it is proposed to expend the sum of $230 million on major development projects, $168 million of which will be provided from current revenue and $62 million from the Colony's Development Fund.

The main items to be financed from the Development Fund are:

- Waterworks (new reservoir at Tai Lam Chung): $40 million
- Housing: $20 million
- Sports Stadium: $2 million

The main items to be financed from current revenue are as follows:

- New Schools: $6 million
- New Hospitals and Clinics: $35 million
- Government Offices: $25 million
- Government Quarters: $14 million
- City Hall: $16 million
- Reclamation Schemes: $10 million
- Piers: $14 million
- Roads: $17 million
- Abattoir: $15 million
- Drainage: $5 million

Education

In 1953 education was provided in 1,052 schools for over 201,000 pupils. This figure represents rather less than one in ten of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:

- Primary: 152,000
- Secondary: 42,000
- Post-secondary: 7,000
Private schools provided places for some 130,000 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 55,000; while 39 Government institutions catered for 16,000 children. There were 268 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies in 1952–53, including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $23 million as compared with $2½ million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.

The University of Hong Kong has 982 students in the following faculties—arts, science, medicine, engineering and architecture. The University receives an annual Government grant of $1,500,000 and has received in all some $15 million from Japanese assets taken over in the Colony as reparations. It will receive a further $1 million in 1953–54. Two projects have recently been instituted by the University—the Fisheries Research Unit and the Institute of Oriental Studies.

Libraries

Local libraries include an English and Chinese library at the University, a British Council library and a small educational library at the Education Department.

Health

The Health division undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and the inspection and treatment of school children. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda, the registration of births and deaths, pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work, and the carrying out of autopsies in the public mortuaries.

The Government maintains and operates eleven general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to five other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony ten private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups are 1,836, 1,494 and 938 respectively.

In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1952 totalled nearly 94,000, and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were just over 923,000. There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.

The general state of health is very good; there were no major epidemics except one of typhoid with 1,230 cases.

The most serious scourge is tuberculosis with over 14,800 cases notified in 1952 with 24% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned over 4,200 deaths; the infant mortality was 77·1 per 1,000 live births.

Government expenditure on these services during the year 1952–53 amounted to approximately $26 million, compared with $2 million in 1937.

Communications

Air.—The airfield at Kai Tak is limited in size by the geographical features of the neighbourhood, but international traffic continued steadily. During 1952 there were 12 companies operating regular international flights through the Colony, and the bulk of aircraft continued to be of the DC-3, DC-4, DC-6, Canadair and Constellation types. A total of 5,197 international flights of commercial aircraft carrying 86,775 passengers, 2,537,578 kilos of freight and 455,264 kilos of mail, in addition to transit traffic, was recorded during the year.

Rail.—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1952 amounted to 225,659 tons, and 3,554,280 passengers were carried.

Roads.—There are 432 miles of roadway, 90% of which is of metalled construction.

Shipping.—77,796 vessels entered and cleared during 1952–53; their net registered tonnage being 23,625,311. 1,761,803 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. A frequent ferry service crosses the harbour and links the principal islands to the westward.

Broadcasting

Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW.) from two separate stations, in English and three Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 2½ kW. There were 40,457 licence holders at the end of 1952. A private concern operates a rediffusion service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1952 there were some 46,000 subscribers to the service.

Principal Occupations

Most of the urban population is engaged in commerce or industry, and the rural population in agriculture or fishing. There has, however, been more industrial development in both the urban and rural districts and workers in registered and recorded factories and workshops now number 101,043 of whom 37,022 are women. There has been considerable fluctuation in employment during the year but reliable statistics of unemployment and under-employment are not obtainable, nor is it possible to collect statistics of outworkers and the hundreds of cottage type industries which abound, and in which it is estimated that another 100,000 persons are employed.

Figures for the main occupations are:

| Occupation                          | Number |
|-------------------------------------|--------|

*Reclassified in 1953 in accordance with I.L.O. definition which includes a wider field.
On 31st March 1952 there were 228 registered Workers' Unions with a declared membership of 176,233 and 76 Employers' Associations with a declared membership of 14,584.

Main Crops and Products

The total area now under cultivation is estimated at 31,000 acres, including 21,700 under paddy, 2,400 under vegetables, and 1,300 under orchard. Some 20,797 metric tons of milled rice are estimated to be grown annually.

The estimated number of cattle is 11,112 head and of pigs 33,000 head.

About 35,000 tons of fish were marketed in 1952-53, as against 30,500 tons in the previous year.

Iron ore, kaolin, wolfram ore, tin, molybdenum and lead are mined. In 1952, 127,512 tons of iron ore and 217,599 lb. of wolfram ore were produced. Mining of the latter is now under intensified supervision.

Local industries are responsible for approximately 25% of all Hong Kong's exports, there being about 2,000 registered factories manufacturing a wide variety of articles. The following figures show exports of locally-manufactured goods during 1952: cotton yarn, 32,000,000 lb. valued at $137.5 million; cotton singlets, 4,845,688 dozens, value $95.2 million; shirts, 1,086,574 dozens, value $49.2 million; enamel ware, value $44.2 million; electric torches, 1,973,650 dozens, value $40 million; cotton piece-goods, 17 million square yards, value $26 million; rubber footwear and canvas shoes, 417,463 dozen pairs, value $17.9 million; torch batteries, 54,625,324, value $13.9 million; preserved fruits, value $12.7 million; paints, varnishes, etc., value $9.8 million; aluminium ware, value $6 million; and vacuum flasks, 88,054 dozen, value $5.8 million.

Total cement production during the year was 68,145 tons.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are six Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies with a membership of over 1,200. Five of these Societies have federated and formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies. In addition three Boar Service Societies and one Irrigation Society have been formed. Two Fishermen's Thrift and Loan Co-operative Societies have been formed and fishermen are gradually becoming aware of the benefits of co-operation.

The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market at Kowloon from co-operative societies and seven collecting centres and depots in the New Territories; three of these are run by the farmers and are being encouraged to develop into co-operative societies.

Four Wholesale Fish Markets are now in operation, the latest having been opened in June, 1952, at Aberdeen, the main fishing port on Hong Kong Island. A revolving loan fund of a quarter of a million dollars has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; this fund has now almost completed its fifth revolution.
