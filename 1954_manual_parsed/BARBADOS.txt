BARBADOS

Area, etc.

Barbados is the most easterly of the Caribbean
islands. Its total area is 166 square miles.

Population

The population was estimated at 219,015 in
1952; the 1946 census gives the racial divisions
as:

| Race          | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|
| African descent | 77.27%     |
| Mixed descent  | 17.35%     |
| European descent | 5.11%      |

Geographical Features

The Island is comparatively flat, rising in a
series of tablelands marked by well-defined
terraces to the highest point (1,104 feet) at Mount
Hillaby. The north-east corner of the Island,
the Scotland area, is broken country, much
eroded and rather barren. The formation of the
rest of the Island is coral limestone. There are
no rivers, but deep gullies which fill with water
during heavy rain have cut their way through the coral terraces in many places. Indigenous forest covers about 46 acres.

Climate

The climate is not excessively hot. North-easterly trade winds blow steadily from December to June but during the remainder of the year, the wet season, the wind moves to the south-east and is less strong, resulting in humid, hotter conditions. The average temperature is 79°-8°. The rainfall is very varied: in the high central district the yearly average is 75 inches while in some of the low-lying coastal areas the average is 50 inches.

Principal Town

Bridgetown, the capital, is the only town. At the 1946 census its population was 68,924.

History

Uncertainty remains on some points in the early history of Barbados and differing versions have appeared from time to time. The brief account which follows is based on what is taken to be the most authentic version.

As far as is known the original inhabitants were the Arawak Indians who migrated from the mainland of South America. When they arrived is not known, but relics of their occupation down to the latter years of the sixteenth century have been discovered in various parts of the Island. By the time the English settlers came they had disappeared, partly through Carib raids from the neighbouring islands, and partly through the Spaniards who deported them to work in the mines of Hispaniola.

In spite of the belief to the contrary, there is no satisfactory evidence that the Olive Branch under Captain Catlin ever touched at Barbados when driven off its course from England to the River Wiapoco settlement in 1605 and fetched up at St. Lucia. The first Englishman to visit Barbados may have been Captain Simon Gordan, who claimed that he had landed some time before the settlement of 1627 and had found the Island uninhabited. He may, however, have been on a ship under the command of Sir Thomas Warner that visited sometime between 1620 and 1624 and found the Island suffering from such a severe drought that the latter preferred settlement of his colonists at St. Kitts. In 1624 or early 1625 a ship, belonging to Sir William Courteen and under the command of Captain John Powell, touched at Barbados, when en route from Pernambuco to England; some men were landed who erected a cross and on a tree nearby inscribed "James K. of E. and of this Island." On receiving Powell's information about Barbados Sir William Courteen fitted out an expedition to the Island under the command of his informant; but Powell, who carried letters of Marque, captured a Spanish or Portuguese prize and returned with it to Cowes in 1626. Courteen then fitted out a second expedition and in February, 1627, the William and John under the command of Captain Henry Powell—Captain John Powell's younger brother—landed 80 settlers. During 1627 and 1628 the colony grew rapidly and by the end of 1628 it was claimed that Courteen had planted 1,850 settlers. The Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I for all the Caribbean islands and landed settlers in 1628. At his death in 1636 his son leased the Island for 21 years to Lord Willoughby of Parham who assumed the government of the Island and during the Civil War held it for the Royalists until his capitulation to the Cromwellian fleet in 1652. A Governor was appointed by the Commonwealth in place of Lord Willoughby and at the Restoration the claims of the Carlisle Patent were revived. An agreement was reached by which the Patent was surrendered to the Crown for compensation in the form of 4½% duty on exports. This duty was a continual source of complaint but was not abolished until 1838 by Act of Imperial Parliament. The importance of the agreement, however, is that it marked the end of proprietary rule. Since its settlement Barbados has been a possession of Great Britain.

Constitution

The Charter of Barbados was ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1652. It provided, among other things, that the government of the Island should be vested in the Governor, Council and Assembly according to ancient and usual custom. The Island possesses a representative chamber of Legislature and a considerable measure of responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation. The Legislature consists of the Governor; the Legislative Council, consisting of 15 members appointed by Her Majesty; and a House of Assembly, consisting of 24 members, (two for each parish and two for the City of Bridgetown) elected for a period of five years by adult suffrage which was introduced in 1951. The registered number of voters was 96,000. The executive side of government is vested in the Governor and Executive Council, and, in most matters, in an Executive Committee. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary and the Attorney-General ex officio and such other persons as Her Majesty may appoint. The Executive Committee which was formed in 1881 by Act of the Legislature consists of the Executive Council, one member of the Legislative Council and four members of the House of Assembly appointed by the Governor.

On 1st February, 1954, a Ministerial system was introduced under which five Ministers became responsible for most departments of Government. The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears best able to command a majority in the House of Assembly, and appoints four other Ministers on his recommendation. The Premier becomes a member of Executive Council, while he holds office, and the other Ministers become the four "House Members" of Executive Committee. These changes have been introduced mostly by convention and have entailed only minor amendments of the Constitutional Instruments.

Land Policy

The systems of land tenure are similar to those of the United Kingdom.

Taxation

Income tax is the main form of direct taxation. The tax rates range from 3 cents on every complete $ of taxable income up to $500, to 75 cents on every complete $ of taxable income beyond $24,000. Tax is not paid on incomes below $720 per annum in the case of single individuals and $1,200 in the case of married persons. Deductions from taxable income of $240 are allowed for children or other dependants, in the latter case not exceeding two. Deductions are also permitted on life insurances. Companies pay a flat rate of 40%. The rate for life assurance companies is the average paid by an individual with a taxable income of $4,800.

Estate duties range from 1% on estates not exceeding $4,800 to 30% on estates over $1,920,000. In addition, succession duty ranges from 4½% between $96 and $2,400 to 2½% at values exceeding...
$9,600 where the successor is a lineal descendant or ancestor and from 2% to 10% where the successor is a stranger.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariffs and excise duty on rum production.

Currency notes are of denominations $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100. British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. The West Indian $ is fixed at 4s. 2d., that is $4·80 to £1 sterling.

**Development Plans**

In 1952 the Government introduced a Five-Year Plan of Development and Taxation covering the period 1952–57. The Plan envisages capital expenditure of $16,500,000 over the five-year period from the following sources:

- **Loan Funds**: $6,000,000
- **Available Funds**: $10,500,000

Included under "Available Funds" is the balance estimated at $1,000,000 of the Colony's allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945.

Main heads of proposed expenditure are:

- **Water Supplies**: $1,312,000
- **Housing**: $1,808,000
- **Medical Services**: $1,067,000
- **Education**: $1,433,000
- **Agriculture**: $698,000
- **Communications**: $1,307,000
- **Industrial Development**: $1,000,000

Certain other schemes, mainly agricultural, which are still under investigation, account for a further $2,000,000.

**Education**

Current policy aims at providing sufficient accommodation in the schools so that eventually compulsory education may be introduced by stages for children between the ages of 5 and 14.

Free elementary and secondary education is provided in elementary and "senior" schools throughout the Island. Fees are charged in aided and independent schools.

There are 124 public elementary schools which are entirely maintained by Government funds. During 1952–53 there was an average roll of 30,641 pupils (15,743 boys, 14,898 girls). There are ten government-aided secondary schools (three first grade and seven second grade) with an attendance of 3,019 pupils (1,996 boys, 1,023 girls).

A Teachers' Training College trains 32 teachers (16 men, 16 women) annually. Codrington College, affiliated to the University of Durham, functions mainly as a Theological College. There were 34 students in residence during 1952–53.

During the academic year 1952–53 there were 21 Government Scholars and Exhibitioners attending Universities overseas: nine in the United Kingdom, three in Canada, and nine at the University College of the West Indies.

Adult Education is provided by the Barbados Evening Institute in Academic, Commercial, Technical and Vocational courses for 1,500 students, and the Board of Industrial Training awards 48 bursaries annually for training under apprenticeship schemes with master workmen. Under the Five-year Plan preparations are being made for the establishment of a Technical Institute.

Expenditure on education services in 1952–53 was $2,163,846 compared with $269,342 in 1935–36, and $199,760 in 1925–26.

**Libraries and Museums**

A free Public Library (56,000 books) is maintained by Government. At British Council headquarters there are also a Music Library, and a Reference Library. The Barbados Museum and Historical Society possesses collections of books, pictures, models, specimens of birds and fishes, and a collection of relics of the original Arawak inhabitants of the island.

**Health**

The Barbados General Hospital has accommodation for 44 paying patients and 332 non-paying patients. In-patient attendances number about 10,000, out-patient attendances about 100,000 per annum. The Government maintains a mental hospital with accommodation for 320 males and 465 females and a leper hospital at which there are 34 patients. For the training of midwives the Government Maternity Hospital has accommodation for 20 expectant mothers. Each of the
11 parishes has an almshouse for the care of the destitute sick and for the housing of the aged and poor. These almshouses are on the medical side in the nature of cottage hospitals.

Preventive medicine is based on the Health Centre System. At present one Centre is operating and two more are proposed in the Five-Year Plan of Development.

Expenditure on Health Services amounted to $1,482,242 in 1952-53 compared with $206,870 in 1935-36 and $195,375 in 1925-26.

Communications

The airfield is at Seawell, about 12 miles from Bridgetown. The main airlines operating are the British West Indian Airways, linking with most of the other British West Indian Islands, Trans-Canada Airlines and British Guiana Airways.

There are 608 miles of road open to traffic, of which 458 are oil-emulsion surfaced.

Bridgetown is the only port of entry, although some loading of sugar takes place at Speightstown and oil is pumped ashore at Spring Gardens.

The main shipping companies visiting Barbados are Harrison Line, Elder and Fyffes Line, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa Steamship Company, Saguenay Terminals. Occasionally ships of Furness Withy, Moore McCormack, Blue Star, Lamport and Holt and Booth Lines visit port.

Broadcasting

A wired system, confined to Bridgetown and the suburbs, is operated by a local company—Barbados Rediffusion Service Limited. It has 6,720 subscribers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in the cultivation of the sugar crop and auxiliary occupations connected with the sugar industry. The 1946 census gives 25,245 persons engaged in agriculture, 14,226 in domestic service, 10,373 in the retail trade, and 7,801 in construction work. About 2,500 persons are engaged in the fishing industry.

There are seven trade unions with some 17,500 members.

Main Crops and Products

Sugar cane is the principal export crop grown on all plantations and on nearly all small holdings. In 1953, sugar production was the equivalent of 160,752 tons.

Yams, sweet potatoes, eddoes, cassava, maize and pigeon peas comprise the main food crops which are grown in accordance with regulations issued annually. Green vegetables and other crops are cultivated on a minor scale and there is a limited production of tree crops and citrus fruit.

The estimated numbers of livestock are as follows:

- Cattle, 15,050; Pigs, 24,367; Sheep, 33,444;
- and Goats, 16,099.

A Central Livestock Station has been established to investigate the possibility of developing an economic system of animal husbandry, with special attention to dairying.

A Fisheries Section of the Department of Agriculture has been established in recent years for the investigation of more efficient methods of marine fishing and to encourage their use. The estimated catch of fish during 1952 was 9,212,000 lb. valued at $1,382,000.

Production of natural gas during the year ended March 31, 1953, was 152,611 M.c.f. During the years 1951 and 1952 over 6,000 tons of temper, building and manurial limestone were exported.

Manufactures include the production of sugar for local consumption, rum, bread and a variety of biscuits, edible oil, aerated waters, cigarettes, soap, ice and furniture.
