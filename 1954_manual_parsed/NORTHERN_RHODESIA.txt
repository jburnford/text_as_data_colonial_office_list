NORTHERN RHODESIA

(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.)

Area

The Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia lies on the plateau of Central Africa. Its area is 288,130 square miles, including 3,000 square miles of inland water.

Population

The European population at 31st December, 1952, was estimated as 43,000, an increase of 6,000 on the 1951 census figure. There were also 4,300 Asiatics and Coloureds. The estimated African population at 31st December, 1952, was 1,930,000.

Geographical Features

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000–5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 703 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate

There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°–100°, but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature. The following tables indicate the mean maximum and minimum hot season temperatures and annual rainfall at certain places in the Territory:

History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. Lacerda, who visited Chief Kasembe's capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in June 1798. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty's Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be, and on 17th October, 1900, the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika's dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy of £850.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed, and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company, but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company's administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company, and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April, 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

Constitution

The constitution has been modified considerably since 1924. It provides for an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. There is a majority of unofficial members over official members in the latter. The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker, four ex officio members, four nominated official members, two nominated unofficial members appointed to represent the interests of the African community, twelve elected members and four African members. The Executive Council is presided over by the Governor and at present consists of five official members and four unofficial members. One of the unofficial members is a nominated unofficial member of the Legislative Council representing African interests.

Land Policy

Land is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land is alienated on leasehold tenure by the Land Board which insists on certain standards of finance and farming skill. There is in certain areas freehold land held by private persons who obtained title in the early days.

Taxation

Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 6s. and 17s. 6d. per annum. There are, in addition, certain levies generally varying between 1s. and 5s. per annum made by Native Authorities. Those who are liable to pay native tax do not pay income tax, but otherwise income tax is paid on all income accruing in Northern Rhodesia. In assessing the amount payable, unmarried persons are allowed a deduction from chargeable income of £350 and married persons a deduction of £700, the rates of tax being graduated from 1s. in the £ on the first £250 to 7s. 6d. on every £ of chargeable income in excess of £1,750; and from 1s. in the £ on the first £250 to 7s. 6d. on every £ in excess of £2,300 respectively. A deduction of £150 from chargeable income is allowed in respect of each child. Companies pay 7s. 6d. in the £.

Customs tariffs and excise duties are the main forms of indirect taxation.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation and the Northern Rhodesia Government are jointly financing the Chilanga Cement Company which started in 1951. The works are designed to produce 55,000 tons of cement a year and plans for trebling production have been approved.

The Hydro-electric Scheme at the Kafue Gorge has been accepted by the Governments of Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Detailed consideration is now being given to the methods of financing the scheme. It is expected that when complete the scheme will provide over 250 megawatts.

Northern Rhodesia is also interested in the project for harnessing the Zambezi River at the Kariba Gorge. Two new copper mines are to be opened in the near future. There is an Industrial Loans Board financed by the Government which assists in the establishment of new industries and in the expansion of existing industries in Northern Rhodesia.

Education

There are 24 Government schools, two Government-aided and seven private schools providing education for European children. Seven of the Government schools provide education up to Form V. There are five Government hostels where 360 children board. The enrolment in 1938 in Government schools was 1,048 and in 1952 was 6,766; in Government-aided and private schools it was 200 and 1,129 respectively. Technical training is given in conjunction with correspondence courses. Government assistance in the form of scholarships, bursaries and loans is given to those who proceed to higher education centres outside Northern Rhodesia. There were 87 students in receipt of such assistance in 1952.

At present there are seven Northern Rhodesia bursary holders studying in the United Kingdom, 19 in South Africa and six in Uganda.

There is one Coloured school, and financial assistance is given to those who cannot attend there. Similar assistance is given to Indian children who cannot attend the five Indian day schools.
Of the 340,000 African children of school age some 167,649 were in the following schools in 1952:

| No. of schools | No. of pupils, etc. |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools | 1,263 | 151,387 |
| Unaided primary schools | 254 | 13,937 |
| Secondary schools | 5 | 432 |
| Teacher training schools | 23 | 807 |
| Trades schools | 16 | 719 |
| Other vocational schools (girls) | 15 | 367 |

The only post-secondary course within the Territory is for the training of teachers in upper primary schools. Bursaries are awarded for students to attend various higher courses outside the Territory: 35 such bursaries were awarded in 1952. A comparison of recurrent expenditure is made below.

Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.

The rôle of the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute at Lusaka is primarily a sociological one. Since 1937 members of the Institute have been studying the customs of the African peoples, and others have been engaged in anthropological studies in the field.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia's National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

There are eight Government European hospitals in the Territory. During 1952 7,494 patients were admitted, while there were 33,660 attendances at the out-patient departments. The principal causes for admission were diseases of the respiratory system, infectious and parasitic diseases (excluding malaria), diseases of the digestive system, and malaria.

Approximately 38,630 persons were admitted during 1952 to the 14 African hospitals run by the Government, and there were 512,445 attendances at the out-patient departments. The principal causes of admission were infectious and parasitic diseases (excluding malaria), accidents, malaria, and venereal disease.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above, there are 91 Government Rural Health Centres. In 1952 there were approximately 18,000 in-patients, 350,000 out-patients and over 1,200,000 out-patient attendances.

Health Department expenditure over the last 25 years has shown a very great increase, being estimated at £775,155 in 1952, compared with £34,687 in 1926 and £60,429 in 1935.

Communications

There is an international airport at Livingstone and national airports at Lusaka, Ndola and Kasama, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. There are 42 other airfields, 19 of which are all-weather.

Internal services are operated by Central African Airways. External services are operated by B.O.A.C. and Springbok Airways.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo Border (at Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 642 miles. In the year ended 31st March 1952 the railways carried within Northern Rhodesia 636,294 passengers, 2,809,034 tons of freight and 93,319 head of livestock.

There are 17,937 miles of roads in the Territory, of which 295 miles are of first-class bituminous standard. The total mileage is made up of 4,352 miles of main roads, connecting towns or districts; 5,590 miles of district roads and 7,995 miles of branch roads.

The Zambezi River Transport Service Board of Control operates a transport service from Livingstone to Mongu (in Barotseland) which uses the Zambezi River for part of the route. The remainder is covered by road and railway. The amount of freight carried in 1952 was 1,500 short tons.

Broadcasting

A Government-operated studio and transmitter is situated in Lusaka. Signals are sent out on 15 kW. and 2½ kW. transmitters. Programmes in six African vernaculars and in English are radiated to Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Nyassaland for seven hours each day. Licences are not issued to listeners. It is estimated that most Europeans listen to some programme and about 80,000 Africans to the Lusaka broadcast. Re-diffusion sets have been set up in their location by the Lusaka Management Board.

Output of sawlogs, poles, and firewood amounted to 1,409,000 tons in 1952.

The chief minerals are copper, zinc, lead, and cobalt. Also produced are vanadium pentoxide, limestone, tin, manganese and gold. Total mineral production in 1952 was valued at over £79 million.

A very large variety of products are now being manufactured by more than 35 different concerns in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, steel finishing work, tiles, furniture, clothing, beer, soaps and oils, and metal castings.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru, and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is cured and marketed in the urban areas.
