UGANDA

Area
The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles, of which 13,689 are water and swamp.

Population
The total population of the Protectorate as shown by the 1948 census—excluding Polish refugees and a very small number of persons in transit—was 4,958,520, made up as follows:

- Africans: 4,917,555
- Indians: 33,767
- Goans: 1,448
- Arabs: 1,475
- Europeans: 3,448
- Others: 827

The estimated total in 1952 was 5,262,000.

Geographical Features
The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,000 feet or less in the neighbourhood of Lake Albert and the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges, the Mufumbiro or Birunga range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhvavura (13,547 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley with its twin peaks Margarita (16,794 feet) and Alexandra (16,749 feet) is the highest point. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasiem (10,050 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, which flows both east and west between Lake George and Lake Victoria, the Aswa, which rises north of Lake Kyoga and flows into the White Nile in the Sudan, and the Malawa, which rises in Mount Elgon and flows through the Mpologoma Swamp into Lake Kyoga. The total area of forest is approximately 2,684 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.

Climate
The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° and 75° and at Entebbe the mean temperature, the mean maximum and the mean minimum are 70°, 78°, and 63° respectively. The average annual rainfall varies between 40 and 55 inches, according to the area, over most of Uganda. The rainy season is not well-defined but there is generally one dry season from December to February and one fairly dry season from June to July.

Principal Towns
The principal towns are Entebbe (capital), Kampala and Jinja. Administrative and trading centres also exist at Tororo, Mbale, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale, Masaka and Mubende.

History
In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa’s dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there was a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company’s influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga’s Kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June, 1894.

Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga’s kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1900 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and he concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. The next year similar Agreements were made with the Chiefs in Toro and Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes, and the same principles of “indirect rule” were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1903 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika Territory. In 1905 the superintendence of the Protectorate’s affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.

Constitution
The Uganda Order in Council, 1920, provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, both consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated 5th June, 1920, as amended by subsequent instructions, the Executive Council consists of eight ex officio
members, and such other persons holding office in the Public Service (official members), and such other persons not holding such office (unofficial members), as the Governor may appoint, with the Governor as President. There are at present one official and six unofficial members. It is provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor as President, six *ex officio* members, with nominated and representative members. The Secretary of State approved an increase in the membership of the Legislative Council to nine *ex officio*, 19 nominated and 28 representative members from 1st January, 1954.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern, and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the remainder owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka with the advice of his three Ministers, the Chief Minister, Principal Judge and Treasurer. A hierarchy of chiefs are the executive officers of government. In other districts African local governments have been established, the principal officers being the Secretary-General, the Treasurer, and in some cases a Principal Judge. In the Agreement Districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro special conditions prevail. County, sub-county, parish and village chiefs are the executive officers of local government and are advised and assisted by councils, which are now established in every province. These are at five levels—the parish, the sub-county, the county, the district and the province—which provide a chain of election from the bottom upwards. In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces, the district council is the most important organ of government. In Buganda province, however, where the assembly is at the provincial level, district councils do not exist and unofficial members are elected direct from the county councils to the "Great Lukiko" (i.e. the council of Buganda). All Chiefs in Buganda and the three agreement districts are appointed by the Ruler with the approval of the Governor. Elsewhere appointment of Chiefs is by the Governor direct, though recommendations may come from a local council. Chiefs are now by legal definition the executive officers of local government and they combine in their functions administrative, judicial and fiscal duties.

**Land Policy**

Alienation of land to non-natives is now almost entirely suspended except for land required for mining purposes and within townships. Ownership of land may not be transferred to a non-native without the Governor's consent. There are a few non-native estates.

**Taxation**

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll taxes, export taxes, companies tax, Customs and excise.

**Income Tax** is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from, or received in, East Africa by residents, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents, after deducting any personal allowances. Any person liable to pay Native Poll Tax is exempt from paying income tax. This exempts all Africans. A surtax is imposed on every £ of total income in excess of £2,000, rising to Shs. 45,187/= on a total income of £9,500. Thereafter the next £10,500 is charged Shs. 10/= for every £ and the next £30,000, Shs. 10/50 for every £. Where total income exceeds £50,000 per annum the rate on the excess is Shs. 11/= in every £.

**Poll Tax** is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of Shs. 6/= per year with the exception that in Buganda province it is levied at the rate of Shs. 15/= or Shs. 10/= according to district and locality. A Native Administration Tax is levied by African local governments varying from Shs. 6/= to Shs. 22/= according to district. Non-Native Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £5 on incomes exceeding £200 per annum, and £3 on lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

**Export Taxes** are placed on lint, cotton and coffee and are operated on a sliding scale.

**Companies Tax** is levied at the rate of Shs. 4/= on every £ of chargeable income accrued in, derived from, or received in the Protectorate.

**Customs and Excise.** The tariff is divided into *ad valorem*, specific and free goods. *Ad valorem* duties vary from 10% to 60%, the latter assessment only applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations. The basic rate of import duty is 22% *ad valorem*. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:—Sugar, cigarettes, cigars, manufactured tobacco, beer.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 1,863,863   | 2,019,655      |
| 1948 | 6,405,030   | 6,530,444      |
| 1949 | 8,094,381   | 6,686,863      |
| 1950 | 11,036,701  | 8,000,380      |
| 1951 | 15,826,280  | 12,345,508     |
| 1952 | 17,289,018  | 15,950,996     |

In 1952, £8,269,108 of revenue was derived from export taxes, £3,917,872 from Customs and excise and £1,811,764 from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- **Productive Services**: £1,379,641
- **Social Services**: £2,552,218
- **Administration and miscellaneous**: £11,368,012

At the end of 1952 the Public Debt amounted to £9,933,000.

**Currency**

The currency is under the control of the East African Currency Board in London. The unit of currency is the shilling, which is sub-divided into 100 cents. Coins and notes of the following denominations circulate in Uganda:

- Coins: Sh. 1/=, 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent.
- Notes: Shs. 5/=, 10/=, 20/=, 100/=, and 200/=.

Shs. 1,000/= and 10,000/= notes are used only for transactions between the Banks and the Currency Board and are not in general circulation.

**Development Plans**

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945, Uganda has received allocations of approximately £2,500,000 towards development. In 1948 the Plan was revised and expenditure of £62,743,000 for the period 1947–56 anticipated.

Buoyant revenues coupled with the decline in the value of money has caused expenditure far to outstrip the scale envisaged when the Development Plan was drawn up. Thus in 1953 expenditure exceeded £18,000,000 as opposed to the total of just under £6,500,000 which was envisaged.
Other Development

The Government have established the Uganda Development Corporation with a capital of £5,000,000 to develop the resources of the Protectorate and to encourage and assist private enterprise in the establishment of new industries. The Corporation has taken over the Government's interest in the cement industry and in fish marketing and its plans for the future include engagement in the development of mining, hotels, textiles and paper manufactures. The mineral deposits at Sukulu, near Tororo, consisting principally of apatite, magnetite and pyrochlore, are being opened up by a syndicate, of which the Uganda Development Corporation is a partner. The copper and cobalt deposits at Kilembe are also being developed. The construction of the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja by the Uganda Electricity Board, a Government-financed utility corporation, is due for completion in 1954 and will provide an output of 90,000 kW. of power capable of subsequent expansion to 150,000 kW.

Education

There are 3,292 Primary schools, 155 Secondary schools and two institutes of higher education—Makerere College (the University College of East Africa) and the Government training college for Junior Secondary school teachers at Mbarara. In 1952 there were 272,816 pupils in Primary schools, 15,354 in Secondary schools (including 3,434 in technical schools) and 2,482 in teacher-training centres, 30 in the Government training college and 92 Uganda students at Makerere College. At the beginning of 1953, about 100 students were studying in the United Kingdom, of whom 55 were Africans (31 with Government Scholarships); six Africans were studying in the U.S.A. and 17 in India.

Apart from two full Secondary schools, the teacher-training college, and five Junior Secondary technical schools, all controlled by Government, African primary and secondary education is in the hands of the Missions who receive substantial grants-in-aid from Government. Government expenditure on African education amounted to £951,552 in 1952 out of a total of £1,255,395 for education as a whole. Government expenditure in 1935 was £76,093.

Health

Malaria, respiratory and intestinal infections, together with injuries are among the commoner conditions needing treatment. Yaws, schistosomiasis, venereal disease and leprosy are also important causes of ill-health, while malnutrition during infancy and anaemia are being increasingly recognized as major problems. Progress is being made in health education which aims especially at the improvement of rural sanitary conditions and the promotion of higher standards of personal hygiene.

The main hospitals for all communities are at Kampala. The largest Government African Hospital is on Mulago Hill, and is closely associated with the Makerere College Medical School. The Medical Department maintains 18 hospitals at district centres, together with eight rural hospitals and a network of 153 dispensaries. The dispensaries are in charge of medical auxiliaries. Missionary societies provide seven hospitals and 38 small units. The total number of beds available at hospitals and dispensaries throughout the Protectorate is 6,067, that is, 1·2 beds per 1,000 of the population.

In 1952 the number of patients admitted to Government hospitals was 80,990, and 744,616 were treated as out-patients. For all Government units, 2,321,752 patients were treated and 4,670,627 attendances were recorded.

Expenditure by the Medical Department rose from £148,907 in 1935 to £929,526 in 1952.

Communications

Entebbe has a first-class international airport and is a principal stopping place on the B.O.A.C. "Comet" route to South Africa. Other airlines operating through Entebbe regularly include Sabena and E.A.A.C., which give rapid connexions to all parts of the world. In addition Entebbe is a staging point on many charter flights. There are also landing grounds at Kasese, Jinja, Toro, Mbarara, Masindi, Gulu, Soroti, Arua, Lira, Moroto and Lolelia.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission") which also maintains a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga between Namasagali and Masindi Port; and on Lake Victoria between Port Bell, Entebbe, Kisumu and Tanganyika ports. A service is maintained on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule (connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan) and between Butiaba and the Belgian Congo port of Kasenyi. A road transport service operates between Masindi Port and Butiaba. A through service is thus provided by the Railway Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Belgian Congo.

There are 2,828 miles of all-weather main roads, for the most part radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres, and about 8,000 miles of roads maintained by the African local governments.

Broadcasting

A projected broadcasting service, which will be a responsibility of the Department of Information, is due to be in operation in 1954. The station will be at Kampala.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle raising on their own account. An analysis of the numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in agriculture and other occupations shows: agriculture 42,976; Government service 8,869; African local government 28,508; ginning 21,678; forestry and fishing 3,398; transport and communications 7,991; wholesale and retail trade 4,686; manufactures, including electricity 23,197; mining and quarrying 7,055; construction 39,819; education and medical services 9,297; other services 4,398: total 201,872.

The foregoing figures were obtained from a census covering all known employers of five or more persons excluding domestic servants. The figures are, therefore, not complete and many thousands of Africans working in ones and twos for African employers are also excluded.

Little interest has yet been shown in trade unionism, and there are only four registered trade unions. The formation of joint staff committees and works councils is actively encouraged and this simple form of industrial relations machinery has now been introduced in 43 of the larger employing establishments in different parts of the country covering some 29,000 employees.
Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), groundnuts, maize, sugar, tea, and tobacco.

The number of cattle marketed in 1952 was 81,854.

Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hardwoods. Internal consumption is rising rapidly and most of the timber available for export is absorbed by the other East African territories, from which in return the bulk of the Protectorate's softwood imports are obtained. In 1952 some 32,000 tons of sawn timber were produced compared with 25,120 tons in 1947.

The chief minerals are tin and wolfram of which 153 and 107 long tons respectively were produced in 1952. In addition small quantities of gold, niobium-tantalum, galena and bismuth are produced.

Fishing is an important industry and large quantities of fish are consumed by the African population. There is also a considerable export trade.

The cement factory of Uganda Cement Industries has recently come into production at Tororo, and preliminary steps for the erection of a textile factory at Jinja have been completed. In the 1952-53 season 160 cotton ginneries were operating, 33 of them having been acquired by Government under the legislation for the reorganization of the cotton industry as being uneconomic or redundant. The coffee crop is handled by six coffee curing works and seven hulleries, the latter carrying out the early stages of processing only. There are in addition a number of estate coffee curing factories which handle coffee grown on the larger estates. Technical improvements with coffee are constantly being made. Among other undertakings for the processing of agricultural produce are two sugar factories, 14 tea factories, 29 oil mills, one tobacco manufacturing firm and 121 registered maize mills.

Other undertakings are a brewery, an aluminium ware factory, a tannery, ten sawmills and 52 soap factories scattered throughout the Protectorate. Of the latter, however, only a few have modern machinery and plant sufficient to rank them as factories, the rest being more of the nature of cottage industries.

Trade

Excludes all inter-territorial trade with Kenya and Tanganyika.

| Year | Net Imports £000 | Re-exports £000 | Domestic Exports £000 |

| 1952 | 24,296           | 482              | 47,223                |

(These figures include bullion and specie)

In 1952 52% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 15% from other Commonwealth countries, 29% from foreign countries and 4% unallotted.

In 1952 25% of domestic exports went to the United Kingdom, 39% to other Commonwealth countries, and 36% to foreign countries. In 1938 the corresponding percentages were 18%, 67% and 15%.

Principal Exports by Volume and Value

| Item          | 1938 | 1951 | 1952 |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| Cotton        | 000 tons | 72   | 62   | 67   |
| Cotton Seed   | 000 tons | 123  | 31   | 28   |
| Coffee        | 000 cwts.| 307  | 658  | 634  |
| Hides and Skins | 000 cwts.| 328  | 13,654 | 12,345 |
| Sugar         | 000 cwts.| 139  | 7    | —    |
| Fish          | tons    | 682  | 2,145 | 2,197 |

The principal imports are machinery, motor cars and bicycles; cotton piece-goods and other textiles; corrugated iron and steel manufactures; fuels and lubricants and cement.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Provision has been made by legislation for the organized marketing of cotton and coffee, the two main cash crops of the Protectorate. Legislation which was enacted in the middle of 1953 provides, among other things, for increased African participation in the producing side of the coffee industry. Producer prices are announced before the marketing season opens and it is also the practice to announce a minimum guaranteed price for cotton at planting time. The Cotton Price Assistance Fund at the end of the 1952-53 season stood at slightly more than £20 million. A sum of £14½ million has already been voted into the African Development Fund which provides the finance for a number of schemes for the benefit of the African community. The Coffee Price Assistance Fund stood as at 30th June, 1953, at about £13 million. This fund has been built up of contributions from African produced coffee for the benefit of the African producers only and Legislative Council is to decide whether any proportion of it should be paid into the African Development Fund.

The number of co-operative societies had grown from four in 1947 to 584, including ten co-operative unions, at the end of 1952. Since then the number has grown to 665 primary societies and ten co-operative unions. Co-operative societies had a membership at the end of 1952 of nearly 54,000 and marketed produce valued at almost £1,100,000 during that year.

Five cotton ginneries are now being run by African Co-operative Unions. Under the Acquisition of Ginneries Ordinance, 1952, Government has powers over a five-year period to acquire up to 20 ginneries for operation by African co-operative enterprise, and a further three ginneries were acquired at the close of the 1952-53 cotton season.
