Jamaica is an island situated in the Caribbean Sea, about 90 miles south of Cuba. Its area is 4,411.21 square miles. The Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands are 166 square miles and 100 square miles in area respectively.

Population
The mid-year estimate of population in 1952 was 1,457,000. At the 1943 census the total population was 1,237,063 with the following racial origins:

- European: 13,809
- African: 965,960
- East Indian: 21,393
- Syrian: 834
- Chinese: 6,879
- Mixed or Coloured: 227,148
- Not specified: 1,040

Geographical Features
The Island is mountainous and rises in the centre to 7,402 feet (Blue Mountain Peak). The area of land over 1,000 feet above sea level is 2,110 square miles. There are numerous rivers. Forest lands comprise about 400,000 acres, of which 232,000 constitute the Government Forest Reserves.

Climate
Generally speaking, the rainy months are May and October but in the extreme north-east winter rains fall between November and January. The heaviest annual rainfall, which exceeds 200 inches, occurs near the Blue Mountain Ridge in the north-east, the lowest in the extreme south. Hurricanes occur on the average once in seven years. The following table shows temperatures and rainfall for selected areas in 1952.

Principal Towns
The capital is Kingston, which, together with Port Royal, has an estimated population of 138,887. The other principal towns are:

Montego Bay: 11,547
Spanish Town: 12,007

(1943 census)

History
The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted for over a century and a half. When the riches of Mexico and Peru were opened up by the conquistadores, the Spaniards flocked to the mainland from the island colonies and Jamaica became little more than a supply base for expeditions to the mainland of America. The population, which had never been very great, dwindled to an insignificant and impoverished community which offered little resistance to the English invasion under Admiral Penn and General Venables in 1655. With this date the modern history of the Jamaican people may be said to begin. The last attempt to recover the island for Spain collapsed and the last remnant of the Spaniards left Jamaica from Runaway Bay in 1660. The Spaniards had imported slaves from Africa, most of whom they took with them, but a small number remained in the mountains of the interior and formed the nucleus of the Maroons. Of the present community, the founders and pioneers were colonists who came from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the seventeenth century.

Constitution
On the 5th May, 1953, the Constitution granted in 1944 was extended by the Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council, 1953, the principal features of which provide for:

1. The appointment of a Chief Minister and seven Ministers charged with the responsibility of Government Departments by the Governor on the recommendation of the Chief Minister;
2. The replacement of five elected members in Executive Council by eight Ministers thereby ensuring a majority of the elected element in that body.

The present constitution provides for a Privy Council, an Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

The Privy Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, two Government officials and two nominated unofficial members. It advises the Governor in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government service and in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy.

The Executive Council is presided over by the Governor and consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, two unofficial nominated members from the Legislative Council and eight Ministers.

The Legislature consists of two Houses, the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives.

The Legislative Council consists of three ex officio members, not more than two official members and not less than ten unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The Council elects one of its unofficial members who is not a member of the Executive Council to be its President.

The House of Representatives consists of 32 members elected by adult suffrage from constituencies into which the Island is divided. At its first meeting the House elects one of its members to be Speaker. The Chief Minister and seven Ministers are appointed by the Governor from among its members. In the case of the Chief Minister, the name of the person whom it is proposed to appoint is submitted to the House for approval before appointment is made. The seven Ministers are appointed on the recommendation of the Chief Minister.

Land Policy
Appreciable areas of Government-owned lands, with the exception of Forest Reserves, have been disposed of under the existing Land Settlement Scheme, which is a freehold system of tenure.
However, in recent years, experiments have been carried out under a leasehold scheme. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

**Taxation**

The main heads of direct taxation are: Income tax, land and property tax, death duties—namely, (a) estate, (b) legacy and (c) succession duties—and the licence duty on motor vehicles and on other personal properties. Taxes on real properties are collected on the basis of the improved value. This is defined as the actual present gross value of the property.

Indirect taxation comprises Customs duties, excise duties, entertainment duty and certain licences and fees. Essential foodstuffs are either free of Customs duty or at low rates. Several industries are granted duty-free admission of building materials, plant and equipment.

**Public Finance**

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39  | 2,840,142  | 2,854,021       |
| 1948–49  | 9,712,942  | 10,130,204      |
| 1949–50  | 10,002,635 | 9,890,329       |
| 1950–51  | 10,938,887 | 10,342,339      |
| 1951–52  | 13,798,426 | 14,346,654      |
| 1952–53* | 13,791,071 | 14,427,671      |

* Revised Estimates.

It was estimated that in 1952–53 £7,274,000 of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and £2,830,000 from direct taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were estimated to be:

- Administration, Law and Justice: £3,198,657
- Communications: £2,838,917
- Education: £1,759,305
- Public Health: £1,648,212
- Social Welfare: £1,457,658

The substantial deficits in 1951–52 and 1952–53 have resulted largely from rehabilitation expenditure following the hurricane of 1951. The revenues for these two years include receipts of approximately £1,000,000 in each year in respect of hurricane rehabilitation assistance received from Her Majesty's Government. In addition, receipts from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds totalled £669,000 in 1951–52 and £696,000 in 1952–53.

A Loan of £3,500,000 was successfully raised on the London Market in early 1953 and the Public Debt now stands at £17,570,000 with Sinking Funds amounting to approximately £3,500,000.

**Development Plans**

The Government has issued a statement of policy which accepts most of the recommendations of the Report of the International Bank Mission which visited Jamaica in 1952. This Report is to be used as the framework of the Development Plan over the next ten years.

**Currency**

British silver and cupro-nickel coins of all denominations circulate freely. Nickel and bronze alloy subsidiary coinage of 1d., ½d., and ¼d. denominations are in circulation. Jamaica Government currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1953, amounted to £4,227,701.

**Education**

The University College of the West Indies, at Mona, near Kingston, has faculties of Arts, Science and Medicine. In the 1952–53 session there were 252 students. Technical education is available at the Kingston Technical School which had 501 students in 1952. The Government awarded nine scholarships for higher education in 1952, tenable at University College or in the United Kingdom or Canada. There were 39 Jamaicans with scholarships at Universities in the United Kingdom and three in Canada. In addition there were 182 private Jamaican students at Universities in the United Kingdom and about 225 in North America. In 1952 there were 27 secondary schools with an enrolment of 7,433 and 708 primary schools with an enrolment of 213,564.

Expenditure on educational services in 1952 was £2,108,542, of which about £25,718 was contributed by the United Kingdom. In 1935 expenditure was £226,392.

**Health**

During 1951 the Government spent approximately £2,164,748 on its medical services, which are organized on an island-wide basis. This figure excludes the cost of maintenance and the construction of buildings. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £191,207.

There have been no epidemics in the Island for many years. Disease rates compare favourably with more advanced countries nearby, e.g. the United States of America and Canada. Among the colony's main diseases are: helminthiasis, yaws, malaria, venereal diseases and pulmonary tuberculosis.

Each of the Island's 14 parishes has a full-time Medical Officer (Health), in charge of public health services, and a staff of sanitary inspectors, public health and district nurses. In the head office in Kingston are specialist officers who are responsible for the various phases of public health activities, which include epidemiology, health education, quarantine, public health nursing and control work in tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws and malaria. There are three mobile health units which carry on a generalized public health programme in different areas.

The following are the government hospitals in Jamaica:

- 21 general hospitals (2,427 beds).
- Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital (200 beds and 111 cribs).
- George V Memorial Sanatorium for chest diseases (222 beds).
- Tuberculosis Hospital (192 beds).
- Mental Hospital (2,842 beds).
- Hansen Home for the treatment of leprosy (188 beds).

There are altogether 119 hospital outstations and dispensaries. The figure for out-patient attendance during 1952 was approximately 453,374.

**Communications**

The main airfields are at Palisadoes and Montego Bay and there are five private strips. Braco was recently activated and is being used by Jamaica
Flying Club members and private owners. It is assumed that this runway will be used by airlines operating internal air services. Vernam Field is still de-activated. Palisadoes, the Port of Entry, is used by B.O.A.C., British West Indian Airways, Pan American World Airways, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Trans-Canada Air Lines, Delta Chicago, and Southern Air Lines, Caribbean International Airways, Avianca Airlines and numerous non-scheduled operators on international routes. Montego Bay is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways and Avianca. Meteorological services are provided by the British Caribbean Meteorological Services, and air services are under the control of the Civil Aviation Department. Aeronautical telecommunications facilities are provided by Messrs. International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited.

The Jamaica Government Railway has 246 miles of railway line. The main routes are:

(a) Kingston–Montego Bay.
(b) Kingston–Port Antonio.
(c) Kingston–Frankfield.
(d) Kingston–Linstead.

During the financial year 1952–53, the railway carried 940,386 passengers who paid £115,131, and 409,159 tons of freight from which £288,919 was earned. Over two miles of track have been laid in connexion with the operations of the bauxite companies now operating in Jamaica.

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring; the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the Island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum gradients are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,601 miles of main roads, of which 713 miles are asphalted, the remainder being of waterbound macadamized surface; and about 4,438 miles of parochial roads, of which approximately 2,137 miles are suitable for motor traffic.

The principal ports are Kingston, Montego Bay and Port Antonio. Regular cargo and passenger services are maintained with the United Kingdom by Messrs. Elders and Fyffes, the Jamaica Banana Producers' Association, the Royal Mail Lines, the Harrison Lines and the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique; with Canada by the Canadian National Steamship Company and Saguenay Terminals Limited; with the United States of America by the United Fruit Company and the Alcoa Steamship Company. Bulk cargoes of petroleum products are imported from Trinidad and Aruba. There was a total importation of 601,176·6 tons of cargo during 1951 and exportation of 276,798·2 tons. The total export through the Port of Kingston was 125,339·09 tons.

Broadcasting

The Jamaica Broadcasting Company Limited operates a commercial broadcasting service for the Island using short and medium wave with a power of 5,000 watts. The Company also operates a wired rediffusion service in urban and suburban Kingston. At the end of July 1953 there were over 4,000 subscribers. It is estimated that the radio audience is approximately 225,000. Ten per cent. of the Company's time is used by the Government of Jamaica and the Company relays several hours per week from the B.B.C.

Principal Occupations

In 1943 the gainfully employed population was 505,092, the numbers in some occupational groups being:

| Occupation                  | Number |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture                 | 221,376|
| Services                    | 102,441|

| Textile products            | 25,673 |
| Transport                   | 11,429 |

Aided by the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Law, the industrial development of the Island has continued. At the end of 1952 the number of registered factories was 730 employing 26,754 persons. As at 31st July, 1952, there were 13 registered trade unions with a total membership of 89,736. The largest, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union, had an approximate membership of 64,679 on 31st March, 1952.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar cane, bananas, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, pimento, citrus, rice, maize. In 1951, 2,425,749 tons of sugar cane and 5 million 24-lb. bunches of bananas were produced.

Products and manufactures include sugar, cornmeal, condensed milk, margarine, butterine, lard, rum, beer, cigarettes, matches; 521,802,000 cigarettes were made in 1952.

Minerals won are bauxite, quantities of which are exported for processing, and gypsum.

(a) Provisional.

(Exports include ships' stores.)

In 1938 33·5% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 32·1% from other Commonwealth countries, and 34·4% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were: 41·5%, 20% and 38·5%.

In 1938 58·4% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 27·9% to other Commonwealth countries, and 13·7% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 63·9%, 20% and 16·1%.

The chief imports are food, drink and tobacco, wheaten flour, rice, cotton and artificial silk piece-goods, fuel oil, motor spirit, footwear, motor cars, cement, chemical fertilizers.
Tourist Trade

The value of tourist trade in 1951 was estimated to be £4,022,476 and had increased in 1952 by 5·6% to £4,249,172.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The major export crops are handled by the following marketing organizations:

- The Marketing Department (formerly the Department of Commerce and Industries).
- The Coffee Industry Board.
- The Cocoa Marketing Board.
- The Sugar Manufacturers' Association (of Jamaica) Limited.
- The Citrus Growers' Association.

Under the Coffee Industry Regulation Law (Law 43 of 1948) and the Cocoa Marketing Law (Law 40 of 1951), the Coffee Industry Board and the Cocoa Marketing Board were appointed on the 6th December, 1948 and 13th December, 1951 respectively. These Boards are given wide statutory powers to regulate and develop these industries.

The Exports Division of the Marketing Department is the sole exporter of pimento, coffee and cocoa (the last two on behalf of the coffee industry and Cocoa Marketing Boards) except for the Blue Mountain type coffee, which is handled by a group of pre-war dealers.

The Sugar Manufacturers' Association (comprising all the sugar manufacturers in Jamaica) provides the liaison between the sugar industry, the Government of Jamaica, and overseas interests. It deals with all aspects of the sugar industry, and sells co-operatively sugar for local consumption and all rum and other by-products.

With reference to exports, the position has recently changed. During the war and up to 1952 when the British Ministry of Food purchased the entire exportable surplus, the Sugar Manufacturers' Association acted for the entire industry. The position now is that under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21st December, 1951, Jamaica is entitled from this year onwards, to a Global quota, divided into a Negotiated Price Quota and a Free Quota. The former is sold to the Ministry of Food at annually negotiated prices, and the latter is disposed of through commercial channels, as in the years before the war.

Through its subsidiaries, the Sugar Manufacturers' Association maintains substantial interests in firms engaged in the manufacture of commodities ancillary to the sugar industry, e.g.:

- Wholly owned subsidiaries—Jamaica Carbonics, Ltd.; Anhydrous Alcohol, Ltd., and
- Partly owned subsidiary—Jamaica Oxygen and Acetylene, Ltd.

The Citrus Growers' Association has full responsibility for the industry, and is the sole exporter of citrus, which is marketed co-operatively for its members. It operates a processing plant and packing house, which, together with independent processors and packers, obtain quotas of fresh fruits for packing and canning. These arrangements do not include limes, lemons and ugils.

On the 31st of December, 1952, there were 88 Co-operative societies with 12,531 members, and total Share Capital of £100,833 registered under the Co-operative Societies Law. Of these, 48 were Credit Societies operating principally in the urban areas; 3 were Agricultural Credit Societies operating in the rural areas amongst farmers; 10 were Consumer Societies; 20 were Producers', Marketing and Processing Societies; 2 were Transport and Tillage Societies; 2 were Co-operative Farming Societies; 1 was a Housing Society and 2 were Central Societies, 1 for Credit Societies in urban areas and the other for Marketing Societies.

The Credit Societies made loans amounting to £122,636 and recovered £74,799 during the year. The value of goods sold in Consumer Societies was £68,486 and the value of produce marketed through Marketing Societies was £74,610.

CAYMAN ISLANDS

Area

The Islands consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

Population

At the 1943 census the population was 6,670: Grand Cayman 5,311, Cayman Brac 1,296, Little Cayman 63. Roughly classified according to racial origin 1,052 are of African, 3,518 of mixed and 2,100 of European descent. The estimated population at the end of 1952 was 7,651.

Geographical Features

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is about 17 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to seven miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

Climate

From November to March it is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, and temperatures range from 60° to 75°. In the summer the range of temperature is some 10° higher and during certain periods mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1952 was 64.35 inches. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, resulting in considerable depopulation of the latter. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system.

Principal Towns

Georgetown and West Bay have populations of 1,462 and 1,866 respectively.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown, the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1734. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for long a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1774 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 933, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

Constitution

The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 27) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica, and these, with 27 elected members known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly of Justices and Vestry under the presidency of the Commissioner. The present constitution dates from 1832.

Land Policy

All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation

A poll tax of 8s. per adult male between the ages of 16 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 15% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

* Revised Estimates.
† Estimates.

In 1952–53, £35,500 was estimated to be derived from Customs receipts and £8,500 from the sale of postage stamps. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Treasury, Customs and Post Office £10,528, Education £7,467, Medical £5,771 and Public Works Recurrent £5,252.

The Public Debt as at 31st March, 1953, was as follows:

- Hurricane Loan 1932: outstanding £1,127.
- Public Works Loan, 1932: outstanding £2,796.

Reserve Funds at that date totalled £36,871.

Development

The Islands have benefited to the extent of £96,568 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. This sum has been devoted to the erection of a new hospital on Grand Cayman, airfield construction, to the improvement of educational facilities, road construction, agricultural education, and health measures mainly directed to the destruction and control of mosquitoes. Excellent results have been achieved in all fields except agriculture, which, in a community persistently addicted to the sea rather than to the land, has made only limited progress.

During 1952 the Colonial Development Corporation completed and put into operation a cannery on Grand Cayman for processing turtle and manufacturing turtle soup. It is hoped to build up a substantial market in the United States.

Education

There is compulsory free elementary education in 12 Government Schools; expenditure in 1952–53 amounted to £7,467 compared with £1,275 in 1938. Attempts are being made to run three private Secondary Schools in Grand Cayman, but these receive no financial support from Government at present.

Health

Expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1952–53 was £5,771, compared with £1,091 in 1938. The new hospital has accommodation for 28 patients. Medical Officers are seconded to the Dependency from Jamaica.

Communications

Construction of the airport at Crewe Road site in Grand Cayman has been completed and is used by B.W.I.A. and Lineas Aereas Costaricensis.

A regular three-weekly steamship service is maintained from Kingston to all three islands, and there is a regular air service between Kingston, Grand Cayman and Belize, and between Kingston, Grand Cayman and Miami. It is hoped also to initiate a service to Havana. There is also more or less regular communication with Kingston, Florida and Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels. Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, but no roads exist in Little Cayman. Wireless stations are maintained by Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. There are no broadcasting services.

Principal Occupations

The chief industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export or conversion to turtle soup. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment on the mainland of America, and in United States, Central and South American ships. Their remittances to their families enable a standard of living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, but no unions have been registered.

Crops and Products

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone soil. The main export products of importance are turtle and turtle soup, the value of which in 1952 was £9,824 and £35,518 respectively. The manufacture of thatch rope is the mainstay of the poorer people and forms a considerable export to Jamaica.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The only marketing organization, the Cayman Turtle Association, Limited, was formed in 1951; it works in close association with the Colonial Development Corporation cannery. There are two small co-operative societies at West Bay and East End.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

Area

The Turks Islands Bank and the Caicos Bank cover an area of approximately 70 by 50 miles. The total land area is estimated at 166 square miles.

Population

In 1952 the population was estimated at 6,600: Turks Islands 2,175, Caicos Islands 4,425. Of the total, 80 were of European, 4,441 of African and 2,079 of mixed descent.
Geographical Features

Geographically the islands are a part of the Bahama chain and have the same flat characteristics, there being no land above 250 feet. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by a 20-mile stretch of ocean water known as the Turks Islands passage; the Caicos Islands are surrounded by a shallow water reef. The islands generally are arid and stony.

Climate

The south-east trade winds blow constantly throughout the year, giving an equable and healthy climate. Rainfall is variable and tends to be higher in the Caicos Islands; on Grand Turk the annual average is about 21 inches. The mean annual temperature in 1952 was 79.2°. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1926, 1928 and 1945.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable and Wireless Limited at Grand Turk.

Principal Towns

The towns and largest settlement are Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour (South Caicos) and Bottle Creek (North Caicos), with populations of 1,945, 940 and 1,850 respectively.

History

The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the southern States of America after the War of Independence. After the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, their former slaves remaining in possession. In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, but in 1848 a separate charter was granted to the islands divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas. After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 petitioned Her Majesty that the islands might be annexed to the Colony of Jamaica and from 1874 to the present time they have been one of its dependencies.

During the second world war an anti-aircraft battery was stationed at Grand Turk, and a U.S. Air Force Base was established on South Caicos. This was closed in 1946. In 1953 the U.S. Government completed a Guided Missiles Observer Station at Grand Turk, under an extension of the Bahamas Agreement.

Constitution

An Order in Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica made provision for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. This Board now consists of four official and four unofficial nominated members appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. The Commissioner is ex officio President of the Board, which has full legislative and budgetary powers, but ordinances require the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming law. Laws passed by the Legislature of Jamaica do not apply to the Dependency unless they are made applicable in express terms. The revenues and expenditure are independent from those of Jamaica.

Land Policy

Much of the land on the salt islands is held on private freehold title. The law limiting the rights of aliens to own land was repealed in 1953.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are Customs import duties, royalty on salt and export duties on crawfish and conchs.

Public Finance

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39 | 9,780      | 13,830          |
| 1948–49 | 71,132     | 51,810          |

| 1950–51 | 77,297     | 91,588          |
| 1951–52 | 121,767    | 143,213         |
| 1952–53 | 78,389     | 75,760          |

The estimated revenue and expenditure for 1953–54 are £66,842 and £66,594 respectively.

Development Plans

Up to March 31, 1953, the total assistance approved under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, 1940 and 1945, for the Dependency by way of grant amounted to £152,850, plus an interest-free loan of £50,000 towards the cost of taking over the salt industry from its previous owners. The main heads of expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds up to the end of 1955–56 are estimated to be as follows:

| Head                      | Amount (£) |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Agriculture and Minor Industries | 18,710     |
| Communications            | 17,786     |
| Education                 | 21,965     |
| Miscellaneous             | 8,898      |
| Public Health             | 40,602     |
| Salt Industry             | 81,310     |
| Social Welfare            | 3,062      |
| Water Supplies            | 10,517     |
| **Total**                 | **£202,850** |

Other Development

Prior to 1953 90% of the import trade of the Dependency was handled by the Competent Authority, a department of the Government. The profits on a turn-over of some £130,000 were almost entirely devoted to food subsidization. All food subsidies ceased on 1st April, 1952, and in November of that year the Competent Authority's department was converted into a government-owned trading corporation known as the Turks Islands Importers, Ltd. No further government-sponsored development is envisaged, and great difficulty is being experienced in meeting the recurrent costs of the developments effected in recent years.

Education

There are 12 Government Elementary Schools and one Senior School in the Dependency. In 1951 the Senior School had an average attendance of 40. There were some 1,000 pupils on the rolls of the Elementary Schools and the average attendance was 704. Expenditure on education during 1952–53 amounted to £4,765, compared with £840 in 1935.

Health

A 14-bed cottage hospital of modern design has just been completed at Grand Turk, together with a dental clinic. 5,000 cases were treated at the dispensary in 1951. Medical officers, seconded from Jamaica, are stationed at Grand Turk and at East Harbour on South Caicos. There is a maternity clinic at Bottle Creek on North Caicos. Total expenditure on medical services in 1952 was £7,528, compared with £990 in 1935. Half the salaries of all trained staff is now contributed by the Jamaica Government.
Communications

There are airfields at Grand Turk and South Caicos. The latter has been taken over by the U.S. authorities and is at present being used as an observation post for guided missile operation. A weekly air mail service operates through Nassau in the Bahamas. There is a monthly mail, freight and passenger service to Jamaica by sea and ships call occasionally from England and the United States.

Grand Turk is an important junction of cables to Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda. A radio telephone system connects Grand Turk with Salt Cay and the Caicos as well as providing a service with Jamaica and the United States.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of the Turks Islands group and of South Caicos are normally engaged in the production (by solar evaporation) and shipping of salt, but the industry is now in a state of acute depression owing to lack of modern loading facilities. The remainder of the Caicos population are mainly fishermen, and do a limited amount of subsistence agriculture. A large proportion of the male population is usually absent from home working in the Bahamas lumber camps, the Inagua salt works or as crews on merchant ships.

Main Crops and Products

Sisal is grown under conditions of peasant agriculture in the Caicos Islands, but the quality is poor, owing to the absence of fresh water for retting and washing. During 1952 about 80 tons were exported. Salt is the main product of the Dependency and the output over the past 25 years has averaged about 43,000 tons annually. Crawfish are exported frozen to Florida, and conchs are sold dried in Haiti.

| Year | Imports | Exports |

| 1951 | £127,125 | £56,923 |
| 1952 | £133,041 | £33,509 |

In 1938, 8·1% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 21·8% from other Commonwealth countries, and 70·1% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 14·1%, 49·2% and 36·7%.

In 1938, 6·4% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 57·7% to other Commonwealth countries, and 35·9% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were: Nil, 61·2% and 38·8%.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Grand Turk Credit Union, Limited, incorporated in 1947, has 80 members and share capital of £1,000.
