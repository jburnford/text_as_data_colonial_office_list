KENYA

Area

The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East African Protectorate, includes parts of the great African Lakes, Victoria, Nyanza and Rudolf; the land area is approximately 219,730 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 224,960 square miles.

Population

At 1st July, 1953, the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at over 5·8 million persons, of whom over 5·4 million

The 1948 census showed a total non-African population of 154,846 of whom 90,528 were Indians, 29,660 Europeans and 24,174 Arabs. The non-African population at the middle of 1953 has been estimated at 210,000.

Geographical Features

Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Teita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Kulal, 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,040 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,104). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30–40 miles wide and 2,000–3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

Climate

The climate varies greatly. Three broad divisions exist:

1. The coast and its immediate hinterland;
2. The low plain, 300–2,000 feet, extending from the borders of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to the boundary of Tanganyika;
3. The Highlands, 3,000–10,000 feet.

History

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1947 which supersedes the original agreement of 1908.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which a rent of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution

Under Additional Royal Instructions of 1951, 1952 and 1953, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Deputy Governor, the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and Member for Legal Affairs, the Financial Secretary and Member...
for Finance and Development, the Chief Native Commissioner and Member for African Affairs, the Member for Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Deputy Chief Secretary and Member for Education and Labour, the Member for Health, Lands and Local Government, the Member for Commerce and Industry (all *ex officio* members) and such other persons as the Governor may appoint, whether holding public office or not, who are styled "Appointed members" or appointed as temporary members, with the Governor as President. There are at present four such Appointed members, two being Europeans, one Asian and one African.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor who is President, a Vice-President who is Speaker and 54 Members of whom eight are *ex officio* Members, 18 Nominated Members (who all accept the Government Whip on major issues of policy), 14 European Elected Members, six Asian Elected Members (four non-Muslim and two Muslim), one Arab Elected Member, six African Representative Members and one Arab Representative Member.

In the East African Central Legislative Assembly Kenya is represented by one Official and five Unofficial Members, of the latter two being European, one Asian, one Arab and one African.

By the Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Nyeri and various other places.

A General Election was held in 1952 for the constituencies established by the Legislative Council (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1951. This Ordinance defined the boundaries of the 14 European Electoral Areas, the four Indian non-Muslim Electoral Areas, the two Indian Muslim Electoral Areas and the one Arab Electoral Area. The six African Representative members were appointed from among the three names submitted by each of the electoral colleges set up in each of six areas of the Colony.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by non-African Local Authorities. There are now 24 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local legislation regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. The Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, enables District Councils in the settled areas to prepare schemes for organizing the local government of their area into a County Council.

In October, 1952, a State of Emergency was declared in Kenya. The Government then assumed special powers in order to maintain law and order in the face of a campaign of violence and barbarous atrocity engineered, principally amongst the Kikuyu, by the Mau Mau secret society. The Government, aided by the Security Forces, which include the Kenya Police Reserve and the Kikuyu Home Guard, as well as by United Kingdom troops under the command of General Sir George Erskine, is making strenuous efforts to stamp out terrorism. In May, 1953, Sir Frederick Crawford was appointed to the post of Deputy Governor in order to lighten the administrative burden falling upon the Governor as a result of the Emergency.

**Land Policy**

All land in Kenya falls into one of two categories:

(a) Crown lands.
(b) Native lands.

"Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

"Native lands" are permanently reserved for Africans in so far as the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of the land are concerned and all the rights enjoyed under native laws and custom are preserved.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township or native reserve, may be alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

**Taxation**

The forms of direct taxation are: income tax, which applies to all members of the community; personal tax, which applies to Europeans and Asians; poll tax, which applies to Africans, and hospital tax contribution, which applies to Europeans. Under the Income Tax Law generous personal allowances are given and the rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 1/50 in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases on a graduated scale to Shs. 11/– in the £ on incomes exceeding £50,000 per annum. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/- in the £. The maximum rate of the personal tax is £3 per annum and the amount of the hospital contribution is calculated on the amount of total income.

The other main forms of taxation are Customs and excise duties.

In 1952 in addition to the expenditure of £18,858,621 mentioned above, £5,352,251 was spent by the Development and Reconstruction Authority.

The Public Debt of Kenya at 31st December, 1952, was £26,286,881, made up as follows:

- Funded Debt: £22,395,600 (of which £6,696,091 was raised for E.A. Railways and Harbours Administration)
- Loans from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote: £3,642,595
- Total: £26,286,881

Currency

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also British Somaliland and Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/- and Shs. 1/- notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

The Development Programme is based on the recommendations contained in the Development Committee Report published in July, 1946, as modified by the recommendations contained in the Report of the Planning Committee published in 1951. The programme for the period 1946 to 1955, as revised by the Planning Committee, was £35,489,500. At the time of the Planning Committee Report the funds known to be available to carry out this Programme amounted to £30,926,500 of which £3,500,000 was to be obtained from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote (Colony's Block Allocation), £855,000 from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote (Inter-territorial and Central Research Allocations) and £16,500,000 by loan. The remainder was to come from Kenya revenue and from the proceeds of certain wartime taxes. The object of the Programme, which is now being reviewed by the Planning Committee in the light of the Emergency, is to use the natural resources of the country, including manpower, in a manner calculated to increase the national revenue and to raise the standard of living of the majority of the inhabitants in the shortest space of time. The Programme can be divided into the following parts:

| Development | £       | Per cent |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| I—Development of the Land | 11,419,400 | 32·1 |
| II—Development of Communications | 7,117,000 | 20·1 |
| III—Social Services | 9,125,600 | 25·7 |
| IV—Provision of facilities for Industry | 300,000 | 0·9 |
| V—General or Basic Developments | 7,527,500 | 21·2 |

Development of the Land

68·9% of the total allocation for this purpose will be spent on Agriculture and Veterinary Services and 24·9% on Water Development.

Development of Communications

78·6% of the total will be spent on Roads.

Social Services

21·1% of the total will be spent on Health and Hospital Services and 77·1% on Education.

General or Basic Developments

83% of the total is to be spent on Buildings.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation took over the operation of the Macalder Base Metal Mine, now renamed the "Macalder Nyanza Mines, Limited", in 1951 and production of copper concentrates has started. Soda ash ranked fifth in the list of the Colony's domestic exports. The production of kyanite and mullite continued to expand. New graphite and asbestos prospects showed promise and it is hoped that they will be developed on a commercial basis in the near future. Work on the Geological Survey continued and E.C.A. geologists reported that geological conditions in the Northern Province were not incompatible with the presence of oil.

Industrial development continued to make rapid progress. A new cigarette factory, two new flour mills, a brewery, a large brick and tile works, glassworks and a knitwear factory commenced to operate. An aluminium rolling mill, a cement factory, a factory for the manufacture of metal drums, a match factory, and a further brewery are nearing completion. Plans are under consideration for the setting up of a cotton textile mill and also factories for the manufacture of cotton blankets, bags from soft fibres, cement and mineral waters. The canning industry continues to make satisfactory progress. Proposals are under consideration for the establishment of an oil refinery at Mombasa.

Education (1952 figures)—African

The number of African Secondary and post-Secondary schools was 35, with an enrolment of 4,006 pupils. Fourteen of these institutions were Government schools with 2,127 pupils, and 21 were aided schools with 1,879 pupils. There was a total of 2,955 Primary and Intermediate schools, with 330,547 pupils. Of these, 151 were Government schools with 19,917 pupils; 1,555 schools with 207,254 pupils were aided and 1,249 schools with 103,376 pupils were unaided. Among these
schools were 48 teacher-training centres, six vocational schools and one teacher-training centre having 46 pupils who have passed the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate.

**Asian Education**

The number of Secondary schools had increased to 20 with a total enrolment of 4,301 pupils. There were nine Government schools with 3,240 pupils, seven aided Secondary schools with 868 pupils and four unaided schools with 193 pupils. The number of Primary schools was 90 with a total enrolment of 25,409 pupils. There were 17 Government Primary schools with 13,091 pupils, 65 aided schools with 11,821 pupils and eight unaided schools with 497 pupils. In these Primary schools there were 13,800 boys and 11,609 girls. There were also three Government teacher-training colleges with a total of 124 students of whom 60 were girls.

**European Education**

There were nine Secondary schools of which five had classes for Primary school children. The total number of Secondary pupils was 1,991. There were three Government schools with 1,425 pupils; one school with 155 pupils was aided and the five other schools with 411 pupils were unaided. Schools providing Primary education numbered 37, with a total enrolment of 5,075 pupils. There were twelve Government schools with 3,038 pupils, six aided schools with 409 pupils, and 19 unaided schools with 1,628 pupils.

**Arab and Other Races’ Education**

There was one Government Secondary school with 119 pupils, and ten Government Primary schools with 1,601 pupils. There was a total enrolment of 769 pupils in an aided Secondary school and three aided Primary schools.

**Higher Education**

The only institution for higher education in East Africa at present is Makerere College in Uganda where in 1952, 35 Kenya students were admitted to make a total of 107 students in all from Kenya attending the College.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses for higher education, usually in institutions overseas. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds drawn from the Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly to men at Makerere College, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for Asian teachers to enable them to take degree courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts in Secondary schools. The Government of India scholarships are among other sources of funds for assistance for students going overseas.

The total number of Kenya students in the United Kingdom at the end of 1952 was 393. This number is comprised of Africans 39 (34 with bursaries and scholarships), Arabs seven (five with bursaries and scholarships), Asians 187 (25 with bursaries and scholarships), Europeans 140 (34 with bursaries and scholarships), Goans 20 (2 with bursaries and scholarships). There were also 34 Kenya African students in India at the end of 1952.

Total Government recurrent expenditure on education in 1952 was £1,993,640, compared with £170,000 in 1935.

**Health**

Total expenditure by the Medical Department on Hospital Health Services in 1952 was £1,222,589 compared with £203,451 in 1935.

In 1952 beds available in Hospitals (including Maternity Homes) totalled 8,447 (Government 6,339, Local Authorities 466, Missions 1,163, Private 479). In-patients in Government Hospitals totalled 180,189, out-patients 1,154,847.

**Communications**

Nairobi (Eastleigh) is the main aerodrome used by international services. Internal scheduled services operated by E.A.A.C. are based on Nairobi West and operate services in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of aircraft-operating companies are based at Nairobi West. Air Safety and Aeradio Services are provided by the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. All air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the Air Transport Authority.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Aden, Ethiopia and Madagascar.

There are approximately 20,500 miles of road, varying in standard from good bitumen surfaced highways to tracks in the more remote areas which can be used only with difficulty by motor vehicles. The main roads, except during exceptional rains, are for the most part all-weather. They include part of the great North Road (Cape Town to Cairo) which passes through Kenya by way of Namanga on the Tanganyika border, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu and Busia on the Uganda border; the Mombasa–Nairobi road; the Mau Summit–Eldoret–Kitale road and the Nairobi–Nyeri–Nanyuki road.

(See also under “East Africa High Commission” for Railways and Harbours, Road, Air and Postal and Telegraph Services.)

**Broadcasting**

A broadcast transmitting station is operated at Nairobi by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, programme material being provided by the Information Service. Broadcasts to Africans, in Kikuyu and Swahili, from a studio in the Press Office, are transmitted throughout Kenya. Transmitters have a power of 5 kW. Local broadcasts in Swahili and Arabic are also given from a studio in Mombasa. The Press Office owns and maintains some 230 wireless sets, the majority of which are loaned to African coffee-shop owners. A wired service is also provided in the King George VI Hospital, Nairobi, and the Nairobi Prison. There are at present about 15,500 licensed wireless receiving sets in use.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. Many Africans in the Highlands
also own forest plantations. The estimated numbers in employment in other occupations in 1952 are shown in the following table:

| Non-African | African |
|-------------|---------|
| Agriculture and Forestry | 1,810 | 202,688 |
| Mining and Quarrying | 297 | 5,871 |
| Building and Construction | 2,479 | 15,582 |
| Commerce | 10,635 | 17,792 |
| Transport and Communications | 1,994 | 7,875 |
| Manufactures | 7,401 | 43,249 |
| Other Services | 2,467 | 39,914 |
| Public Services (including Government) | 14,060 | 101,568 |

In March, 1952, 13 employees' and four employers' unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total membership was 20,811.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are sisal, coffee, tea, wattle extract, cotton, maize, wheat and pyrethrum.

Beef production, dairying, sheep, pigs and poultry play an increasingly important rôle in the general agricultural policy of the Colony and considerable quantities of meat, butter, hides and skins, wool and bacon are produced annually.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony's timber supplies—softwoods such as *podo carpus* and pencil cedar as well as the hardwoods East African olive and camphor. Thinnings from exotic softwood and hardwood plantations, the bamboo forests up-country and the mangrove forests at the coast, provide well over 2,000,000 poles per annum.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and on Lakes Victoria and Rudolf, etc., and apart from seasonal shortages, an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The chief minerals are gold, kyanite, mullite, diatomite and asbestos. The production of soda ash and salt is collectively of more value than that of gold. Kyanite and mullite have now, it is estimated, also equalled gold production in value.

Other minerals worked are copper, lead and zinc; natural carbon dioxide gas of a high quality is also produced on a commercial scale. The total value of minerals won in 1952 was approximately £1,800,000.

There are some 80 main types of manufacturing and industrial activity, producing goods for local consumption and export. The main productions for export are aluminium holloware, bacon and pork products, base metals, boots and shoes, canned foodstuffs, cheese, cigarettes, diatomite products, dried milk, essential oil, gold, soda, hydrogenated oils, insecticides, kyanite and mullite, passion fruit juice and pulp, pyrites, pyrethrum extract, refractories, sisal products, tanned leather, wattle extract or bark, woollen blankets and textiles, pencil slats. Fancy leather goods and native curios are made by individual craftsmen for local consumption and export.
