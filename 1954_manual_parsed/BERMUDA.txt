BERMUDA

Situation and Area

The “Bermudas” or “Somers Islands” are situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, about 580 miles east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina.
Their total area is now about 21 square miles compared with 19 square miles prior to the establishment of naval and military Bases by the Government of the United States. Between 1941 and 1943 certain islands were joined, and other areas, previously water-covered, were filled in and now form a part of the territory occupied by the United States Bases, including a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

Population

The estimated civil population on the 31st December, 1952, was 38,954, of whom 15,093 were white and 23,861 coloured.

Geographical Features

The Bermudas consist of about 300 coralstone islands and islets, roughly in the form of a fishhook, along the southern rim of the oval plateau summit, about 22 miles from east to west and 14 miles from north to south, of a steep submarine volcanic mountain which is reputed to be between 14,000 and 15,000 feet in height. The ten principal islands are connected by bridges and form a chain about 22 miles long between its north-east and south-west extremities. These islands vary in width but the main island, which is about 14 miles long, has an average width of about 1 mile; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands and the areas reclaimed for the United States Bases aggregate about 4,280 acres.

Climate

The climate is generally mild and humid with a mean annual temperature of 70° F. and average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 90° F. and 47° F. respectively. The coldest and hottest months are February and August with mean temperatures of 62° F. and 80° F. respectively. The average annual rainfall is 58 inches. The climate shows very little variation throughout the Colony.

Principal Towns

The City of Hamilton, now the capital, with a population estimated at 3,000, is situated on the main island. The town of St. George on the island of St. George was formerly the capital of the Colony. Its population is estimated at 1,500.

History

The islands were discovered in 1515 by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, but the Spaniards took no steps to form a settlement and the islands were still entirely uninhabited when in 1609 Admiral Sir George Somers’ ship The Sea Venture was wrecked upon one of the sunken reefs while conveying a party of colonists to Virginia. The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I, but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called “The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands”, and thenceforward for a considerable time the islands bore that name.

Constitution

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled in 1684. Since then the Governors have been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of three official and four unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 5,066 electors, the elector’s qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240.

With the enactment of the Women’s Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

Taxation

There is no direct taxation. The revenue of the Colony is mostly raised from Customs duties. The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 11s. on every £100 of real estate and personal property, plus 3s. on every £100 for those freeholders receiving sewerage service. The corporation of St. George’s obtains its revenue in like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100. The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy rates, and under the Liquor Licence Act licensees pay a certain sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 460,002    | 452,072        |
| 1948 | 1,531,969  | 1,531,762      |
| 1949 | 1,885,547  | 1,706,587      |
| 1950 | 2,009,463  | 1,969,022      |
| 1951 | 2,368,262  | 2,076,796      |
| 1952 | 2,583,674  | 2,646,692      |

In 1952 £1,863,375 of revenue was derived from Customs duties.

Currency

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £1,078,395 were in circulation on 31st December, 1952.

Development

The clearance of dead cedar trees along the roadsides to a depth of 50 feet and the re-planting under the Reafforestation (Compulsory Powers) Act, 1952, of the cleared areas with suitable trees and shrubs began in mid-June of that year and is progressing satisfactorily. The Bermuda Government appropriated £25,000 from revenue for the first half year of operation of this development plan.

The discovery towards the end of 1952 of “Tristera” disease in some of the citrus groves of Florida, whence came most of the citrus stock in Bermuda, caused a severe setback to the “grow more” citrus campaign which was initiated in 1944 because, although the disease
has not yet manifested itself in Bermuda, the local growers are naturally concerned for the future of this young industry.

The Department of Public Works made good progress in the construction of a new Passenger Terminal Building at Kindley Airfield. The first section was completed and in use by April 1952 and the next two sections were ready for use early in 1953. The estimated total cost of this project, which is chargeable to the Reserve Fund, is £184,500, of which £88,522 was spent in 1952.

The Corporation of Hamilton also made good progress with the substitution of a large modern two-storey covered wharf for an old smaller one on Hamilton Harbour. The total cost is estimated at £60,000, payable out of Corporation revenue. About half the work was done in 1952 and the remainder was expected to be completed before the end of 1953.

**Education**

| Type of Course          | No. of Courses | No. of pupils |
|-------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Primary                 | 37            | 6,926        |
| Secondary               | 10            | 892          |
| Technical and Vocational| 5             | 216          |
| Post-Secondary          | nil           | nil          |

*Note.—It is considered advisable to give the number of courses rather than the number of institutions, as one institution may provide more than one type of course.*

The approximate number of Bermudian students attending schools, colleges and universities in the United Kingdom is 29 and in Canada and the United States, 550.

Government expenditure on education in 1952 was £348,578, compared with £21,379 in 1927 and £36,546 in 1937.

**Libraries, Museums, Etc.**

The Bermuda Library, with adult and children's departments in Hamilton, has a branch in St. George and a distribution service to the schools of the Colony.

The Bermuda Government Aquarium with adjoining live zoological collection has a museum of local natural history and other exhibits. The Bermuda Historical Society also has museums in Hamilton and St. George containing items of local historical interest.

**Health**

The level of health in the Colony is high and Government services are chiefly engaged in preventive measures. The Public Health Department is responsible for the inspection of milk and meat, garbage collection and disposal, rat control, mosquito control, etc. It is also responsible for pre-natal and pre-school health services.

The only hospitals are the King Edward VII Isolation Hospital and a Mental Hospital. The former is privately run, but receives an annual Government grant-in-aid, amounting in 1953 to £125,000. The Mental Hospital is attended by Government Medical Officers and Health Officers. There is no public hospital or Government medical scheme.

During 1952 total government expenditure on Health Services was £240,664 compared with £47,890 in 1935.

**Communications**

Pan American Airways and Colonial Airlines maintain regular services between Bermuda and the United States of America. B.O.A.C. operates weekly services in both directions between Bermuda and New York thrice, London twice, Bahamas and Jamaica once and Barbados and Trinidad once. Trans-Canada Airlines call at Bermuda in each direction on their weekly service between Montreal, Barbados and Trinidad. They also operate a service twice weekly between Bermuda, Toronto and Montreal. Avianca calls at Bermuda once a week both ways between Bogota, Barranquilla and the Azores, Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Frankfurt and Hamburg. Iberia calls at Bermuda similarly between Madrid, Lisbon, the Azores and Havana and Mexico City, and once a week eastbound only between Caracas, Puerto Rico and the Azores and Madrid. Cubana calls at Bermuda once a week both ways between Havana, the Azores, Lisbon and Madrid. All commercial planes use Bermuda Air Terminal at Kindley Field.

The Bermuda Government abandoned the railway late in 1947.

The Colony has 116½ miles of preponderantly well-surfaced road, of which 8½ miles are in Hamilton and 4½ miles in St. George.

The Furness Bermuda Line's ship Q.T.E.V. *Queen of Bermuda* maintains a weekly service between Bermuda and the United States and their *Ocean Monarch* operates, mostly as a cruise ship, between Bermuda, the United States, Bahamas, Cuba and the Saguenay River in Canada.

The Pacific Steam Navigation Company's passenger liner *Reina del Pacifico* calls at Bermuda four times annually in both directions on its regular service between the U.K. and South America and in the autumn operates a single cruise from the U.K. to the West Indies calling at Bermuda in both directions. The same company's "S" freighters with accommodation for a few passengers call at Bermuda approximately twice monthly outbound from the U.K. to South American west coast ports. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's *Loch* steamers call at Bermuda approximately once a month outbound from the U.K. to North American west coast ports and their "E" ships visit the Colony outbound from the U.K. to Caribbean ports. Occasionally inbound freighters of this Company call at Bermuda to convey cargoes of used British motor cars to the U.K. The Montreal, Australia and New Zealand Line's inbound steamers from Australia and New Zealand to the U.K. call at Bermuda about four times a year to discharge refrigerated meat and dairy produce. Intermediate Cunard passenger liners call at Bermuda occasionally between U.K. and United States ports. Cargo and passenger liners of Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships, Limited, visit Bermuda about thrice monthly in summer and twice monthly in winter in both directions between Canadian, British West Indies and British Guiana ports. The Alcoa Line operates fortnightly cargo and passenger services from Canadian to West Indies, and from United States to Venezuelan and West Indies ports, calling at Bermuda outbound only.

**Broadcasting**

A broadcasting station (Z.B.M.) operated by the Bermuda Broadcasting Company, Limited, on two wavelengths, has a transmitting power of 250 watts. Radio licences are not required.

The majority of these visitors are Americans. In 1952 4,013 came from Canada, 1,569 from the West Indies. Most visitors arrive and leave by air.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The only marketing scheme in operation in Bermuda is the "Planned Production and Marketing Scheme" introduced in 1949 to assist the growers of vegetables to find a suitable outlet for their produce. The growers taking part in the scheme contract to grow a specified acreage of certain vegetable crops. The Department of Agriculture agrees to purchase any produce from the acreage specified at guaranteed minimum prices. In addition to the produce grown on contract the Government Wholesale Agricultural Marketing Centre buys other vegetables, citrus fruit and bananas. This scheme has undoubtedly assisted the farming community as more farmers are applying to join. During 1952 purchases of agricultural produce at the Wholesale Marketing Centre amounted to £38,644. Receipts from the resale of this produce exceeded £43,064.
