**MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS**

Various islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory or under British protection but are not included in any colony or separate protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants.
The Territories of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland in southern Africa are administered by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations through a High Commissioner appointed by the Queen. The High Commissioner also holds the office of High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in the Union of South Africa. He is the sole legislative authority for these Territories and is responsible to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in much the same way as a Colonial Governor is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Each Territory is administered by a Resident Commissioner, responsible to the High Commissioner, and is divided into administrative districts in charge of District Commissioners.

Information about these Territories will be found in *The Commonwealth Relations Office List*. This brief note, and the following Civil Establishment list showing heads and deputy heads of departments and analogous appointments, have been included in *The Colonial Office List* 1954 because the Territories' Services are interchangeable with the Colonial Service. Biographical notes are included in the Record of Services section.
