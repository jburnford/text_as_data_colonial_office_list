FEDERATION OF MALAYA

Area

The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,690 square miles. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang and the smallest is the State of Perlis.
Population

The total estimated population at 30th June, 1953, was 5,705,952:

| Group                  | Population |
|------------------------|------------|
| Malaysians              | 2,803,863  |
| Chinese                | 2,152,906  |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 665,503    |
| Europeans              | 14,430     |
| Eurasians              | 11,851     |
| Others                 | 57,399     |
| **Total**              | **5,705,952** |

The Chinese predominate in the south-western States and in Penang, the commercial and industrial area, whereas there is a bigger percentage of Malaysians in the north and east and in Malacca.

New citizenship legislation which came into force on 15th September, 1952, confers citizenship by operation of law on all subjects of the rulers of the States and certain categories of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in the Federation. It is estimated that the number of persons who were citizens by operation of law at 30th June, 1953, was 4,139,000:

| Group                  | Population |
|------------------------|------------|
| Malaysians              | 2,727,000  |
| Chinese                | 1,157,000  |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 222,000    |
| Others                 | 33,000     |
| **Total**              | **4,139,000** |

As a general rule for non-Malays who are not Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies the qualification necessary for automatic citizenship and State nationality is to have been born in the Federation and to have had one parent born there also. Non-Malays without this qualification may, under certain conditions, acquire citizenship by registration or naturalization. The policy behind the legislation is to make citizenship available (i) by operation of law to anyone who by birth can be assumed to be sufficiently assimilated to the life and loyalty of the country; and (ii) by registration or naturalization to others who have reasonable qualifications to be regarded as Malaysians.

Geographical Features

The Federation occupies the southern section of the Kra Peninsula, which protrudes at the south-eastern corner of Asia between India and China. It is divided by mountain ranges, the main trend of which is north and south. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country, while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains, which are mainly alluvial, and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80% of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp. The coastline of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west lies a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat, with infrequent indentations of bays. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand. Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands (rising to over 2,000 feet) off the north Kedah coast, and off the east coast, Tioman and other scattered islands.

The two principal rivers are the Perak and the Pahang, the latter some 200 miles long. It springs in the main range of mountains (highest Gunung Tahan, 7,000 feet). This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory south of the Himalayas.

That part of the country free from forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas, as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other areas, particularly the Kinta Valley, Perak, have been mined for tin.

Climate

The principal features of the climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons, which correspond roughly with the summer and winter of northern latitudes. The months between these two seasons are the wettest months over most parts of Malaya. Coastal districts, however, have their own peculiar rainy seasons. Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year. Jelebu in Negri Sembilan is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches, and Maxwell's Hill the wettest, with 198 inches a year.

The highest temperature recorded in the plains during 1952 was 99° and the lowest 64°. The average maximum is rather less than 90° and the average minimum about 70°. At Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 80° and 36° and at Fraser's Hill 82° and 53°. The nights are reasonably cool everywhere and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity, somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not possible at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate is desirable for Europeans if health is to be maintained.

History

In 1786 Francis Light obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795 during the Napoleonic wars, but was handed back to the Dutch in 1814. The loss of Malacca caused Stamford Raffles to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Tumasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. Raffles obtained a concession from the representative of the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. As a free port Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands in 1824 when, by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London, Malaya was recognized as a British sphere of influence. The Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca and Singapore which at first came under the India Office, passed to the control of the Colonial Office in 1867. The extension of British authority into the Peninsula was hastened by unsettled conditions in the Malay States which had deteriorated in some cases into civil war and disorder. In 1873 the new Governor of the Straits Settlements came out with authority for
more active intervention. The first result was the Treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern States by the Treaty of Bangkok. In 1910 agreements were concluded with Kelantan and Trengganu (the latter amended in 1919) in 1923 with Kedah and in 1930 with Perlis. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were similar in their main features. The Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in turn guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each State a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the Rulers agreed to follow in all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The foundations of good government and friendly relations laid by such early Residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories in the Commonwealth.

In the early years of the century Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a Federation (the Federated Malay States) with a Resident-General as chief executive officer, and a system of centralized government was inaugurated. This system lasted in varying forms until 1932, when there was a measure of decentralization by which legislative powers were to some extent restored to the States and the authority of the Rulers and Residents was reinforced.

Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt stop during the Japanese occupation from December 1941 to August 1945. On the liberation of the country, the Government of the Malayan Union was established, but this administrative system met with strong objections by the Malays and on the 1st February, 1948, a new Constitution came into force. The new Constitution allowed each State and Settlement to retain its individuality under a strong central government.

**Constitution**

The Federation of Malaya which comprises the nine Malay states of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu and the two British Settlements of Penang and Malacca, was constituted on 1st February, 1948, by:

(a) the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, between His Majesty King George VI and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu;

(b) the State Agreements between His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers; and

(c) the Federation of Malaya Order in Council, 1948.

The Federation of Malaya Agreement, as from time to time amended, provides for an Executive Council of 20 members, presided over by the High Commissioner, and for a Legislative Council of 75 members presided over by a Speaker. Of the 75 Councillors, 50 are unofficial, representing various economic, commercial, professional and cultural interests, nine are Presidents of the Councils of State in the States, two represent the Settlement Councils of Penang and Malacca, three are *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary) and 12 are Members of the Federal Government, each responsible for certain departments and functions. Their "Portfolios" are Home Affairs, Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, Health, Education, Industrial and Social Relations, Lands, Mines and Communications, Works, Railways and Ports, Chinese Affairs, Defence and Local Government, Housing and Town Planning.

The Federation Agreement also established a Conference of Rulers consisting of the Rulers of all the Malay States. The Conference meets the High Commissioner at least three times a year.

The State Agreements provide for the establishment of a State Executive Council and a Council of State in each State. The Council of State is the legislative body. In each of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca there is a Nominated Council and a Settlement Council. The Settlement Council, as the local legislative body, corresponds to the Council of State in a Malay State.

The Federation Agreement records the desire of His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers that progress be made towards self-government, and their agreement that, as a first step to this end, legislation shall be introduced as soon as circumstances permit for the election of members to the various legislatures established under the Agreement.

**Emergency**

Since June 1948 a state of Emergency has existed in Malaya. Special powers were assumed by the Government in that month to preserve law and order in the face of outbreaks of violence perpetrated by the Malayan Communist Party. Communist terrorists have since then carried out guerrilla operations from jungle bases in an attempt, by ambush, murder and the destruction of property, to impose their will on the Malayan people. They have not succeeded in doing this, but they have caused a great deal of suffering to innocent people. The Government, with the assistance of its locally raised (and largely voluntary) Security Forces, as well as British and Commonwealth troops, and with the support of the large majority of the people of Malaya, has made great efforts to put down terrorism. After the murder in October 1951 of Sir Henry Gurney, the late High Commissioner and a devoted servant of the people of Malaya, General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed High Commissioner and Director of Operations and Mr. D. C. (now Sir Donald) MacGillivray, Deputy High Commissioner. These appointments were the first steps in a widespread reorganization of the Security Forces and other Government machinery. By October 1952 terrorist activity was on the decline and the growing confidence of the people was demonstrated by the increasing flow of information about the terrorists given to the authorities.

The political and social policies of the Government are complementary to the arduous work of the Security Forces in countering the Emergency. The resettlement programme has brought more than half a million former "squatters", who had been easy prey for the terrorists, into the relative security of New Villages where they are given land, social services and a chance to run their own affairs. Government is very conscious of the need to help these people and others like them to play a fuller and happier part in the life of the
Malayan community which must be the foundation of a Malayan nation. The Emergency has not been allowed to bring political progress to a standstill and the directive given to Sir Gerald Templer on his appointment as High Commissioner in February 1952 reaffirmed the determination of Her Majesty's Government to see law and order restored in Malaya, and to help the evolution out of her diverse races of a united nation fit for self-government.

Land Policy

The Torrens system of registration of title to land is in force in the Federation, except in the Settlements of Penang and Malacca where it is intended to introduce registration of title as soon as is practicable. Most alienated land is held in perpetuity on payment of an annual rent to Government. It is now the usual practice, however, to alienate town land on 99-year leases. Malay Reservations have been created within which land may not be alienated to non-Malays. State land, not lying within Malay Reservations, and Crown land may be alienated to Federal citizens and non-Federal citizens.

Taxation

The most important form of taxation is indirect by means of export duties on rubber and tin, and import duties on tobacco, beers, spirits, petrol and textiles. The main form of direct taxation is income tax. All persons not resident in the Federation are chargeable at a flat rate of 20% which is being raised in 1954 to 30%. There is provision for relief for a non-resident British subject or a non-resident British protected person. In the case of individuals resident in the Federation, $3,000 is deductible from assessable income if the individual is unmarried. A further allowance of $2,000 is made to a married man. Allowances are also made in respect of children up to nine in number, for life assurance premiums paid, and for obligatory or contractual contributions to approved pension or provident funds. The rate of tax on the chargeable income remaining after the above-mentioned allowances have been made varies from 3% on the first $500 to 30% on chargeable income in excess of $50,000. The rate of tax chargeable on the income of companies was raised to 30% in 1951. A double taxation relief arrangement with the United Kingdom is in operation.

The nine State and two Settlement Governments have their own budgets for local administration which are balanced by allocations from Federal funds. The figures given above represent the totals of Federal, State and Settlement revenue and expenditure in each year. The figures of revenue for 1949, 1950 and 1952 include contributions from Her Majesty's Government in aid of defence expenditure of £42,857,143 (£5 million), £25,714,286 (£3 million) and £3,385,714 (£395,000) respectively.

The Federation of Malaya's share of the Straits Settlements Public Debt is $14,849,629.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is exclusive legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency notes of denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, and $1 issued by:

Silver coins ceased to be legal tender from 31st December, 1952.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The nominal circulation on 31st December, 1952, was:

- Notes $786,797,438·86, coins $25,263,659·33.

Development Plans

A six-year Draft Development Plan was prepared in 1950 and it is intended that its revision should be undertaken as soon as circumstances...
permit. The latest estimates of the cost of schemes in the Development Plan show expenditure up to 1957 of the following order:

|                | $ million | Per cent. |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Basic Services | 445       | 53·3      |
| Social Services| 246       | 29·4      |
| Productive Services | 144 | 17·3      |
| Total          | 835       | 100·0     |

**Basic Services.**—26·5% of the total expenditure will be devoted to the development of electricity, 12·0% to railways and 4·1% to water supplies.

**Social Services.**—11·3% of the total expenditure (up to 1952) will be spent on the resettlement of squatters in New Villages, 7·3% on education and 7·0% on housing.

**Productive Services.**—10·4% of the total expenditure will be allocated to the Rural and Industrial Development Authority for projects of all kinds directed towards the development of rural areas, and 4·5% on drainage and irrigation works.

The sources of funds are:

(a) the Malayan allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, $42·8 million.

(b) the Colonial Development Corporation, which so far has provided about $60·7 million towards the development of electric power;

(c) Federation of Malaya Government Loans, $200 million;

(d) Revenue; and

(e) other sources not yet explored.

**Education**

The University of Malaya, serving the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, has faculties of Arts, Science and Medicine. In the 1952-53 session there were 553 students from the Federation. The Technical College, Kuala Lumpur, had 239 students, and the Agricultural College, Serdang, 46 students. Government awards scholarships and bursaries for higher education, tenable at the University of Malaya or in the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand. There are 300 students being trained as teachers at the Malayan Teachers' Training College, Kirkby, Lancashire, and in addition there are over 900 Malayan students at Universities and centres of higher learning overseas. In 1952 there were 133,924 pupils in 312 English Schools (schools for mixed races where the medium of instruction is English) 315,992 pupils in 1,965 Malay Schools, 240,154 pupils in 1,203 Chinese Schools and 39,389 pupils in 854 Indian Schools. With Government aid, Adult Education Associations have been formed in all States and Settlements. At the end of 1952 these had organized 1,160 classes in vernacular literacy and English, with about 31,000 adult students enrolled. Government grants to the Association in that year totalled $248,571.

Expenditure on Educational Services in 1952 was about $69,857,143 of which $550,714 was contributed by the United Kingdom under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.

**Libraries, Museums, Etc.**

There are museums in Kuala Lumpur and in Taiping, both of which have libraries, and new museums are being established in Malacca and Seremban. Under the Preservation of Books Ordinance, 1950, three copies of all publications printed in the Federation are required to be sent to the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur. The Malayan Historical Society, founded in 1953, is producing district and town histories and recording much information which would otherwise be lost. Archaeological and anthropological research is conducted from the National Museum.

**Health**

In 1952 Government maintained 70 hospitals with 12,983 beds; general 8,387, maternity 1,175 and infectious—including pulmonary tuberculosis—3,421. In addition, Government maintains four institutions with 3,454 beds for the treatment of leprosy and two mental hospitals of 4,200 beds. At Government hospitals the total number of in-patients treated was 241,619 (general 231,916, mental 5,883, and leprosy 3,820). On rubber estates there are 133 hospitals maintained privately with 5,768 beds; 83,158 in-patients were admitted during 1952. Treatment of the rural population is carried out through dispensaries (including mobile road and river boat units) and infant welfare centres. These number 150, 73, 16 and 336 respectively, and the total number of new cases treated was 3,682,805.

The total expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1952 was $44,079,079 compared with $16,623,487 in 1947. A further $650,881 was spent on the emergency expansion of health services in new villages.

The principal diseases treated in Government hospitals throughout the Federation were malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, dysentery, diarrhoea and enteritis, pneumonia, bronchitis, beriberi, venereal diseases, enteric fever.

The main anti-malarial measures in towns and villages are sub-soil drainage by permanent works, oiling and D.D.T. spraying of houses. Water supplies are treated according to modern methods, sanitation is either water-borne or by bucket system of removal in all the towns.

**Communications**

There are civil customs aerodromes at Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Penang, Alor Star, Kota Bharu, Kuantan and Malacca and these have all necessary Air Traffic Control and passenger facilities. In addition 15 smaller landing grounds are used by scheduled air services and the total number maintained for commercial, military and private use is 58.

Malayan Airways operate the main internal routes with D.C.3 aeroplanes, including 37 services a week between the capitals of the Federation and Singapore, which provide connexion with trunk routes. The Government-owned Federation Air Service with Beaver aeroplanes connects smaller towns to the main line. Routes to Indonesia, Burma, Thailand and French Indo-China are operated by Malayan Airways, Union of Burma Airways or Thai Airways.

The route mileage of the Malayan Railway open to traffic in 1952 was 912. The main line runs from Singapore 488 miles north-westwards to Prai (opposite Penang Island); there are short branches to the west coast, and a longer branch (99 miles) from Bukit Mertajam northwards to the Thailand frontier at Padang Besar; the east coast line runs from Gemas (137 miles from Singapore) northwards 327 miles to Tumpat on the north-east coast of the peninsula, but 200 miles of track here were removed by the Japanese. The restoration of this gap, whilst continuing from the north had been interrupted from the south since 1948 by communist terrorist activity:
1952 the improving situation enabled the work to be resumed and by the end of the year construction railheads were within 43 miles of each other.

The Malayan Railway connects with the Thailand Railway at Padang Besar and Sungei Golok.

Passenger journeys in 1952 totalled 6,212,093 and paying goods tonnage 1,996,083. Gross revenue reached the record figure of $55.4 million; total working expenditure was $52.7 million.

The Public Works Department maintains about 6,314 miles of public road, of which 4,097 miles is metalled surface, grouted or sealed with bitumen, 356 metalled surface waterbound, 877 hard surface waterbound, 706 earth surface, 257 hard surface bitumen sealed, and 21 concrete surface.

The principal ports in the Federation are Penang and Port Swettenham; the numbers and net registered tonnages of ships of 75 tons and over which entered and cleared thereat during 1952 were:

| Port          | Entered | Cleared |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Penang        | 1,894   | 1,883   |
| Port Swettenham | 1,007   | 1,006   |

Tonnages of cargo (in "freight" tons) discharged and loaded, including cargo from and to ships of 75 tons and under were:

| Port          | Tonnage |
|---------------|---------|
| Penang        | 1,695,966 |
| Port Swettenham | 1,153,601 |

Navigational aids around the 800-mile coast are maintained by the Marine Department.

Services to and from the United Kingdom are provided by the main shipping companies on the Far Eastern service. Local companies provide coastal services to ports in South-East Asia.

Broadcasting

The Department of Broadcasting is pan-Malayan. It maintains stations of "Radio Malaya" at Kuala Lumpur (two 10 kW. medium wave transmitters, on 5 kW. shortwave), Penang (two 2 kW. medium wave), and Malacca (one 50 watt medium wave) but much of the Federation is served by "Radio Malaya," Singapore. There were 84,505 licence holders in the Federation on 31st December, 1952, including 11,017 subscribers to Rediffusion (Malaya) Limited. Over 1,100 schools in the Federation are equipped with receivers for the reception of school broadcasts from Radio Malaya. Special rural broadcasts in Malay, Tamil, Hakka, Cantonese and Mandarin are heard on about 1,000 community receivers installed in rural areas by the Government and on receivers installed on several hundred mines and estates for the benefit of the workers.

Principal Occupations

Apart from the 200,000-250,000 who are self-employed in peasant agriculture (including rubber smallholdings) or fishing, the larger part of the working population is engaged directly or indirectly in the rubber industry.

| Occupation                          | Number |
|-------------------------------------|--------|
| Rubber plantations and estates      | 290,364 |
| Coconut, oil-palm and tea plantations| 27,930  |
| Tin industry                        | 40,346  |

There are 235 registered trade unions of employers and employees, consisting of 133 Civil Servants' Unions, 94 Industrial Workers' Unions and eight Employers' Unions. Civil Servants' Unions have 40,847 members who are drawn from all races and from 23 different types of Government occupations. Industrial Workers' Unions have 73,240 members drawn from about 28 different categories of employment. The eight Employers' Unions have a membership of 998, of whom the Rubber and Tin Employers' Unions are the most important. The total membership is 115,085. An approximate break-down by races is 67% Indians, 17% Chinese, 13% Malays and 3% others.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are rubber, rice, oil palm, coconuts, pineapples and tea. There are 3½ million acres of land under rubber, more than half the area under all agricultural crops. Rubber small-holdings cover 1½ million acres. Total production in 1952 was 582,646 tons.

The livestock population numbers: cattle, including buffaloes 502,000, goats 271,000, sheep 25,000, swine 290,000, equines 700.

The bulk of the commercial timber of Malaya is produced by the Dipterocarapaceae, but much timber is produced which is not at present of commercial value. The outturn of logs in 1952 was 1,000,000 tons of 50 cubic feet round measure, all of which were sawn locally. There is a flourishing export trade in graded sawn timber mainly to the United Kingdom and Australia, which totalled 42,000 tons in 1952; 33,000 tons of ungraded timber were exported, mainly to Aden and the Persian Gulf.

The total production of fish per annum is now of the order of 170,000 tons, with a retail value of $273,600,000. Of this total, approximately 160,000 tons is produced in the Federation and 10,000 tons is landed in Singapore; 25,000 tons is from fresh water sources, mostly fishpond culture. $2,100,000 worth of the total fish production is used as manure and animal fodder. Approximately 16,000 tons of dried fish is produced in the Federation and exported through Singapore all over Asia, the bulk of it to Indonesia. This represents about twice the weight in wet fish. The mechanization of the fishing industry has been rapid since the war and landings have increased by over 60% in the last eight years.

Mineral production during 1952 was as follows:

| Mineral         | Production |
|-----------------|------------|
| Tin concentrates| 75,783 tons |
| Iron ore        | 1,055,506 tons |
| Coal            | 314,922 tons |
| Gold            | 19,806 oz. (troy) |
| Bauxite         | 21,796 tons |
| Ilmenite        | 21,498 tons |
| Columbite       | 47 tons |
| Wolfram         | 44 tons |
| Scheelite       | 24 tons |
| China clay      | 1,128 tons |

The Federation of Malaya was responsible for one-third of the world's total production of tin concentrates and the value of her exports of tin metal during 1952 was $299 million; other mineral exports were valued at $28,190,130.

Manufactures include tyres and tubes, bricks (over 54,000 in 1952), canvas/rubber and other footwear and soap (3,838 tons in 1952).

* Excluding bullion, specie and parcel post and trade between the Territories.

In 1947, 19·3% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 24·7% from other Commonwealth countries, 19·2% from Indonesia, and 36·8% from other foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were, 21·3%, 19·3%, 23·3% and 36·1%.

In 1947, 16·1% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 19·7% to other Commonwealth countries, 33·9% to U.S.A., and 30·3% to other foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 20·6%, 15·9%, 16·8%, and 46·7%.

About 40% of the Federation's import and export trade is channelled through Singapore. An increasing proportion, however, particularly of imports, is being channelled through Federation ports. Trade with the United Kingdom has increased reflecting the improved supply position from that source. Similarly Commonwealth imports (particularly from Australia) have been increasing slowly. Imports from neighbouring territories have fallen to more normal levels from the peak of 1950-51 when rubber and tin were booming. As a result of improved availabilities from soft currency sources of supply imports from Canada and the U.S.A. have declined slightly.

The United States, however, has been one of the largest customers, although exports have declined since the high figures after the war resulting from heavy purchases of rubber and tin. Exports to the U.K. are now at about the same level as to the U.S.A. having been lower immediately after the war. Exports to neighbouring territories have fluctuated with changing conditions, both economic and political, and appear to be declining. To Japan, however, they are increasing and the balance of trade has turned sharply so that exports are nearly double imports.

Principal Exports by Volume and Value *

| Export Item | 1947 | 1951 | 1952 |
|-------------|------|------|------|
| Rubber      | 000 tons | 953 | 1,155 | 910 |

* Excluding trade between the territories.

The chief imports are textiles, cement, foodstuffs, building materials, manufactured goods, chemicals, machinery, paper, motor fuel, rubber and copra.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

On 31st December, 1952, there were 1,567 co-operative societies with 200,895 members and working capital of $18,920,295 (Straits Settlements), or approximately £2,207,363.

Marketing and processing societies amongst smallholders increased from 42 to 99. The majority of these were rubber marketing co-operative societies, fishing and marketing societies, and rice milling co-operative societies.
