NIGERIA

Area

Of the total area of 373,250 square miles, the Colony comprises 1,381 and the Protectorate 371,869 (including 34,081 in the Cameroons Trust Territory). The country is divided into three Regions whose areas are: Northern 281,782, Eastern 46,065, Western 45,403 square miles.

Population

A census of the country was carried out in three stages: the Northern Region in July 1952, the Western Region in December 1952 and the Eastern Region in June 1953. The population of Nigeria based on preliminary figures is just over 31 million: 17 million in the Northern Region, nearly 8 million in the Eastern Region and six and one-half million in the Western Region. The total non-African population is almost 16,000. The sizes of the main tribal groups are estimated as follows: Fulani 9.6%, Hausa 17.5%, Yoruba 14.4%, Ibo 16% (1931). Apart from that for the Ibos, which is a 1931 estimate, these percentages are based on the known figures for each group within the Region it mainly inhabits and exclude minorities living in other Regions.

More accurate figures await the detailed analysis of the census. Half the people in the Northern Region are Hausa or Fulani while 70% of the population in the Western Region is Yoruba. In 1931 it was estimated that 62% of the population in the Eastern Region was Ibo. Population is densest between Lagos and Ibadan in the West and around Kano in the North.

Geographical Features

There are four main zones, each stretching across the country from east to west and corresponding closely to the annual rainfall. This falls from as much as 200 inches in the south-east to as little as 20 inches in the north. The four zones are:

(i) A belt of creeks and mangrove swamps along the coast, which includes the Niger delta. It extends anything from 10 to 60 miles inland.

(ii) A well-watered belt of dense tropical forest from 50 to 100 miles wide. It is rich in oil palms and cacao.

(iii) A belt of park-like land with savannahs of high grass, and largely uninhabited because of tsetse-fly.

(iv) A vast undulating plateau about 2,000 feet high, with occasional hills of granite and sandstone sometimes rising to over 5,000 feet. The northern half of this is free of tsetse-fly, and carries a heavy stock of nomadic cattle. This area also produces groundnuts and cotton.

The Cameroons Mountain (13,350 ft.) is a volcano, and was last active in 1922. There are 2,600 square miles of land over 5,000 feet and 193,000 square miles over 1,000 feet. The main rivers (with length in Nigeria) are as follows: Niger, 730 miles; Benue, 495 miles; Sokoto, 390 miles; Kaduna, 340 miles; Cross, 335 miles and Dongola, 330 miles.

Lake Chad, the only important lake, has an area of 1,850 square miles. There are 119,431 square miles of forest (constituting 31.9% of the total area of the country) and 29,114 square miles of forest Reserve.

Climate

There is a dry season, roughly from November to April and a rainy season, which is longer in the south than the north and later in the east than the west. The wettest months in the north are August and September and in the south, June, July and August. Average annual rainfalls are: Kaduna, 2,000 feet above sea level, 52 inches; Enugu, 600 feet above sea level, 71 inches; Ibadan, 600 feet above sea level, 48 inches. The annual average temperature is everywhere about 80°. In the south the temperature varies very little; in the north it may rise as high as 110° but the nights are cool.

Principal Towns

Lagos, with a population of 272,000, is the capital. The Regional capitals are Kaduna (Northern), Ibadan (Western), Enugu (Eastern) with populations of 51,635, 459,196 and 63,000 respectively. Nearly all the large towns are in the Western Region where there are at least ten towns of over 50,000 population. In the north, Kano has a population of 130,173. In the East, Onitsha, Aba and Enugu have more than 50,000.

History

As far back as the seventeenth century British traders had mercantile depôts on the mouths of the Niger and adjacent rivers and creeks, trade...
until the nineteenth century being mainly in slaves. Journeys were not undertaken into the interior, however, until the era of exploration which began with the formation in London of an African Association in 1788. The Association directed its attention to solving the mystery of the "Great River" which was known to flow through much of West Africa. Thanks to the journeys of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, it was demonstrated in 1830 that the many rivers flowing into the Bight of Benin were, in fact, the delta of the Niger.

Under the inspiration of MacGregor Laird and others, efforts then began to use the Niger as a commercial highway into the interior. They were not on the whole successful, but British and other firms maintained stations in the delta chiefly to trade for palm oil. The energy and vision of Sir George Goldie led to an amalgamation of the British firms into a single company, and the new company developed its trade to such effect that opposing interests were all bought out. At the Berlin conference in 1885 the British claim to a sphere of influence over the Niger districts was accordingly recognized.

The British company, now given a charter and re-named the Royal Niger Company, proceeded to extend its influence into the interior by treaties with local rulers. There was friction with French interests but in 1898 the British and French Governments signed a convention regulating boundaries. In 1900 the administrative rights and powers of the Royal Niger Company were taken over by the Crown.

Until 1914 the country was administered in two parts—the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. The Colony comprised a small area around Lagos which had been annexed in 1862 as a base for operations against the slave trade. From 1900 to 1903 the authorities in Northern Nigeria were engaged in bringing under control the powerful emirates of the Hausa states and the Kanuri kingdom of Bornu which maintained large standing armies used for slave raiding.

In 1914 Northern and Southern Nigeria were amalgamated to form a Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. At the end of the 1914-18 war part of the adjacent territory of the German Cameroons (which had been occupied by Anglo-French forces) was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as part of Nigeria. Following the formation of the United Nations the Cameroons became a Trusteeship Territory.

**Constitution**

Under a constitution introduced in June 1951 there is a Central Council of Ministers presided over by the Governor and comprising six *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary, the Lieutenant-Governors of the three Regions, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary) and 12 Ministers, four from each Region; and there is the House of Representatives comprising in addition to the President, 148 members—68 from the Northern Region, 34 each from the Western and Eastern Regions, six *ex officio* members and six members appointed by the Governor to represent interests or communities not otherwise adequately represented. In the Regions, there are Regional Executive Councils presided over by the Lieutenant-Governor of each Region, and comprising 6-9 Regional Ministers (7-9 in the East, to include one from the Southern Cameroons), three *ex officio* members and not more than two other official members. The Regional Legislatures consist of a House of Assembly in the East, and a House of Chiefs and a House of Assembly in the North and West. The Northern House of Chiefs comprises a President, three official members, all first-class chiefs, 37 other chiefs and the Adviser on Moslem Law (who has no vote). The Northern House of Assembly comprises a President, 90 elected members, four official members and ten special members. The Western House of Chiefs comprises a President, three official members, and not more than 50 chiefs. The Western House of Assembly comprises a President, 80 elected members, four official members and three special members. The Eastern House of Assembly comprises a President, 80 elected members, five official members and three special members.

Except in Lagos, where elections to the Western House of Assembly are direct, elections to the Regional Houses of Assembly are through electoral colleges. In the Eastern and Western Regions all adult taxpayers who are British subjects or British protected persons are qualified to vote. In the Northern Region, only males with these qualifications are entitled to vote. The Regional bodies select from their numbers those who are to sit in the House of Representatives.

**Land Policy**

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives. There is a small amount of Crown land acquired mainly for public purposes.

**Taxation**

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and general tax. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for non-natives throughout Nigeria, and natives in the township of Lagos, to pay a graduated income tax ranging from 4½d. in every £ of the first £200 to 15s. in the £ for every £ exceeding £10,000. There are special rates for incomes which do not exceed £150. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. In 1948 an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom Government for the avoidance of double taxation.

General tax is paid by natives outside the township of Lagos, assessed in a variety of ways from the individual assessment of wealthy traders in large towns to a flat rate in backward areas.

The other two main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duties.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African territories. It consists of notes of 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d., ½d. and tenth-penny. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par. In view of the need to conserve nickel supplies, new bronze pennies and half-pennies have been introduced.

Development Plans

Nigeria received an allocation of £23,000,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. In 1951 the plan was revised and it is now proposed to spend about £34 million between 1951 and 1956. The money is to be found from the following sources:

| Source                          | Amount   |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| Colonial Development and Welfare Grant | 16,212,584 |
| Nigeria Revenue                 | 8,020,557 |
| Loan funds                      | 9,950,450 |

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- **Basic Services**: £15,537,931 (45·4%)
- **Social Services**: £10,338,082 (30·3%)
- **Productive Services**: £8,307,638 (24·3%)

**Basic Services**.—14·09% of the total will be spent on buildings and 9·29% on roads.

**Social Services**.—13·08% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 8·63% on general education.

**Productive Services**.—8·96% of the total will be spent on agriculture.

Other Development

The Regional Production Development Boards are devoting large sums of money to the improvement of production methods for both food and export crops which is so essential to the well-being of the country. They include the operation of oil mills in the west and east, the distribution of artificial fertilizers, particularly in the north, a survey of cocoa soils, the establishment of a 20,000 acre cattle ranch in the east and a scheme for mechanizing rice cultivation in Sokoto. They are also spending large sums on roads. The Government has also set up a Development Board at Lagos to provide roads and services near Apapa Wharf to which the Colonial Development Corporation is lending £1½ million. The most important new industrial establishments were a new fruit-canning factory at Ibadan financed by the Western Regional Production Development Board and textile weaving mills at Lagos and Kano owned by Nigerian companies and being operated on their behalf by the Department of Commerce and Industries.

Education

There is a University College at Ibadan with faculties of arts, science, agriculture and medicine: funds have been voted for the erection of a Teaching Hospital, the University College Hospital, Ibadan. In 1952-53, there were 414 students of whom 370 were in residence in Ibadan and the others were completing clinical and other courses in the United Kingdom. The Zaria branch of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology is to be the biggest of the three branches of this Institution. In 1952-53 there were 31 students at Zaria and 8 at Ibadan. The branch at Enugu is not yet built. Other technical education is available at the Yaba Technical Institute where there were 197 full time students, and at the Yaba, Kaduna, Enugu and Ombo River Trade Centres with an attendance of 458 trainees. New centres were opened at Bukuru and Kano, while another at Sapele was in the course of construction. The Central Government awarded 140 scholarships for higher education in 1953 while between September 1952 and January 1953 the Eastern Regional Government made 230 awards and the Western Regional Government made 200 awards, tenable at University College, Ibadan, or overseas. There were 416 Central Government scholars in residence during 1952-53 distributed as follows: University College, Ibadan, 100; United Kingdom 301; United States of America 15. There were some 1,500 private Nigerian students in the United Kingdom and 400 in North America.

In 1952 there were 112 Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 28,737 students (25,407 male and 3,330 female); 116 Teacher Training Colleges and Centres with an enrolment of 7,201 students, and 9,610 Primary Schools with an enrolment of 1,062,321 students (811,157 male and 251,164 female).

Libraries and Museums

Lagos has a Municipal Library and other libraries are maintained by the British Council and the Public Relations Department. The latter has also organized a travelling library scheme.

A National Museum is under construction at Lagos and there are local museums at Jos, Ife, Oron and Benin.

Health

The principal diseases are malaria, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, cerebro-spinal meningitis, pneumonia, smallpox, leprosy, yaws, tuberculosis, dysentery, venereal diseases, intestinal parasites, filariasis, onchocerciasis, elephantiasis and tropical ulcers. 7,585 cases of sleeping sickness were treated in 1951-52 compared with 8,838 in 1950-51; 12,116 cases of smallpox; 6,791 of cerebro-spinal meningitis were treated and 5,500 of yellow fever were treated in the Eastern Region alone. Vaccinations against smallpox totalled 3,235,983. Considerable progress was made in the campaign against leprosy. There were 20,085 patients on sulphone treatment of whom 5,326 were discharged symptom-free. 727 miles of stream were cleared in the effort to control the tsetse fly.

Hospitals (excluding infectious diseases hospitals) numbered 127 of which 55 were in the Eastern Region. There were 972 Maternities (755 maintained by Native Authorities and 137 by Missions), 271 Maternity Centres and 4 Rural Health Centres. Beds available in hospitals totalled 7,701 and in Maternity Centres 2,430.
For every 100,000 of the population there were 0·407 hospitals, 3·12 Dispensaries and 0·868 Maternity Centres. One hospital bed was available to about every 4,000 of the population. 1,349,478 out-patients and 168,276 in-patients were treated in the hospitals and over 10 million cases were dealt with by Dispensaries. In Maternity Centres 59,317 deliveries were made and 730,098 attended for ante-natal treatment.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1952–53 was estimated at £3,773,699 compared with £458,384 in 1938–39.

Communications

Kano, Lagos and Maiduguri are international airports and there are 15 other airfields used by the internal services of West African Airways Corporation. The Corporation also operates services connecting Lagos with the other British West African territories, Dakar and Khartoum. International services of B.O.A.C., K.L.M. and Air France connect Nigeria with London, Western Europe, the Union of South Africa and French West and Equatorial Africa. A connexion to New York is available by the Pan American Service through Accra. The total number of aircraft movements in Nigeria for the periods ending 31st March, 1952 and 1953, were 26,444 and 30,110 respectively. The total number of passengers embarked for the same periods were 43,138 and 49,931, while those disembarked were 41,419 and 50,641. Transit passengers increased from 84,642 in 1951–52 to 126,147 in 1952–53. Full meteorological forecasting offices are established at Kano and Lagos under the control of the British West African Meteorological Service with headquarters in Lagos.

The Nigerian Railway carried 5,420,000 passengers in 1952–53 and 2,098,000 tons of freight. Route mileage totals 1,904 and track mileage 2,218, plus 133 miles of narrow gauge.

There are 28,807 miles of road (1952); bituminous surface 1,631 miles, gravel or earth surface 27,176 miles.

The main ports are Lagos and Port Harcourt and there are smaller ports at Calabar, Burutu, Sapele, Warri, Victoria and Tiko. Services for passengers and cargo from the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines Limited, which operates a regular fortnightly passenger service, Palm Line Limited, John Holt Line Limited and Elders and Fyffes. Cargo services are also operated from Scandinavian ports by Hoegh Line and Scandinavian West Africa Line.

The Nigerian Government maintains a service carrying passengers and coal between Lagos and Port Harcourt while there is a regular monthly service linking Lagos, Calabar and Victoria provided by Elder Dempster Lines. This company and the Palm Line also provide irregular services linking other coastal ports while a Spanish concern links Calabar and Fernando Po.

The river Niger and its chief tributary, the river Benue, are the principal inland water highways. The Niger is navigable for a distance of 537 miles upstream to Jebba and the Benue for 547 miles from Lokoja to Garua in the French Cameroons. Although the Benue and the upper reaches of the Niger are only navigable during a limited season at high water, both rivers provide an important alternative to the Nigerian Railway for the evacuation of produce. In all there are approximately 4,000 miles of navigable inland waterways in Nigeria.

Broadcasting

The Government runs broadcasting stations at Lagos (one 7½ kW. and two 0·3 kW.), Kaduna and Enugu (both with two 0·3 kW.). There were about 6,000 licence holders in 1952 with an estimated four listeners per receiver. The Government operates radiodiffusion systems in the Northern and Eastern Regions. There were almost 24,000 subscribers in 1952.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture and the largest number of wage earners is employed by the Government. In 1952, the total number of wage earners was about 700,000 of whom 4,000 were females. This figure does not include the many persons working for small employers. The following are the 1952 figures for those occupations in which there are more than 19,000 employees.

Government service ... ... ... 63,551
Transport ... ... ... 51,195
Metal Mining ... ... ... 44,336
Agriculture and Livestock production ... ... ... 44,430
Construction ... ... ... 30,204
Wholesale and retail trades ... ... ... 19,779

The next group below this is coal mining with 7,216.

There were in 1952 116 Trade Unions with a membership of 151,672. Seven unions had memberships in excess of 5,000 and aggregated 97,197. The largest Union is the Nigeria Union of Teachers.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are yams, cassava, guinea corn and millet, cocoyams, groundnuts, oil palms, maize, cocoa, rice and cotton.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: goats 10,738,000, cattle 5,860,000, sheep 5,622,000, horses 212,000, swine 221,000, asses 941,000.

Timber products are of three categories: logs, sawn timber and plywood, of which the first is the most important. 7·7 million cubic feet of logs and 0·9 million cubic feet of sawn timber were exported in 1952.

Despite extensive fishing in inland and coastal waters, the supply of fish does not meet the demand. At sea, improved methods of fishing by canoe and motor boat are being developed. The Colonial Development Corporation are operating two large trawlers. Inland reservoirs are being stocked and village fishing ponds started.

The chief minerals are tin, all of which is exported, and coal which is used almost entirely by the railway. Small quantities of columbite, lead, zinc and gold are also produced. Tin concentrates production runs at about 12,000 tons a year and coal at about 581,000 tons.

Apart from hand methods of expressing ground nut and palm oil, there are 57 palm oil mills operated mainly by Regional Production Development Boards; five groundnut oil mills, three of which are privately owned; three soap factories at Ibadan, Aba and Kano; a cigarette factory at Ibadan; a brewery at Lagos; several small plants producing fruit juices, minerals and soda water; a cannery; an up-to-date plywood and veneer factory at Sapele, several small sawmills elsewhere; two 50-loom weaving mills, one near Lagos, the other at Kano; some light engineering works; tyre re-treading plants; a ceramic factory; and several rice mills, some being Government-operated.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Four independent Marketing Boards handle the five main export crops—cocoa, palm kernels and palm oil, groundnuts and cotton. They ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, spend money on research and finance schemes for the economic benefit of the people in the producing areas. The Government and the Marketing Boards have a common policy of developing co-operative organizations. Its success is indicated by the fact that the tonnage of cocoa marketed by the Association of Nigerian Co-operative Exports was valued last season at £1,684,960 which represents a very large proportion of all cocoa sold to the Board by Nigerian licensed buying agents. The Government also finances the Department of Co-operative Societies whose activities and scope have expanded steadily.

At the end of 1952, there were 1,168 co-operative societies with a membership of 64,671. Their assets aggregated about £650,000.
