**THE WINDWARD ISLANDS**

**Area**

The total area of the Islands is 826 square miles.

**Population**

At the end of 1952 the total population was estimated at 292,000. The majority are of the negro race; less than 5% are white. There are a few persons of East Indian descent, and a few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica.

**Geographical Features**

The islands are of volcanic origin and the more sheltered coasts are fringed by reefs. Torrential streams from the more rugged areas tend to lose their gradient nearer the coast and the deposition of their sediments has led to the formation of fertile river flats and occasional river terraces. The residual clays on the rugged volcanic areas are comparatively fertile. One of the volcanoes in the Windward region (St. Vincent) was active in 1902. At the Soufrieres of Dominica and St. Lucia and in parts of Grenada hot sulphuretted gases still emerge and there are numerous hot springs which contain salts.

**Climate**

The prevailing trade winds provide a delightful climate. There is little variation between night and day.

**Principal Towns**

The capitals of the four colonies are:

- **Grenada**—St. George's (residence of Governor) .. 5,772 (1946 census)
- **Dominica**—Roseau .. 9,752 (1946 census)
- **St. Lucia**—Castries .. 18,000 (1952 estimate)
- **St. Vincent**—Kingstown .. 4,833 (1946 census)

**History**

As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government. On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad. On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

**Constitution and Administration**

Each of the four colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada, where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Windward Islands. The government of each colony is administered by a resident Administrator subject to instructions from the Governor. There is no common Legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. Each colony has a Legislative Council presided over by the Administrator, in which the majority of members are elected by universal adult suffrage; and each colony has an Executive Council which may be summoned and consulted by either the Governor or the Administrator. A Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the Chief Justices of the
several West Indian Islands except Jamaica was set up in 1920 and a Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established in 1939. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889. In 1951 revised constitutions were introduced in each of the four islands.

Land Policy

There is a small amount of Crown land reserved mainly for purposes of forest and water conservation. There is no restriction on the transfer of land except to aliens, for which the consent of the Governor in Executive Council is necessary.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. The other main forms of taxation are trade tariffs and excise duties. Some of the major crops are subject to an export tax.

Currency

The currency comprises dollar notes ($1 = 4s. 2d.) and British coinage. Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, and Trinidad) in currency unification.

Development

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 the Windward Islands received an allocation of £1,850,000. This was sub-allocated to the various colonies as follows:

| Colony     | Amount (£) |
|------------|-----------|
| Grenada    | 381,890   |
| St. Vincent| 345,858   |
| St. Lucia  | 374,632   |
| Dominica   | 339,120   |

A sum of £408,500 was reserved by the Governor for schemes covering more than one territory and for unforeseen contingencies.

Education

University education is provided at the University College of the West Indies in Jamaica. In the 1951-52 session there were 12 students from the Windward Islands. There are also a number of Windward Islands' students at universities in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.

Health

The principal diseases are malaria, enteric fever, helminthic diseases, yaws, venereal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis and dysentery.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, in co-operation with the World Health Organization, have made grants towards the implementation of insect control programmes in St. Lucia and Grenada. Applications have been submitted for the carrying out of similar projects in Dominica and St. Vincent.

Communications

Airfields have been constructed in Grenada and St. Lucia, and these two colonies are served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule. A temporary service with Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft is operated by the St. Vincent Government between Trinidad, Grenada, Carriacou, Barbados, St. Vincent and Dominica.

Broadcasting

A Colonial Development and Welfare grant has recently been approved to meet the capital and part of the recurrent costs of a broadcasting station in Grenada to serve the Windward Islands. The station will have a power of 5 kW.

DOMINICA

Area and Population

The area is approximately 305 square miles, and the estimated population for the year 1952 was 57,000.

Geographical Features

Dominica is mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island.

Climate

The climate on the whole is good. During the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

History

Dominica was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French
invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the garrison. In 1783 it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

**Constitution**

The present constitution was introduced on 29th September, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three *ex officio* members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two *ex officio* members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

**Taxation**

The main heads of taxation are income tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 2d. to 10s. in the £ of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 6s. on every £ of chargeable income. *Ad valorem* duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 10% to 20% preferential and 15% to 30% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Export duty, at a varying rate, is payable on all products exported. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars, black leaf tobacco.

**Public Finance**

| Revenue (including grant-in-aid from H.M. Treasury and C.D & W. issues) | Expenditure |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| $000 B.W.I.                 | $000 B.W.I. |

| 1948                        | 886         | 958         |
| 1949                        | 1,307       | 1,396       |
| 1950                        | 1,604       | 1,684       |
| 1951                        | 2,043       | 2,048       |
| 1952                        | 2,377       | 2,292       |

Of the total revenue in 1952, $1,016,926 was derived from Customs, $129,457 from Taxes and $115,798 from Fees of Court, etc.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Education $219,093, Medical $215,853, Police $165,547, Public Works $424,219. Prior to 1940 Governor, Legislature, Audit and Judicial were borne by the Federal Government, Leeward Islands.

**Development Plans**

$774,120 has been allocated to the Colony under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945 for the ten-year period ending 31st March, 1956. Development Schemes fall into six main heads on which commitments are as follows:

- Agriculture and Forestry: $1,003,406
- Public Works: $1,601,515
- Education: $271,008
- Medical: $208,536
- Social Welfare: $76,032
- Miscellaneous: $149,698

In addition to the above, the Colony is engaged upon a further programme of Public Works amounting to $960,000 financed from Loan Funds, as set out below:

- Ferro-concrete Jetty at Roseau: $321,600
- Goodwill Housing Scheme (Town expansion and slum clearance): $177,600
- Prison and Police Barracks and Fire Station: $62,400
- Unallocated: $52,800
- Roads: $345,600

There is a large new construction programme of Public Works which may be further increased. A fair portion of the Development and Welfare Funds allocated to Agriculture, Education and to Medical programmes are for building construction of offices, officers' quarters, schools, etc., which have to be built by the Public Works Department.

Development of the banana industry is being assisted by Government advances to planters and a sum of $72,000 has been set aside for this purpose.

**Other Development**

The Colonial Development Corporation is engaged on development of Melville Hall Estate, in the northern part of the island. They completed the construction of a hydro-electric plant near Roseau early in 1953.

Recent industrial development by private enterprise includes a fruit-canning factory, producing canned bananas, grapefruit segments and juice and citrus peel as well as jams and jellies made from locally-grown fruits.

**Education**

There are 43 Elementary Schools with a total enrolment of 10,835 pupils, and four Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 656 pupils. There are also 12 private or temporary schools with an enrolment of 426 pupils. There is no technical school nor any local institution of Higher Education. The number of students from this Colony known to be in Universities or University Colleges abroad is:

- United Kingdom: 12
- Canada: 6
- Jamaica (University College of the West Indies): 6
- Trinidad (I.C.T.A.): 1
- France: 1
- Belgium: 1

In 1952 Government expenditure on Education was approximately $219,000 as compared with $35,976 in 1935.
Health

There are five Government hospitals including a Leper Home with a total of 200 beds. The latest available annual figure for out-patients is 13,867 and for in-patients 2,772. Regular clinics are held throughout the year by District Medical Officers at the 19 dispensaries distributed all over the island. A Maternal, Child Hygiene and School Health Service with its Headquarters in Roseau is operated by a Senior Health Visitor, assisted by three Health Visitors, under the direction of the Senior Medical Officer. As part of its functions the clinic distributes free milk, cod liver oil and food yeast to needy and undernourished children. There are also an Anti-Yaws Campaign and a Dental Service.

The Health Department with its auxiliary the Public Health Engineering Unit is under the control of the Senior Medical Officer who is also Chairman of the Central Board of Health. This Board is statutorily constituted and is responsible to Government for the initiation and carrying out of public health measures.

Government expenditure on medical and allied services in 1952 was $215,854 compared with $42,154 in 1925-26 and $19,243 in 1936.

Communications

There are 102 miles of oiled surface roads and 244 miles of secondary roads. Leeward coast villages are linked by a coastal motor launch service.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture is the principal occupation and provides employment for about 5,000 wage-earners in addition to about 3,000 peasants. Road and building construction workers are estimated at 2,000. There are two trade unions with an estimated membership of 5,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are limes, bananas, coconuts, grapefruit, oranges, cocoa, vanilla, mangoes, avocado pears and various ground provisions for domestic use. The main products are raw and sweetened lime juice, lime oil, copra and rum.

The livestock population consists of about 5,000 head of cattle. A Government stock farm has been established in order to stimulate expansion of the livestock industry.

There is considerable production of timber for local use, but no export trade.

The production of handicrafts from local straws is a widespread minor industry. The annual value of production is estimated at $36,000.

GRENADE

Area

The total area is 133 square miles. The Colony includes certain of the small islands known as the Grenadines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area of about 13 square miles.

Population

The estimated population of 81,000 is for the most part “coloured”. There is a small “white” population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers.

Geographical Features

In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat disordered topography of mountains and fairly deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of mountains traverses the whole length, closer to the western than the eastern coastline. The highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), Fedon’s Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along the east and south-east the mountains slope gradually towards the sea. The south coast is deeply indented by numerous natural harbours. The island is well-watered by quick-flowing streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approximately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800 feet in the centre of the Island.

Climate

Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month, and November the wettest.

History

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased the island from a French company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George’s. This venture did not pay and Du Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac from whom it was in turn purchased by the Crown of France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. In 1795-96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. Many atrocities were committed, including the cold-blooded murder of the Governor. The rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there has been peace in Grenada.

Constitution

The present constitution was introduced on 1st August, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor’s absence, the Attorney-General and the Colonial Treasurer); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, (President), two ex officio members (the Attorney-General and the Colonial Treasurer); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Council elects one of its members to be Deputy President. The presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

In 1952 a Public Service Commission was appointed to advise the Governor in matters affecting certain appointments and staff dispositions.

Taxation

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and general tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale of 3% to 50% in the $ for individuals, companies paying a special rate of 35% in the $. An agreement was reached in 1949 with various Governments for the avoidance of double taxation. Taxation is enforced in other forms through import, export and excise duties and licences.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 815,040     | 825,394        |
| 1948 | 2,749,672   | 3,292,002      |
| 1949 | 2,647,857   | 3,163,295      |
| 1950 | 3,775,261   | 2,979,383      |
| 1951 | 3,942,028   | 3,840,416      |
| 1952 | 3,877,884   | 3,788,359      |

The slight favourable revenue balance maintained over the period 1948-51 has been due to collections of import, export, additional export and excise duties and income tax which in turn have been entirely dependent on world market prices of cocoa and nutmegs. The actual expenditure in 1952 was 10-96% in excess of the estimated
figure mainly on account of new Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes approved during the year, and storm damage.

At the end of 1952 the Public Debt amounted to $2,886,332 and accumulated Sinking Funds to $687,194.

Development Plans

Grenada received an allocation of $1,833,071 (£381,890) under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a Ten-Year Development Plan. In 1946 and again in 1950 this amount was augmented by sums totalling $459,264 making a total figure of $2,292,335 (£477,570).

The Plan was prepared and adopted in 1948 and, at the time, it was proposed to raise a loan of $2,400,000 for use in conjunction with the original Colonial Development and Welfare grant to finance it.

In 1950 the Plan was revised and the uncommitted balance of the allocation which stood at $1,336,610 was reallocated for expenditure over the period 1950-56. In addition, the proposed loan of $2,400,000 which had not yet been negotiated was scaled down to $1,500,000 and this loan was eventually secured in the London market in 1952.

During the period 1950-56 more than $1,000,000 of Development and Welfare money will be devoted to schemes relating to agriculture and fisheries. The most expensive, and the most productive, agricultural scheme, is for cocoa rehabilitation for which a sum of $412,000 has been earmarked. Expenditure on other schemes is being created in the following order of priority: Water Supplies, Electricity, Police Headquarters, Research, Queen's Park Bridge, Medical, Education, Slum Clearance and Housing, Reclamation, Revision of Laws, Civil Service Housing, Social Welfare, Communications, Printing.

Other Development

It has not so far been possible to attract the assistance of any organization of suitable capacity by way of investing in any desirable major development scheme at present beyond the competence of the Colony to finance. Two such schemes are the development of the Morne Rouge area in the interest of tourism and the provision of a deep water pier at St. George's.

Education

There are 53 Primary Schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 18,285 and average attendance amounting to 12,770. Compulsory attendance is enforced in the capital and one other area where accommodation is regarded as adequate. Twelve of the Primary Schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned structures of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are three housecraft and three handicraft centres. There is also a visual education unit which serves the whole Colony. Five Secondary Schools (one Government and four grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,106 of which 183 are scholarship or exhibition holders. Two of the schools are for boys only, two for girls only and one co-educational. One additional Secondary School for girls (300 places) is at present under construction by the Roman Catholic authorities. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate standard and the Grenada Boys' Secondary School also prepares pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1952 was $405,090. In 1935 the total expenditure on education amounted to $73,080.

The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships, one tenable at a university in the British Empire, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad.

Health

There have been no epidemics of infectious diseases recently. Malaria is still prevalent, but with the assistance of W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. organizations, an Insect Control Programme is now in operation. The Colony Hospital is at St. George's. Two of its medical officers are engaged in a yaws and venereal disease campaign. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew's, is a modern building recently constructed, and provides 32 beds. There is another small hospital at Carriacou. There are 21 district medical visiting stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Here, too, maternity and child welfare work is done. There are two main Health Centres—St. George's and Gouyave—and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.

Expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1952 amounted to $528,850 compared with $97,987 in 1935.

Communications

The airfield is at Pearls, and has a runway 5,280 feet long and 150 feet wide.

There are approximately 472 miles of good roads divided into four classes according to standard of construction. Over 200 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.

The chief ports are St. George's (possessing a good harbour and a deep water pier), Grenville and Hillsborough (Carriacou). Cargo services are operated by the Harrison Line steamers from the United Kingdom and by calls of the Canadian National Steamship Company and the Alcoa Line from Canadian and United States ports. The Canadian National Line and Caribbean Fruit Company boats also carry passengers. Several small motor, auxiliary and sailing vessels ply regularly between the islands.

ST. LUCIA

Area and Population

The area is 238 square miles and the population 83,000 (1952 end-year estimate).

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, the highest peak being Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet). The most spectacular mountains are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September–October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

### History

The date and the person who discovered St. Lucia are unknown, for according to the known evidence of Columbus's voyages, Columbus appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for £1,600 to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1663 Thomas Warner of St. Kitts made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1744 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April, 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June, 1803, was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

### Constitution

The present constitution was introduced on 1st August, 1951. There is an Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three *ex officio* members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two *ex officio* members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is president of the Council, and there is a deputy-president appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

### Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 6d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

| 1952 | 1,097,451  | 974,799        |

It was estimated that in 1952 25·7% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise duties, and 8·6% from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: 13·82%
- Administration: 16·30%
- Public Works: 18·48%
- Development: 42·74%

The Public Debt of the Colony at 31st December, 1952 stood at $2,274,055 which includes $1,958,400 loaned for Castries Reconstruction and $21,600 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds for Vide Boutielle Housing. The accumulated Sinking Funds towards its redemption stood at $136,963.

At 31st December, 1952, unrepaid loans from revenue not shown in the above assets amounted to $1,157,412.

Development Plans

Under the 1945 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, St. Lucia was allocated £374,632. In 1950 an allocation of £150,000 towards a road programme was agreed and an additional grant of £200,000 was made available to implement the agricultural development plans of the Colony based upon the recommendations of a Team of Experts which visited the Island in 1951. In 1950 the United Kingdom Government agreed to provide up to a maximum of £1,025,000 to assist the St. Lucia Government to rebuild public buildings and housing accommodation in Castries which were destroyed by the fire of 1948. Since that time a further £84,000 has been provided by Her Majesty's Government for that purpose. The Colonial Development Corporation have been active in the reconstruction of Castries since 1948. The reconstruction programme was completed in 1953.

Education

In the 1951-52 session there were two students from St. Lucia at the University College of the West Indies, Jamaica. There were 13 students at Universities in the United Kingdom, six in Canada, eight in the United States, and one at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture. Of these, 11 held Government scholarships, the balance being private students. There were two Secondary Schools with 517 pupils on the roll, and 48 Primary Schools with a total of 13,459 pupils enrolled. The Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies conducted adult education classes throughout the year, and the aggregate attendance was 2,707. The total estimated expenditure for 1952 was £64,140, compared with £6,692 in 1935.

Health

The most prevalent diseases are malaria, enteric fever, heart diseases, helminthic diseases, yaws, dysentery and venereal diseases. Beds available in hospitals total 154, in addition to out-patient treatment. There are 12 dispensaries and health outposts and a day nursery; some 28,500 persons attend clinics or health outposts yearly. The World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund have made grants towards the implementation of insect control in St. Lucia.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1952 was estimated at £55,995, as compared with £11,624 in 1935.

Communications

There are two airfields, the Vigie Airport, and the Beane Field Airport. Air services with the other islands are maintained by British West Indian Airways Incorporated, and chartered flights by K.L.M. and British Guiana Airways. The island's road system comprises the following:

| Miles |
|-------|
| Main roads | 105-64 |
| Second Class Roads | 95-65 |
| Unclassified Roads | 169-85 |
| Total | 371-14 |

Cargo steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa Steamships, the Harrison Line, the Caribbean Fruit Company, and numerous inter-island craft are the main means of communication by sea. Castries handles about 945,000 gross tons of shipping annually.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture (16,000). Other gainful occupations are fishing (1,043), manufacturing (4,000), public services (1,199), lumbering (221), transportation (588), and quarrying (68).

ST. VINCENT

Area

The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population

The population at the end of 1951 was 70,130.

Geographical Features

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufriere (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 87 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At Kingstown, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 85·8°, and the rainfall 104·17 inches, in 1951.

History

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British 14 years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, when France declared war on Britain in 1778, St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

Constitution

The present constitution was introduced on 1st October, 1951. There is an Executive Council normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, and comprising three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Colonial Treasurer); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council; one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; and three members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Colonial Treasurer); three nominated members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is president of the Council, and there is a deputy-president appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit.

Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 78 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 30 cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty, which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 14s. 2d. per proof gallon.

(a) Estimate.

In 1952 Customs and excise duties produced $1,099,849 (or 52·3%) of the total revenue while direct taxation yielded $317,265 (or 15·6%).
The Public Debt at 31st December, 1952, was $564,772, equivalent to $8·10 per head of the population.

Development Plans

The Ten-Year Development Plan, compiled in 1946, envisaged an allocation of £345,858 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945, supplemented by £401,500 from Loan Funds and £359,075 from Colony Funds. In 1951 the Plan was revised, and for the period 1951–56 it is proposed to spend £129,700 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds and £174,200 from Loan Funds on development schemes, allocated as follows:

| C.D. & W. Funds | Loan Funds |
|-----------------|------------|
| Agriculture     | 78,700     |
| Industrial Development | 11,000   |
| Miscellaneous    | 40,000     |

In 1951 and 1952 additional allocations of Colonial Development and Welfare money totalling £100,000 were granted to the Colony.

Other Development

A Development Committee has been formed to advise the Government on projects likely to add to the economic well-being of the Colony. The Colonial Development Corporation has been granted an 80-year franchise for the establishment and operation of a hydro-electric scheme. Plans are under consideration for the extension of the cultivation of tree crops, particularly cocoa and coffee, in areas now covered with forest, and for the establishment of another sugar factory.

Education

In 1952 there were two Government Secondary Schools and one grant-aided Secondary School with an enrolment of 528 pupils and 41 Primary Schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 14,925 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions.

During 1951–52 some 32 St. Vincent students were attending Universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1952 expenditure on educational services amounted to approximately $326,480, of which the contribution of the United Kingdom under Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $10,991. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

Health

Of tropical diseases yaws is prevalent, and tuberculosis is a major health problem but does not appear to be increasing (average deaths over a five-year period were 53 annually). Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 20 dispensaries, at which approximately 25,000 cases were treated in 1952, hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery) .. 116
- Maternity .. .. .. 16
- Tuberculosis .. .. .. 40
- Mental .. .. .. 100
- Leprosy .. .. .. 20
- Pauper Home .. .. .. 125

In 1952 in-patients numbered 3,075; out-patients, 2,811.

Total expenditure in 1952 on Government Health and Medical Services was $335,388; in 1935, $66,945.

Communications

The seadrome is situated at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown. There are about 400 miles of roads of which some 100 miles are motorable throughout the year; 46½ miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 36½ miles of metalled roads and about 310½ miles of earth roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly cargo service is provided from Canada, by the Canadian National Steamship Company, with limited passenger accommodation. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service every six weeks by the Harrison Line. The Alcoa Steamships call southbound from Canada fortnightly via the islands and proceed to New York approximately every five weeks. The Caribbean Fruit Company have recently started a passenger and cargo service which operates between Trinidad, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Barbados. Schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

Principal Occupations

Estimated numbers employed in the principal occupations are:

- Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing .. 12,000
- Manufacturing Industries .. .. .. 2,500
- Hotel and Personal Services .. .. .. 2,000
- Transport and Communications .. .. .. 1,800
- Building and Other Construction .. .. .. 1,800
- Commerce .. .. .. 1,500
- Public Services and other Services .. .. .. 1,000

Trade Unions

| Membership |
|------------|
| The United Workers', Peasants' and Ratepayers' Union .. 1,100 |
| The General Workers' Union .. .. .. 35 |
| The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers' Union .. .. .. 2,500 |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are arrowroot, cotton, copra and coconut, sweet potatoes, groundnuts and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is: goats 11,039; cattle 7,741; sheep 3,294; horses and mules 253; swine 9,369.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

There is fairly extensive fishing in-shore but very little is done off-shore. Catches are often insufficient to meet demand.

There are a good many privately-owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a soap and cigarette factory; an oil expressing and refining plant for cotton seed and coconut oil, with their by-products of stock feed and manure, and a deodorizing plant for the treatment of coconut and fish oils at the Central Cotton Ginnery; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks.

**ZANZIBAR**

**Area**

Zanzibar Island is 640 square miles in area, and Pemba 380 square miles.

**Population**

The population was 264,162 at the 1948 census. (Zanzibar Island 149,575 and Pemba 114,587; racial composition:—Europeans 296; Arabs 44,560; Indians, including Pakistanis and Goans, 15,892; Africans 199,975; others 3,439.) The latest estimate is 270,700.

**Geographical Features**

The island of Zanzibar is the largest coralline island on the East African coast and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. To the north-east at a distance of some 25 miles lies the island of Pemba. Both islands are low-lying, the highest land being little over 390 feet (Masingini Ridge).

**Climate**

The mean maximum temperature is 84·4° and the mean minimum 76·6° (Zanzibar Town). The warmest season is from January to March (average 82° to 86°) and the coolest, June to September (average 75° to 78°). The average annual rainfall in Pemba varies from 65 inches in the north to 95 inches in the south; in Zanzibar from 48 inches to over 80 inches, the maximum being recorded in the centre of the Island. There is no real dry season but the rainy seasons are well marked, being March to May in the south-west monsoon and in November and December at the start of the north-east monsoon.

**Principal Towns**

| Town            | Population |
|-----------------|------------|
| Zanzibar Township | 45,284     |
| Wete (Pemba)    | 3,502      |
| Chake Chake (Pemba) | 3,010     |
| Mkoani (Pemba)  | 877        |

**History**

In 1698 the Arabs of Oman captured Mombasa, where the Portuguese had built a fort in 1592. Thereafter the whole of the East African coast as far south as Cape Delgado, including Zanzibar and Pemba, passed from Portuguese...
into Arab hands. Seyyid Said bin Sultan, the founder of modern Zanzibar and of its clove industry, was elected to the Imamate in 1804 and transferred his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar in 1832, and during his reign Zanzibar became both politically and commercially the principal town in East Africa. In 1861, by an award of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India, the Imam's possessions in Africa became independent of Muscat and from that date Oman and Zanzibar have remained politically separate.

By an agreement in 1886 Great Britain and Germany recognized the Sultanate of Zanzibar over the islands of the coast (including Zanzibar and Pemba) and a ten-mile wide strip on the mainland.

In 1887 the Sultan handed over the administration of many of his possessions on the African Continent to the British East Africa Association (later, the Imperial British East Africa Company). The Government of these territories eventually passed to the British Government when they became known as the British East Africa Protectorate (later, Kenya Colony and Protectorate) and the Uganda Protectorate. Zanzibar still receives the sum of £10,000 a year from Kenya as rent for these possessions.

In June 1889 Zanzibar and Pemba were placed under British protection by the Sultan, Seyyid Ali bin Said. The Protectorate was proclaimed in 1890 and the following year a regular form of Government was set up.

The present Sultan acceded in 1911. In 1914 the control of the Sultanate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, the offices of His Majesty's Agent and Consul-General and His Highness' First Minister being merged in that of the newly created post of British Resident who was appointed subject to the control of the Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate as High Commissioner. At the same date a Protectorate Council was constituted as an advisory body with His Highness as President and the British Resident as Vice-President.

In 1925 the office of High Commissioner was abolished and the British Resident was made directly responsible to the Colonial Office. Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted in 1926 in place of the old advisory Protectorate Council.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered by a British Resident who exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1924. The Executive Council is presided over by the Sultan with the British Resident as Vice-President and consists of the Heir Apparent to the Throne, four *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Senior Commissioner and the Financial Secretary) and three official members. The Legislative Council is presided over by the British Resident and comprises four *ex officio*, five official, and eight unofficial members. The unofficial members are nominated by the Sultan by and with the advice of the British Resident and include three Arabs, two Africans, two Indians and one European.

**Land Policy**

Under the Land Alienation Decree of 1939, subject to certain provisos, permanent alienation of land leases exceeding two years, and mortgages, by Arabs or Africans have no effect without the consent of a Land Alienation Board. In certain of the more undeveloped areas of the island, mainly inhabited by the indigenous Africans, the land is communally held and, according to native custom, cannot be alienated. But throughout the plantation areas (west and centre of both islands) land is freehold and there is no other statutory qualification as to its disposal. A good deal of land is, however, reserved under the system of quasi-religious dedication of Muslim law, known as *Wakf*.

**Taxation**

The principal sources of taxation are Customs import duty, clove duty and income tax. There is no poll or hut tax.

The Income Tax Decree provides for taxation on incomes of over £200 but exempts income from agricultural sources. The rate of taxation is Shs. 1/50 in the £.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 465,382    | 463,602        |
| 1948 | 901,208    | 937,673        |

| 1952 | 1,643,752  | 1,663,653      |

**Public Debt**: a loan from the National Bank of India Finance and Development Corporation Limited for the new Zanzibar Electricity Scheme. The authorized total of the loan is £250,000, of which approximately £126,000 was drawn up to 31st December, 1953.

The main heads of expenditure in 1952 were: agriculture £111,582, health £193,482, education £193,600, provincial administration £66,536, public works £401,938, pensions £114,293, police £80,656, port and marine £116,085.

The chief sources of revenue in 1952 were: import duty £350,184, clove duty £291,018, licences, etc., £125,406, Fees of Court, etc., £152,552, and Colonial Development and Welfare grants £110,267.

**Currency**

The standard coin of the Protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Shs. 20 = £1) with the following subsidiary coinage:—50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent (bronze). East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon. The amount in circulation at 31st December, 1952, was £294,250 notes and £270,100 coin.

**Development Plans**

Zanzibar has received grants to a total of £1,275,134 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. These grants have been made in connexion with the Ten-year Development Programme. The programme was revised in 1951 and since that time practically all the permanent recurrent expenditure has been taken into the Protectorate Estimates. To offset this, revenue from "development duties" (which until 1951 accrued to the Development Authority) is now paid direct to Protectorate revenue while an annual subvention is made from Protectorate Funds to meet expenditure by the Protectorate in connexion with the Development Programme.

It is anticipated that by the end of March 1956, expenditure on development schemes will have been in the following proportions:—
