SINGAPORE

Area

The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islands, is 224.5 square miles. The City of Singapore covers an area of 31.5 square miles.

The area of Christmas Island is 62 square miles and of the Cocos-Keeling Islands, a group of 27 small coral islands, 5 square miles.

Population

The estimated population at 1st July, 1953, was:

|                | Singapore |
|----------------|-----------|
| Chinese        | 859,201   |
| Malays         | 136,887   |
| Indians        | 87,213    |
| Europeans      | 15,811    |
| Eurasians      | 11,130    |
| Others         | 10,535    |
| **Total**      | **1,120,777** |

The population of Singapore City, the seat of Government, is about 800,704.

|                | Christmas Island |
|----------------|------------------|
| Chinese        | 1,289            |
| Malays         | 387              |
| Indians        | 8                |
| Europeans      | 105              |
| Eurasians      | 1                |
| **Total**      | **1,790**        |

The population of the Cocos-Keeling Islands, which numbered 1,000 in July 1952, has since been reduced by emigration to about 605.

Geographical Features

The highest point on Singapore Island is 581 feet above sea level. The largest permanent stream is the Sungei Seletar which is nine miles long. Forest and Nature Reserves, including mangrove swamps, total about 15 square miles.

The greater part of Christmas Island is a central plateau 600–700 feet above sea level, rising to low hills up to 1,170 feet. Most of the island is densely wooded; it contains extensive deposits of mixed phosphates. The island lies about 190 nautical miles south of the western extremity of Java.

The Cocos-Keeling Islands are a low-lying coral atoll, thickly covered with coconut palms; the highest point above sea level is 25 feet. The islands lie about 700 nautical miles south-west of Java.
Climate of Singapore

There are no well-defined dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The mean maximum temperature is $87^\circ$, the mean minimum $74^\circ$; average annual rainfall is 95 inches.

History

A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme, and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits: it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the Imperial Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was recovered on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, and was constituted a separate Colony.

Despite the despoliation it suffered during the occupation, and the post-war unrest which culminated in 1948 in the Malayan Emergency, Singapore entered a new phase of prosperity which was accentuated by the increased world demand for rubber. In 1951 imports were valued at $3,625,000,000 and exports at $4,095,000,000.

The Malayan Emergency has had its inevitable effect on Singapore, particularly in 1950 when there were many terrorist outrages. In December 1950 occurred the tragic riots arising from the "Bertha Hertogh" case, in which 18 people were killed. Public security was greatly improved during 1951, but must remain a constant concern of the Government so long as the Emergency lasts.

Constitution

The Colony of Singapore is constituted by the Singapore Colony Orders in Council 1946-50. These together with the Royal Instructions of 27th March, 1946, as amended from time to time, provide for:

(a) a Governor and Commander-in-Chief appointed by Commission under Her Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet.

(b) an Executive Council, consisting of the Governor as Chairman; four ex officio members (namely, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, and the President, City Council); two nominated official members; four nominated unofficial members; two elected members elected by the nominated unofficials and elected members of the Legislative Council from among themselves.

(c) a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President; four ex officio members (as for the Executive Council); five nominated official members; four nominated unofficial members; and not more than twelve elected members of whom three are severally elected by the European, Chinese and Indian Chambers of Commerce, and the remainder by popular franchise from nine single-member Electoral Districts.

Land Policy

From the foundation of the Settlement of Singapore there has never been any restriction on the alienation of land to non-natives. Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant Crown land within the City area is practically exhausted and large areas are in process of acquisition for public purposes, particularly housing.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the Colony or received in the Colony from outside. Companies are chargeable at 30% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 3% on the first $500 of chargeable income and rising to 30% on incomes exceeding $50,000. Non-resident individuals are chargeable at 20%, but British subjects and British protected persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. A double taxation arrangement with the United Kingdom is in force.
Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue       | Expenditure   |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 1946 (9 months) | $29,498,716   | $24,352,910   |
| 1947    | $77,967,858   | $51,824,007   |
| 1948    | $81,270,049   | $74,241,605   |
| 1949    | $108,782,253  | $94,257,156   |
| 1950    | $114,016,040  | $97,117,474   |
| 1951    | $175,607,908  | $127,397,183  |
| 1952    | $210,361,686  | $167,734,073  |

In 1952 33·19% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 44·90% from income and other taxes.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Administration—general 10·17%, Social Services 20·38%, Judicial, Police and Prisons 14·17% and Miscellaneous Services 22·16%.

The Public Debt of the Colony of Singapore at the 31st December 1952 amounted to $115 million or approximately $107 per head of the population. The Public Debt comprises:

- (a) S.S. 3% Loan, 1962–72 .. 30
- (b) S.S. 3% War Loan, 1952–59 .. 25
- (c) S.S. 3% War Loan, 1953–60 .. 10
- (d) Singapore 3% Rehabilitation Loan, 1962–70 .. 50

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is exclusive legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
   (a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners;
   (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.
   (c) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December, 1952, and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation as at 31st December, 1952, was $23,186,791·45.

The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1952, was $786,797,438·86 and coins (other than silver) $25,263,669·33.

Development Plans

Thirty separate projects of the Singapore Development Plan are now being actively pursued. The expenditure on these projects is expected to be approximately £75,144,000 over a ten-year period ending in 1960. The group nature of these projects is set out in the table below.

| Group                  | Expenditure (£) | Per cent. |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Agriculture            | 514,000        | 4,405     |
| Transport/Communications| 9,531,200      | 81,682    |
| Fuel/Power             | 15,523,600     | 133,037   |
| Multi-Purpose          | 4,063,000      | 34,820    |
| Social Capital         | 45,172,700     | 387,131   |
| Research               | 340,000        | 2,914     |
| **Total**              | **75,144,500** | **643,989**|

The emphasis is on improved social facilities, improved port facilities (wharf extension and a new graving dock) and improved communications (a new international airport and road extensions). The largest single project is that for housing, expenditure on which is estimated at about £22 million. Housing comes within the group of social capital projects which themselves represent 60% of the total cost of the plan. They include also water supply extensions (£8·3 million), education plans (£6·6 million) and medical services development (£4·9 million). The second largest project is that of the Power Station at Pasir Panjang and associated auxiliary works. The complete scheme is estimated to cost £15 million and the ultimate capacity of the new plant will be 150,000 kW. By mid-1953 two turbo-alternators with a capacity of 50,000 kW had been brought into service. It is estimated that over £9 million will have been spent on this project alone by the end of 1953. The construction of the new international airport at Paya Lebar is now well advanced and it is expected that the airport will be in operational use by early 1955. The total cost will be a little under £4½ million. Construction of the new graving dock is expected to be well advanced by the beginning of 1954.

Smaller projects, which are now in progress, include an expenditure of over £3½ million on town planning and road development, the construction of veterinary quarantine stations and abattoirs, improvements in radio broadcasting facilities and the establishment of a regional marine research station.

These projects are being undertaken by the Government of the Colony, the City Council, the Singapore Improvement Trust and the Singapore Harbour Board. With the exception of Colonial Development and Welfare Fund grants, the Development Plan has been financed entirely by local resources. The expenditure on Government projects is met from revenue. Funds for the Improvement Trust's housing programmes are provided by Government loans. The City Council's projects are largely financed by loan monies raised in Singapore by the issue of Municipal Debenture Stocks though some revenue money has been applied to capital development projects.

Other Development

The 53-acre industrial estate of the Colonial Development Corporation has continued to develop. The estate is sub-divided into factory sites and several enterprises began actual production in 1953. These include the production of edible oils and, for the first time in Singapore, yarn. Other factories are under construction or almost completed and among the latter are factories which will produce Manila rope and boot polish.
The Corporation also wholly owns the Federal and Colonial Building Society, Limited, which was set up to assist in alleviating the housing shortage. The authorized capital is £50 million (£5,833,333) of which the paid-up capital is approximately £945,000. Approximately 1,400 loans have been negotiated between March 1950 and September 1953, and the total amount advanced has been approximately £2,000,000. The Society operates on a pan-Malayan basis but in practice 80% of the borrowers so far live in Singapore.

Education

The 536 schools in the Colony provide education for some 163,300 students of whom 72,000 are taught in English and the remainder in the main vernacular languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). 5,200 teachers are employed, about 40% of them being trained. Approximately 13% of the students are in Secondary Classes. The Junior Technical School provides for 200 boys following day courses, and about 1,300 enrolments in 45 evening classes. 670 men and 290 women students are under training in the Teachers' Training College, the majority on part-time courses while working as student probationer teachers in the schools. The University of Malaya has 238 men and 84 women students from Singapore. Fifty-one Government Scholarships are held at the University of Malaya or at Universities and Colleges overseas. Adult Education Classes are expanding and are now attended by 8,000 persons. The Singapore Education Committee advises Government on all aspects of education, and the Education Finance Board scrutinizes and approves the Departmental estimates before their submission to Government. The net cost of Education in 1952 was $17·81 million (capital expenditure $2·35 million), compared with $3·38 million (capital expenditure $0·22 million) in 1947. The large increase is due to the implementation of the Ten-Year and Supplementary Plans.

Health

The Government Medical Department provides some 4,700 beds in its eight hospitals and Leper Settlement of which some 1,600 are available for the treatment of acute disease. There are six static dispensaries, four travelling dispensaries and a floating dispensary service for general cases among the population of over 300,000 in the rural areas, and a chain of 41 centres where the Government maternity and child welfare division operates in addition. A school medical and dental service and a quarantine service are working on a steadily expanding basis.

A ten-year Medical Plan is in operation to double all the existing services and provide adequate service for the whole population by 1960, and a well-appointed Nurses' Home, for 250 nurses, a new outpatients' division, with a modern blood-transfusion unit at the Civil General Hospital of 800 beds, and two large rural health centres were completed and opened in 1953. Work has already begun on improvements and extensions to the Maternity Hospital covering both accommodation and teaching facilities. Under the Plan the Tuberculosis Hospital will be built up to 1,100 beds from the present 400 beds. A start in this direction is expected this year. New wards are being built at the Children's Orthopaedic Hospital and at the centre for leprosy cases. The Venereal Diseases campaign is conducted on most up-to-date lines with a special hospital, clinics, a travelling dispensary and a follow-up visiting scheme.

In the field of tuberculosis, out-door treatment is provided at a clinic and domiciliary relief assistance by the Almoners' Department was rapidly expanding; a B.C.G. campaign was successfully started in 1951. If the average incidence of tuberculosis from 1939-41 is taken as 100, the index, which rose to 170 during the Japanese occupation, has shown a steady decline over the post war period to 39 in 1952. Some 14,500 cases of tuberculosis have passed through this centre since 1946 and the number of out-patients in regular attendance is 5,200. The problem remains one of the most urgent, however, and plans for more beds and a Chest Unit are in hand. The Royal Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association with its own clinic and treatment centre gives most valuable co-operation to the Government. This Association is also greatly extending the scope of its service, particularly in rehabilitation. The Tuberculosis Treatment Allowance Scheme is operated by the Department of Social Welfare. The payment under this scheme is restricted to patients whose prognosis is good and who are likely to be returned to their former working capacity within a reasonable space of time.

Main hospital out-patient attendances, which were under 100,000 per annum before the war, rose to over 700,000 in 1952; yearly attendances at rural and maternity clinics in the same period have risen from 85,000 to 188,024. Homes visited by nurses now total 23,250 and by midwives 46,735. An attempt is made to see all rural births, while the Maternity Hospital deals with some 18,000 maternity cases yearly or over 30% of the total births of the Colony. In-patients in the main acute hospitals total over 55,000 per annum, compared with 26,000 before the war. Leprosy services are being rapidly modernized and some 1,500 patients are under treatment or observation.

There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualifications of M.B. and B.S., registrable in the United Kingdom, can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery; also registrable in the United Kingdom), the Diploma of Pharmacy and the Diploma of the Royal Sanitary Institute. A complete course for nurses is in operation and the local qualification is now registrable in England and Wales.

Statutory Boards cover all medical, nursing, dental and pharmacy activities, and there is an Hospitals Board.

Health figures for the Colony continue to improve. Although the population is increasing by some 35,000 a year through natural means the death rate decreased from 19·51 in 1939 to 11·20 in 1952. The infantile death rate fell from 130·4 per thousand in 1939 to 69·97 in 1952. With no outbreak of any of the major infectious diseases, Singapore remains one of the healthiest city ports in the Far East. The birth rate at 47·53 continues to be one of the highest in the world. This has resulted in a very young population with its special and peculiar problems.

All the usual special Departments such as eye, ear, nose and throat and orthopaedics, are included in the hospital services. Physiotherapists, almoners, health visitors and occupational therapists are employed on an expanding scale.
Treatment of mental disease is based on one of the largest institutions in the East and here all the modern forms of treatment can be obtained.

The total actual expenditure on Government Medical and Health Services in 1952 amounted to $19,314,454-87 compared with $6-3 million in 1947 and $12-75 million in 1951.

Communications

Kallang Airport, on the southern side of Singapore Island, is the international civil airport for Malaya. The Air Traffic Control Centre based at Kallang serves all aircraft flying within the Singapore Flight Information Region. Regional and internal (Singapore-Malaya-Sarawak-North Borneo) scheduled services are operated by Malayan Airways Limited with a fleet of 11 Dakotas and 3 Beaver aircraft.

Major external international passenger, airmail and cargo services operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways London-Sydney
- British Overseas Airways Corporation London-Sydney
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines London-Hong Kong
- Pan American Airways Incorporated London-Singapore
- Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. Amsterdam-Djakarta
- Garuda Indonesian Airways Manila-New York
- Saigon-Hong Kong
- Djakarta-Borneo
- Medan-Singapore
- Djakarta-Palembang
- Djakarta-Medan
- Djakarta-Calcutta

Indian Airlines Corporation Union of Burma Airways Rangoon-Singapore

A new international airport is under construction at Paya Lebar and is expected to be in operation in 1955. Its cost will be $37½ million. It will have a runway 8,000 feet in length.

The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge. The Railway enters the Colony at the Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour. There are four railway stations in the Island of Singapore.

223·5 miles of bituminous and 8·93 miles of gravelled surface roads are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The control of the port of Singapore is divided between (a) a government and (b) a non-government authority.

(a) The Master Attendant administers all the waters of the port including the Outer and Inner Roads, Keppel Harbour, the Western Anchorages, Telok Ayer Basin, the Singapore, Rochore, Kallang and Geylang rivers and other Colony waters.

(b) The Singapore Harbour Board administers the wharves, docks and premises of the Board situated in Keppel Harbour and a slipway at Tanjong Rhu under the provisions of the Ports Ordinance; also the quays and waterfront premises at Telok Ayer Basin on behalf of the Singapore Government. With the exception of the Chairman (Manager) the members of the Board are appointed by the Governor.

The natural harbours around the southern end of the island still retain their deep water channel capable of taking the largest ships. Wharves comprise:

| Length       | Water depth |
|--------------|-------------|
| West Wharf   | 4,525 ft.   |
| Empire Dock  | 3,522 ft.   |
| Main Wharf   | 3,152 ft.   |
| East Wharf   | 700 ft.     |
| Sheers Wharf | 325 ft.     |

In 1952 cargo handled by the wharves (excluding oil fuel) totalled 4,148,042 tons. In the first half of 1953, 2,600,000 tons were handled. A total of 3,289 ships was worked, the aggregate net registered tonnage being 9,253,222 tons.

The Board maintains tugs for the towing, berthing and unberthing of ships; lighters, a fleet of steel barges and a salvage tug with a range of 5,000 miles.

The Board has first-class facilities for docking and ships' repairs with five dry docks operating. The largest of these is King's Dock, which can accommodate ships up to 45,000 tons, and construction has begun on a parallel Queen's Dock. There are also modern plating shops to carry out hull repairs. Electric current for lighting and power can be supplied to vessels alongside repair berths and in dry docks. Fresh water, steam, hydraulic power and compressed air are all available throughout the dockyards. A modern oxygen plant is also available for ship repair work.

The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, the U.S.A., and other countries in the Far East, and there is a regular freight and passenger service to South Africa via East African ports, and to South America. Several coasting lines are engaged in trade to Indonesia and in conveying transit cargo to Thailand, Borneo and Sarawak.

Broadcasting

Radio Malaya is operated on a pan-Malayan basis by the Department of Broadcasting for the Governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. Programmes in English, Chinese (seven dialects), Malay and Tamil are broadcast over three networks. The total number of hours of broadcasting is 212½ per week, of which 25½ hours are occupied by broadcasts to Schools in English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil.

In Singapore the Department has studios and offices at Caldecott Hill. The main transmitting Station is at Jurong, some 14½ miles from the City, where five short wave transmitters of average power 5 k.W. and three medium wave transmitters of average power 10 k.W. are situated.

In the Federation of Malaya studios and offices are maintained at Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca, which, when the V.H.F. equipment now being installed is operating, will be fully integrated with the Singapore programmes.

The number of current broadcast listening station licences is 39,878 in Singapore and 105,425 in the Federation of Malaya.

A commercial company operates a rediffusion service in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Penang under Government licence, to which there are at present 29,167 subscribers in Singapore and 10,975 in Kuala Lumpur.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief occupations are: transport and communications (including port and lighterage) 52,000,
commerce and finance 83,000, light industries 67,000, agriculture (largely market gardening) 24,000, public administration (central Government, Defence Services and Local Authorities) 58,000. There are 179 registered trade unions, having a membership of 72,599.

Main Products

The main products are remilled rubber, coconut oil, and canned pineapples. The chief exports in addition to these are tin, petroleum products and copra.

Livestock number:—swine 212,830, oxen 4,219, goats 1,321, buffaloes 489. There are also approximately 3½ million head of poultry.

There is extensive fishing in local waters, but the catch is insufficient to meet the demand and is supplemented by imports. In consequence, Government is giving every encouragement to the development of offshore fisheries.

There is no heavy industry in the Colony, but there is an increasing range of light industries. Factories established in the post-war period produce dry batteries, glass and fibre board products, plywood and cane products, plastics, pottery, roofing tiles, metal boxes, canned products and yarn. Factories under construction will produce rope and boot polish. These new factories have supplemented and will supplement the tin smelter, the 13 rubber-milling concerns and the numerous factories producing rubber goods such as footwear, sheeting, tubing, hose and rubber compounds. There are also aluminium works, three pineapple canneries, two factories producing commercial gases, a large paint manufactory, two breweries, two distilleries, a motor assembly plant, biscuit factories, a dozen oil mills (largely concerned with refining copra and palm oil for coconut oil, soap and margarine), six sago factories and numerous brick and other building material factories, boat and ship building and repair companies and general engineering works.

Trade

(See Federation of Malaya for details of pan-Malayan trade.)

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. The Pineapple Joint Industrial Council is concerned with the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruit, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.

Forty-seven co-operative societies were registered as at the 30th November, 1952. They had a membership of 24,860, a working capital of $4,148,000 and reserve funds of $165,490. They include 37 Thrift and Loan, and Thrift, Societies and a Housing Society.
