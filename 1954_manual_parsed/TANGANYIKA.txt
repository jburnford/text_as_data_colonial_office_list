TANGANYIKA

Area

The total area of the territory is 362,688 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of inland water. The land area (in square miles) of the eight Provinces into which the Territory is divided is as follows: Central 36,410, Eastern 42,094, Lake 39,134, Northern 32,165, Southern 55,223, Southern Highlands 45,472, Tanga 13,803 and Western 78,405.

Population

Eight million Africans (1953 estimate), 17,885 Europeans, 56,499 Indians, 3,240 Goans, 13,025 Arabs, 2,060 Somalis, 1,576 coloured, 1,209 others — total non-African population (1952 census) 95,494. Among the Africans some 120 tribes can be distinguished. Some of these number only a few thousand persons, while the largest tribe in the Territory, the Sukuma, represents 12% of the African population and numbers nearly 900,000. Other large tribes in numerical order are the Nyamwezi, Ha, Makonde, Gogo, Haya and Chagga. These seven tribes together comprise 35% of the African population, and with the addition of a further six smaller tribes next in order make just 50% of the total African population.

Geographical Features

The two extremes of topographical relief of the whole continent of Africa lie within the boundaries of the Territory — Kilimanjaro, with a permanent ice-cap rising to 19,565 feet above sea-level, and the deep trough-like depression filled by the waters of Lake Tanganyika, the world’s second deepest lake. Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to the great central plateau, which for the most part maintains an altitude of some 4,000 feet, is sharply defined along both its eastern and western margins by a series of steep-sided and deeply eroded escarpments, and falls sharply to the west to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika 2,534 feet; Nyasa 1,568 feet)* which lie in the trough of the great Rift Valley. Along both the eastern and western escarpment edges the plateau has been elevated to form long but relatively narrow belts of high country, rising in several places to over 7,000 feet. In the west this belt is cut by the valley of the Malagarasi River. This valley provides a drainage outlet to Lake Tanganyika from a large part of the central plateau, and thus extends the Congo-Atlantic drainage basin to within about 350 miles of the Indian Ocean. The escarpment to the east of Lake Nyasa is broken by the Ruhuhu River. The valley of the Ruhuhu is of importance as forming possibly the only practical alignment for a rail connexion between the coast and Lake Nyasa. Approximately half of the two great lakes, Victoria and Tanganyika, lie within the Territory’s borders, and lakes Natron, Manyara, Eyasi (in the north) and Rukwa (in the southwest) account for most of the remainder of the 20,000 square miles of inland water.

Climate

Roughly, three climatic zones can be distinguished:

(i) The coast region and immediately adjoining hinterland — tropical, temperature seldom below 80° during October–May, when the two rainy seasons occur; between June and September it is much cooler. Average temperature 76°; average rainfall 40 inches.

(ii) The central plateau, altitudes 2,000–4,000 feet — prevailing characteristics low humidity, rainfall 20–40 inches annually, mean temperature over 70° with great daily and seasonal variations, sometimes exceeding 30° daily; nights almost invariably cool.

(iii) The semi-temperate regions round the slopes of Kilimanjaro (19,565 feet) and Meru (14,490 feet) to the north of the Territory, the “Winter Highlands” further west, the Usambara and Pare Highlands in the north-east, the Fipa Plateau in the south-west, and the mountainous areas to the north and east of Lake Nyasa (5,000 to 10,000 feet). Frosts at higher altitudes, nights cold.

Generally speaking, the rainfall is low for a tropical country. Except for the northern and middle sections of the coastal belt, where the

*Lake Victoria is 3,717 feet above sea level.
advent of the rain is dependent on the south-east and the north-east monsoon currents, and the areas around Lake Victoria and the north of Lake Nyasa—where there are two distinct rainy seasons—the greater part of the Territory has generally a one-season rainfall, beginning in November or December and continuing more or less unbrokenly to the end of April or May.

**History**

The country now known as Tanganyika came under German influence largely through the initiative of Dr. Karl Peters. In 1884 he journeyed into the interior and concluded twelve treaties with chiefs whose chiefdoms were then declared to be German territory. In 1885 the land he had acquired was placed under the protection of the Imperial German Government. A ten-mile belt along the coast was regarded as belonging to Zanzibar, but in 1888 Germany acquired the right of collecting duties on the coast and in 1890 took over the coastal strip on payment of £200,000 to the Sultan of Zanzibar. For some time after their acquisition of the territory the Germans were engaged in quelling risings, and in 1905 there broke out a serious rebellion, known as the "maji-maji" rising, in the southern areas and extending from Lake Nyasa in the interior to Kilwa on the coast.

Soon after the outbreak of the 1914–18 war clashes took place between British and German forces on the northern frontier of the Territory, but the serious attempt to occupy the country did not begin until 1916. By the end of that year all the country north of the Central Railway was occupied by British or Belgian forces and a provisional Civil Administration was established for that area on the 1st January, 1917. In November 1917 the German forces were driven across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese East Africa and the occupation of the whole of the Territory was then completed. By the Treaty of Peace with Germany, signed at Versailles in 1919, Germany renounced in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights over her overseas possessions, including her East African colony. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that His Britannic Majesty should exercise a mandate to administer this former German colony, except for the areas of Ruanda and Urundi, for which the mandate was given to the Belgian Government. In 1920 the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Territory was constituted. Since then the administration of the Territory has continued to be carried out under the terms of the Mandate until the establishment of the Trusteeship System under the Charter of the United Nations.

**Constitution**

The basis of the administration of the Territory in international constitutional law is the Trusteeship Agreement approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1946. The basis of the administration in demotic constitutional law is in Orders in Council under the United Kingdom Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890.

The Territory is administered by the Governor assisted by an Executive Council consisting of *ex officio*, nominated official and unofficial members. The function of this Council is to advise the Governor on all matters which the law prescribes should be dealt with by the Governor in Council and on such other matters as he may see fit to refer to the Council. If in any matter the Governor takes action contrary to the advice of the Council, he must report the circumstances to the Secretary of State, giving the grounds and reasons for his action.

The Legislative Council, as at present constituted, consists of a Speaker, 15 *ex officio* and nominated official members and 14 unofficial members.

**Land Policy**

All public lands and all rights over them are under the control of and subject to the disposition of the Governor to be held and administered for the use and common benefit, direct or indirect, of the natives of the territory and no title to the occupation and use of any such lands is valid without the consent of the Governor who, in exercise of his powers, is obliged to have regard to the customary laws and customs of the indigenous inhabitants. Freehold title over public land may not be created or granted except in giving effect to any contract or undertaking by the former German Government or in substitution thereof. The Governor may make grants of rights of occupancy over public land to both native and non-native persons for terms not exceeding 99 years, demand a rental and revise the rental at stated intervals.

Subject to the foregoing, non-African utilization of land, by suitably selected persons and under conditions of proper Government control is encouraged as being likely to conduce to the economic development of the territory.

**Taxation**

The tax system includes indirect taxation in the form of import, export and excise duties, stamp duties, and miscellaneous licence fees. Import duties continue to represent the largest single item in the Territory's revenue, considerably exceeding the total collection from all forms of direct taxation.

Particulars of direct taxation are set out below.

(a) **Native House and Poll Tax.** House tax is payable in respect of every "native dwelling"; poll tax by every able-bodied male member of the indigenous population of the age of 18 and over who is not liable for house tax, other than those specifically exempted.

(b) **Non-Native Poll Tax** is payable by all males of the age of 18 and over who are not liable for taxes leviable under the native tax laws; it is graded in relation to individual incomes.

(c) **Non-Native Education Tax** is payable by every male non-native over 18 resident in the Territory, and assessed on poll tax payable.

(d) **Municipal House Tax** is levied on owners of houses in townships, not including native dwellings, at rates not exceeding 15% of the...
net annual value of the house. The tax is not normally leviable in those townships where local rates are in force.

(e) Estate Duty is payable at graduated rates on any deceased estate of a value exceeding £100.

(f) Income Tax.—Resident individuals pay Shs. 1/50 on each £ of the first £400 of chargeable income; where this exceeds £400, upon the whole chargeable income at the rate of Shs. 1/50 in the £ with the addition of one-eighth of a cent for every £ of chargeable income in excess of £400 up to a total of £1,600, at which point the rate is Shs. 3/– in the £. On chargeable income in excess of £1,600 the rate is Shs. 5/– in the £. Where the total income exceeds £2,000 a surtax is payable of Sh. –/25 cents, increasing by one-eighth of a cent up to a total income of £3,500, and thereafter by one-twentieth of a cent up to a maximum rate of surtax of Shs. 9/–.

Non-resident individuals pay at the rate of Shs. 2/– where chargeable income does not exceed £800. Where it exceeds £800 the rate is the same as for residents.

The income of individuals is subject to their personal allowances.

Limited companies pay at the rate of Shs. 5/– in the £.

† Approved estimates.

In 1953 it was estimated that the sum of £5 million would be received from Customs and excise duties, £5½ million from licences and taxes and £4½ million on Development Plan Account. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were £4½ million on Development Plan Account, £1½ million Public Works, £1½ million Education, over £1 million Medical Services, with over £600,000 for East Africa High Commission, Miscellaneous Services, Police, Provincial Administration, and between £400,000 and £600,000 for Pension Gratuities, Agriculture and Veterinary.

The Public Debt at 31st December, 1952, amounted to £5,735,926 (approximately 14s. 5d. per head of population) and comprised:

- Loans from Imperial Funds: £995,926
- Guaranteed Loan, 1952-72: £500,000
- Barclays Overseas Development Corporation Loan: £210,000
- Inscribed Stock, 1970-73: £4,030,000

£5,735,926

Currency

This is issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The British East Africa shilling is the standard coin. Subsidiary coins are of the following denominations: 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents and 50 cents. There are 100 cents to the shilling. Currency notes are issued in the following denominations: Sh. 5/-, Sh. 10/-, Sh. 20/-, Sh. 100/-, Sh. 200/- and Sh. 1,000/-.

Development Plans

There has been a sustained increase in development from 1948 onwards, as is indicated by the following expenditure figures—1948, £851,000; 1949, £1,687,000; 1950, £3,438,000; 1951, £3,830,000; 1952, £4,989,000.

Tanganyika received an allocation of £5,250,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. In 1953 the plan was revised and it is now proposed to spend about £11½ million between 1953 and 1956. The money is to be found from the following sources:

- Colonial Development and Welfare Territorial Grant: £2,339,000
- Other Colonial Development and Welfare, Economic Co-operation Administration Grants: £307,000
- Tanganyika Revenue: £3,549,000
- Loan Funds: £4,414,000

This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- Basic Services: £7,746,000 (67%)
- Social Services: £1,477,000 (13%)
- Productive Services: £2,386,000 (20%)

Basic services—19% of the total will be spent on buildings and 48% on roads.

Social Services—63% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 27% on general education.

Productive Services—54% of the total will be spent on agriculture.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation is considering, as a long term measure, the exploitation of the proved coalfields in Songea District. The Corporation’s wattle plantations in Njombe District now extend over 9,000 acres. In the gold and tin mines acquired by it in Musoma and Bukoba surveys and tests are being carried out to make possible systematic exploitation.

The modified programme being pursued by the Overseas Food Corporation lays stress on such crops as velvet beans, soya beans, millet and tobacco in addition to groundnuts.

The D’Arcy Exploration Company jointly with the Shell Overseas Exploration Company is prospecting for oil in the coastal belt under an exclusive prospecting licence.

Work on deep-water berths at Dar es Salaam and Mtwara, and on the new Southern Province railway, is continuing.

Education

Facilities for higher education are provided by the University College of Makerere at Kampala in Uganda. African students from Tanganyika who qualify for entrance to Makerere at present are required to pay fees of only £40 towards the cost of tuition and residence at the College, the balance being met from Government funds;
provision exists for the remission of these fees in cases of need. The number of students in residence from Tanganyika in 1952 was 57. The present target is for 200 students from Tanganyika to attend Makerere in 1956. At the end of 1952 there were six Africans at Universities and four attending co-operative courses in the United Kingdom. About 59 Asians from Tanganyika are studying in the United Kingdom.

An increasing number of Africans are completing the full Secondary school course and 64 passed the Cambridge School Certificate Examination in 1952. The system of African education has been revised under the Ten-Year Plan for African Education which provides for three stages up to the secondary level; the Primary school covers Standards I-IV; the Middle school V-VIII and the Secondary school IX-XII inclusive. It is hoped that there will be, by 1956, 310,000 Primary pupils, 32,100 Middle school pupils and 3,720 Secondary pupils. One trade school accommodating 500 pupils is already in being and the building of a second is in hand. The sum of £50,000 has been contributed to the Royal Technical College of East Africa at Nairobi which is intended to provide advanced technical training for East African students of all races.

Facilities for European, Indian and other non-native education are provided by the European and Indian Education Authorities and by the Advisory Committee on other Non-native (including Goan) Education. Each of these Authorities has its own fund to which Government makes a substantial contribution annually. Six Government Primary schools, one with a Secondary school attached, 11 assisted schools and five unassisted schools together with a Government Correspondence School give education in all to 1,775 European pupils; 14,513 Indian pupils are attending one Government Primary school and 61 assisted Primary schools, and 3,266 Indians are receiving secondary education at two Government schools and 25 assisted schools.

Expenditure on educational services during 1952 amounted to approximately £2,314,855, of which £210,722 was contributed from Development Funds and approximately £274,132 by Native Authorities. In 1935 the total expenditure was £81,100.

Health

There are 443 out-patient dispensaries maintained by Native Authorities, ten by Government, 57 by grant-earning missions and 291 by private bodies and industry. The Native Authorities maintain 22 maternity and child health clinics, Government 18 and missions 53. There are 16 major leprosaria of which some are maintained by Government and some by grant-aided missions. Government, missions and Industrial concerns maintain a total of 177 hospitals and bedded dispensaries with 9,781 beds. During 1952 171,364 in-patients and 4,547,370 out-patients were treated at Government and mission hospitals and dispensaries, and at Native Authority dispensaries.

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1952 was £1,138,647, of which £103,055 was contributed from Development Funds for capital expenditure on medical buildings. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £193,930. These figures exclude such items as medical building works provided for in the Public Works estimates and public health measures undertaken by the various township authorities or the expenditure on medical services by industry and voluntary agencies.

Communications

There are 21 scheduled aerodromes of which three—Dar es Salaam, Tabora and Lindi—are capable of taking large aircraft in all weathers. Internal air transport is conducted by the East African Airways Corporation. The Corporation operates a network of scheduled services connecting the main administrative and commercial centres of Tanganyika, Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. The Central African Airways Corporation operates services between Nairobi and Southern Rhodesia. Small charter aircraft are based at Dar es Salaam, Mbeya and Bukoba. Meteorological services are available and are controlled by the East African Meteorological Department with a territorial office in Dar es Salaam. External services connect with the services of the East African and Central African Airways Corporations. B.O.A.C. operates a Hermes service one a week between Dar es Salaam and London.

The railways of the Territory are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission").

There are 545 miles of roads in townships, 50 in other settlements, 3,243 miles of main roads, 3,688 miles of Grade A District roads, 10,423 miles of Grade B District roads and approximately 8,000 miles of village roads.

Six shipping lines operate services from and to Europe and South Africa, two lines operate services to India and South Africa, one line operates to Portuguese East Africa, two lines operate from Europe to and from Indonesia, five lines operate services to and from the United States of America and one line to and from France and Madagascar. Coastal services between Tanganyika, Kenya and Zanzibar are operated by six lines.

Passenger and freight services are operated on Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Administration and on Lake Nyasa by Nyasaland Railways Ltd. These steamer services connect the railways of Tanganyika with those of Kenya and Uganda and the transport systems of the Belgian Congo, Ruanda Urundi and Northern Rhodesia.

Broadcasting

Experimental broadcasting, with three ½ kW transmitters sited at Dar es Salaam, is now reaching the end of the first phase, and the arrival of a 20 kW transmitter and the building of a new Broadcasting Station are planned for the middle of 1954. This will be a Government project financed largely from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, and will provide effective coverage for the whole territory. Rediffusion experiments have been conducted by Government in Dar es Salaam and it is proposed to continue and develop this service, mainly in the towns. There is at present a "fee nil" licence in Tanganyika and it is not possible to estimate the number of listeners.

Principal Occupations

Most of the self-employed indigenous inhabitants are engaged in agriculture. The numbers of
African adult males employed (at a census on 31st July, 1952) are classified in the following major industrial groups:

There is extensive fishing in inland and coastal waters and fish-farming is being actively encouraged.

The principal minerals exported in 1951 and 1952 were gold (unrefined bullion), diamonds, tin concentrates, lead concentrates, mica (sheet, ground and waste), salt and tungsten concentrates.

There were in 1952, 2,042 premises, including all establishments covered by the definition of factories under the Factories Ordinance, employing 50,582 persons 95% of whom were Africans. The industries employing most labour were sisal and sansevieria processing (202 premises), sawmilling (69), general woodworking, including carpentry, joinery and cabinet making (180), tailoring and dressmaking (572), and motor vehicle repairs (114). Among the industries are 39 manufacturing soap, 2 sugar, 3 curing tobacco, 59 pulping coffee, 31 cotton ginning, 17 generating electricity and 199 milling flour, oil and rice.
