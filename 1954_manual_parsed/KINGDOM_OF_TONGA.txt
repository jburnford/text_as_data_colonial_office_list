KINGDOM OF TONGA

Area
269 square miles, including inland waters; Tongatapu, the largest island, 99·2 square miles.

Population
This was estimated at the end of 1952 to number 50,980, of whom over 48,000 are Tongans.

Geographical Features
There are three main groups of islands: Vava'u, Ha'apai and Tongatapu. The islands on the eastern side are of coral formation while the chain on the west are volcanic. There are active volcanoes on four of the islands.

Climate
The climate is healthy, though hot and humid from January to March; during the rest of the year, pleasantly cool. The mean annual temperature is 73°; the mean annual rainfall 70 inches on Tongatapu, 110 inches on Vava'u.

The principal town is Nuku'alofa on Tongatapu (capital); population 5,500.

History
During the first half of the nineteenth century the islands were the scenes of civil wars. These were finally checked during the reign of King George Tupou I (1845–93) who had by conquest gathered all power in his own hands.

In 1826 Wesleyan missionaries landed on Tonga and by the middle of the century practically all the chiefs and people had embraced Christianity. Not until the last decade of the century, however, were questions regarding freedom of worship and the relationship of Church and State peaceably settled. In 1900, by a Treaty of Friendship and Protection, Tonga became a British Protected State, while remaining self-governing.

Constitution
The present constitution is based, with relatively little amendment, on that granted in 1875 by King George Tupou I. It provides for a Government consisting of the Sovereign (at present Queen Salote Tupou, G.C.V.O., G.B.E.) a Privy Council and Cabinet, a Legislative Assembly and a Judiciary. The Legislative Assembly consists of the Premier and Ministers of the Crown (including the Governors of Vava'u and Ha'apai) seven representatives of the nobles elected by their peers, and seven representatives of the people elected by popular franchise, every male Tongan of 21 years of age who pays taxes and can read and write being qualified to vote. Elections are held every three years. The President of the Legislative Assembly is the Speaker, appointed by the Sovereign. The courts consist of a Supreme Court, a Magistrate's Court and a Land Court. By Order in Council No. 458 of 1952 the responsibilities of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in respect of the Kingdom of Tonga were transferred with effect from the 1st April, 1952, to the Governor of Fiji who acts through Her Britannic Majesty's Consul and Agent in Tonga. British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for over two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga courts. In other respects they are for the time being subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific but his jurisdiction will be transferred to the Supreme Court of Fiji in due course, as provided by the Order in Council referred to above.

Land
Every male Tongan on reaching the taxable age of 16 years is entitled to 8½ acres of land for cultivation in addition to a small village allotment for his dwelling.

Land may not be leased to non-Tongans without the consent of the Government. Immigrant settlement is not encouraged owing to the increasing shortage of land available for tax allotments and local purposes.

Taxation
For the allotments described in the preceding paragraph an annual tax of 8s. a year is paid and in addition an annual tax of 32s., for which free education, medical, hospital and dental treatment are provided. Indirect taxation includes import duties (general tariff 33½% ad valorem, British preferential tariff 15½% ad valorem) and a Port and Customs Service tax on imports of 5%. There is also an export duty on copra of £8 2s. 6d. per ton.

The Tonga £ has the same official exchange value as the Australian £. The note issue is of denominations of £5, £1, 10s. and 4s.; the main tender status coinage in use is Australian, though United Kingdom, New Zealand and Fiji coins are also in circulation.
Education

There are 133 primary schools (70 State schools and the remainder run by Missions); secondary education is provided by two Government and five Mission Colleges. There is a training school for Government and Mission primary school teachers. In 1952 the total attendance at primary schools was 10,835; at secondary schools approximately 2,178. Government expenditure on education (exclusive of buildings and building maintenance) amounted to £34,996 in 1952-53 compared with £5,835 in 1934-35.

Health

The Government of Tonga Medical Department operates three public hospitals, two subsidiary hospitals and a number of dispensaries. In 1951, 1,364 in-patients and 25,908 out-patients were treated. Government expenditure on medical services (exclusive of buildings and building maintenance) amounted to £51,050 in 1952-53 as compared with £7,280 in 1934-35.

Communications

There is a first-class aerodrome on the island of Tongatapu, and limited seaplane facilities at Nuku'alofa and Vava'u harbours. Tasman Empire Airways Limited commenced operating a charter flying boat service between Fiji and Tonga on the 12th August, 1953.

There are approximately 60 miles of metalled road in Tongatapu and 18 miles in Vava'u suitable for motor traffic. There are 150 miles of graded earth roads which are only usable by motor traffic in dry weather.

The chief ports, which are also ports of entry, are Nuku'alofa and Vava'u. In 1951 Nuku'alofa entered 37,125 and cleared 36,982 tons of shipping, and Vava'u entered 27,449 and cleared 17,294 tons of shipping. A regular monthly passenger and cargo service from New Zealand via Fiji is maintained by the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand. Regular cargo services are maintained by vessels of the Bank Line and the Union Steam Ship Company. The former lift copra and the latter discharge general cargo from Australia and United Kingdom transhipment cargo from Fiji. Occasional vessels call to discharge timber from Canada or oil from Singapore.

Sea communication within the group is maintained by Government auxiliary vessels, and sailing vessels.

There are no local broadcasting services.

Principal Occupations

Tonga is essentially an agricultural country, and, in general, a land of peasant proprietors. The recruitment and employment of labour may, therefore, be said not to exist. A minute proportion of the population seek employment in the Government Services, in the stores and European leaseholds.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are coconuts, bananas, kumalas, yams, taro, cassava, groundnuts, candlenuts, maize and fungus. In 1952, 16,500 tons of copra and 29,008 cases of bananas were exported.

Livestock number (rough estimate): horses 6,250, cattle 1,680, goats 1,820, pigs 20,800.

Limited areas of forest lands are found in the islands of 'Eua and Vava'u, but there are no exports of timber.

There is an abundance of fish in the waters of the Group which provides a constant fish diet for the inhabitants.

There are no manufactures in Tonga, apart from one minor industry which is in the experimental stage. This is the expressing of juices from citrus, pineapple and passion fruits.
