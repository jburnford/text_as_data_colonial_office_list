WESTERN PACIFIC HIGH COMMISSION

(Administrative headquarters: Honiara, British Solomon Islands.)

The office of High Commissioner for the Western Pacific was created by the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877. The High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not administered by Australia, New Zealand, Fiji or any other civilized power. By the Pacific Order in Council of 1893 the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the High Commissioner's jurisdiction also extends to the New Hebrides, and the Banks and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate; but a contribution is paid from Imperial Funds in respect of expenses of the British Services in the New Hebrides.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners; and in it is vested all Her Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands. The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner. Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of Her Majesty. A Judicial Commissioner's Court has powers similar to those of the superior courts of England; and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in common law, equity and bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards. With some few exceptions, an appeal against all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court lies to a Judicial Commissioner. In addition to other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons who endanger the peace of the islands.

By Orders in Council of 1952 the High Commissioner's responsibilities in respect of the Kingdom of Tonga and the Island of Pitcairn were transferred to the Governor of Fiji with effect from the 1st April, 1952.

The groups at present under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (including the Phoenix and Northern Line Islands groups).
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Central and Southern Line Islands.

Particulars of these are given below.

The posts of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific and the Governor of Fiji, which for many years had been held conjointly, were separated on the retirement of Sir Brian Freeston in 1952; and arrangements were made to transfer the Headquarters of the Western Pacific from Suva, where they had been since the creation of the post of High Commissioner (except for the period when Sir Arthur Gordon combined the posts of Governor of New Zealand and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific) to Honiara in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The High Commissioner established his headquarters at Honiara on 1st January, 1953, and took over responsibility for the direct administration of the Protectorate from the Acting Resident Commissioner on the same date.

BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE

Area

The Protectorate is enclosed within an area of approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,500 square miles are land.

Population

The estimate in 1952 was:
- Europeans ... ... ... 500
- Melanesians ... ... ... 95,000
- Polynesians ... ... ... 4,350
- Chinese ... ... ... 300

100,150

Geographical Features

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands situated between the parallels of 5° and 12° 30' S., and the meridians of 155° and 170° E. longitude and includes the islands of Guadalcanal, Malaita, San Cristobal, New Georgia, Ysabel, Choiseul, Mono (or Treasury), Vella Lavella, Ranongga, Gizo, Rendova, Russell, Florida, Rennell, and numerous small islands, including the Lord Howe Group or Ongtong Java, the Santa Cruz Islands, Tikopia, Mitre Islands and the Duff and Reef Groups.

Climate

This is not regarded as unhealthy. The introduction of modern anti-malarial drugs has considerably reduced the dangers of this disease. The seasons are generally well defined by trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the minimum temperatures are recorded. The highest mean and maximum temperatures and the highest rainfall are, as a rule, recorded in the months in the north-west season from November to April.

Principal Town

Honiara, the capital, has a native population of 1,600. Europeans number 250, Chinese 150.

History

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. In 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz group and the north-west coastline of the island of Malaita. From this time many Europeans visited the group and British ships of war paid periodical visits.

Between 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the proclamation in 1893 of the British protectorate over the southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristobal, the New Georgia group and its dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50. In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz group, including Utupua, Tikopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona were added to the Protectorate. In 1900 the northern islands (Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits south and south-west of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ongtong Java) were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

In 1942 Japanese troops invaded the islands. Most of the non-native population had been evacuated to Australia but the Resident Commissioner and a number of his officers remained to continue the Administration as far as possible. The Japanese occupied the central Solomons and were driven back by the Allies only after violent air, sea and land battles in 1942 and 1943; they were not completely dislodged from the north-western extremity of the Protectorate until the surrender of Japan. The effect upon the population of contact with the very large numbers of Allied servicemen in occupation of the islands and based there for operations further afield, was great and disruption of native life was inevitable; the effects are still being felt in many ways.

An outstanding feature of the war and the enemy invasion of the territory was the great loyalty of the native people to their British connexion and to the Allied cause generally.

Constitution

The Protectorate is administered directly by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of Queen's Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. There is an Advisory Council, consisting of official, non-official and native members.

Land Policy

A Special Lands Commissioner has been appointed to conduct a survey and formulate a revised lands policy for the Protectorate.

Taxation

Income Tax is levied at the rate of 1s. 3d. increased by '012d. for every £ of chargeable income up to £5,000, and 6s. 3d. on every £ of chargeable income over £5,000. When the chargeable income of any person other than a company exceeds £1,500 a surtax is levied at the rate of 1s. 3d. per £ on incomes between £1,500 and £3,000, 2s. 6d. per £ on incomes between £3,000 and £5,000 and on a sliding scale rising to 10s. 0d. per £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £50,000. Residential tax of £2 per annum is levied on all non-native adult males. Natives pay tax at rates of 5s., 10s., 12s. and £1 per annum, according to areas in which they reside.

Customs duties represent the chief source of revenue from indirect taxation.

Public Finance

| Year     | Revenue (£A) | Expenditure (£A) |

| 1953     | 717,034*    | 717,034*         |

* Revised Estimate.

The above figures include Colonial Development and Welfare grants and loans from Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.

It is estimated that in 1953 61% of ordinary revenue was derived from Customs duty, and 17% from direct taxation. In the same year, the main heads of ordinary expenditure were:

- Medical Department: 12%
- Works (Extraordinary): 25%
- Marine Transport: 9%

There is no Public Debt in the Protectorate.

Currency

The currency is Australian. This is interchangeable with sterling at £Stg.1 = £A.1 5s.

Development Plans

The most important development schemes are:

- Central Hospital, Honiara, estimated cost: £96,940
- Guadalcanal Demonstration Farm, estimated cost: £38,749
- Geological Survey, estimated cost: £25,938

In December, 1952, a Colonial Development and Welfare research grant of £8,650 was approved as part of a total requirement of £11,650 for an entomological research scheme. The balance of £3,000 is being contributed from British Solomon Islands Copra Board funds. The primary object is to determine how best to deal with the damaging effects of pests which have caused a serious decline in the output of copra. Proposals to introduce cocoa as a second main crop in the Protectorate culminated in the provision of a grant of £13,375 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds to be spent over a five-year period.

Education is still largely in the hands of the Missions. Following the promulgation of the new Education Regulations, Government subsidies will be paid to Missions complying with certain qualifications; the estimated subsidy to Mission schools in 1954 is £6,000. In 1953 there were four Government Primary schools and one Secondary boarding school, all on the island of Malaita. Further development of Government schools is planned. Expenditure on education, exclusive of Colonial Development and Welfare Fund grants, was £14,180 in 1953, compared with £1,000 in 1939.
Health

The estimated expenditure of the Medical Department during 1953 was £82,317 (including expenditure on the Tetere Leper Settlement, Guadalcanal). There are Government hospitals at Honiara (92 beds), Auki (50 beds) and Gizo (40 beds). That at Honiara is to be rebuilt as soon as possible.

Communications

The airfields used by commercial aircraft are at Honiara, Guadalcanal, at Renard Airstrip in the Russell Islands and Barakoma Airfield on the island of Vella Lavella. Qantas Empire Airways operate a weekly service via Port Moresby and Lae from Sydney.

There are about 20 miles of pressed coral surface road extending east and west of Honiara.

Messrs. Burns Philp and Company Limited operate a shipping service to the Protectorate from Sydney. Bank Line vessels under charter to the British Ministry of Food call irregularly to load copra. The chief ports in the Protectorate are Honiara, Tulagi, Yandina and Gizo. The Protectorate Government owns and operates 12 small vessels for inter-island communications and administrative and medical touring. The Government Trade Scheme owns two vessels, and there is an ever-increasing number of privately owned vessels in the Protectorate.

Broadcasting

A daily broadcasting service from the Government Radio Station, VQO Honiara, was inaugurated in 1952 on a wavelength of 1,030 kilocycles. There are 141 licence holders in the Protectorate.

Principal Occupations

Most of the indigenous population is engaged in agriculture, either in village gardens or in the copra industry. They are under no economic necessity to work for wages. In December 1951 the total number employed was estimated at 4,097, 2,165 of whom were copra workers.

The Main Crops and Products are coconuts, yams, sweet potatoes, taro, nali nut, tapioca, bananas, pineapple and copra. A rough estimate of the livestock population is 10,000 pigs, 3,500 cattle, 300 goats, 75 horses.

Trade

The chief export is copra which, except for 4,200 tons exported annually to Australia, is shipped to the United Kingdom. Total exports in 1952 were 12,925 tons, valued at £A.973,091.

| Imports | Exports |

| 1952    | 1,087,329 | 1,506,343 |

(Including bullion and specie.)

Imports are mainly foodstuffs and trade goods from Australia.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate Copra Board, which has agents at the main ports, purchases all copra from producers and sells under contract to the Ministry of Food. No formal co-operative societies have as yet been established but native Solomon Islands commercial activity is very largely based on the informal co-operation which is such an inherent part of native social custom, and it is expected that in the near future there will be a rapid extension of the principle of co-operation.

GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY

Area

The area is approximately 369 square miles, comprising 37 islands spread over more than 2,000,000 square miles of water.

Population was 36,000 at the 1947 census Gilberts 27,824; Ellice 4,487; Phoenix 984; Northern Line 469; Ocean 2,060. By races the population comprises: Micronesians 29,923; Polynesians 5,066; others, including Europeans, 1,011.

Geographical Features

With the exception of Ocean Island (which is an atoll raised by volcanic action some 200 feet above its original level) the islands are all coral atolls, some with lagoons and some without. There are 16 atolls in the Gilbert Group, nine in the Ellice, eight in the Phoenix and three in the Northern Line Islands.

Climate

The driest months are August to October and the wettest December to February, when northeasterly and westerly storms occur. The southern Gilberts, Phoenix and Christmas Island (Line) suffer from periodic droughts which have an approximate cycle of seven years. Rainfall varies from 100 inches annually in the northern Gilberts through 40 inches in the southern up to 120 inches in the Ellice Islands. In the Phoenix Islands the average rainfall is about 50 inches and in the Line from 30 inches on Christmas Island up to 150 on Washington. The day temperature varies between 80° and 90° throughout the year and the minimum night temperature is about 70°. The trade winds keep the air cool and humidity is not high, except during the rainy season.

* For Secretariat see under Western Pacific High Commission.
Principal Islands

The principal islands and their populations at the 1947 census are:

- Ocean Island—District Headquarters 2,060
- Tarawa—Colony and District Headquarters, Gilbert Islands 3,582
- Funafuti—District Headquarters, Ellice Islands 528
- Canton Island—District Headquarters, Phoenix Islands 81
- Fanning Island—District Headquarters, Line Islands 259

History

The Gilbert and Ellice groups were brought under the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in 1877 and a Protectorate was established in 1892 when H.M.S. Royalist visited them. Ocean Island was annexed in 1900, and in 1915 the Gilbert and Ellice Islands were annexed by an Order in Council of 10th November. The Order came into effect on 12th January, 1916, from which date the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate became a Colony. In the same year the boundaries of the Colony were extended to include Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands; in 1917 Christmas Island; and in 1937 the Phoenix Islands.

Constitution and Administration

Local governments are established on islands with indigenous populations in the Gilbert, Ellice and Phoenix groups. They are supervised by District Officers responsible through the Resident Commissioner to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. These governments, under a constitution introduced in 1941, consist of a representative Council with an official majority which exercises minor legislative and executive authority; a Court with criminal and civil jurisdiction over persons of pure and mixed Pacific Islands extraction; and a Lands Court which operates customary law under the supervision of a Lands Commission. Because of the scattered nature of the territory, the local governments have considerable freedom from direct supervision. Non-native residents of the Colony are subject to Colony and English law enforceable in the High Commissioner’s Court established under the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

Land Policy

The alienation of land to non-natives is forbidden and leases may not be taken out without the consent of the Resident Commissioner or, if the lease is to be for a period in excess of 99 years or for an area exceeding five acres, without the approval of the High Commissioner. Very little land is owned by non-natives (acquired before annexation) or by the Crown.

Taxation

Two forms of direct taxation are in force: income tax and landowners tax. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for a basic tax of 1s. 3d. in the £ plus as many times .012d. as there are £’s of taxable income until, at £5,000, the maximum rate of 6s. 3d. in the £ is reached. The statutory exemption is £200; allowances are made for wife, children, etc. Surtax is payable on income over £1,500, starting at 1s. 3d. in the £. Insurance companies pay 9d. in the £ on chargeable income; shipping companies 4½d.; other companies 7½d.

Landowners tax is paid by all landowners and is based upon land productivity and size.

Import duties, royalties on phosphates and export (copra) duties are the other main forms of taxation.

(a) Ordinary revenue.
(b) Excluding expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

It is estimated that in 1953 46% of ordinary revenue was derived from import and export duties, 19% from phosphate royalties and 8% from direct taxation. In the same year the (estimated) main heads of expenditure were:

- Medical 15%
- Works (reconstruction) 14%
- Marine Transport 12%
- Works 9%

Currency

Australian currency is used in the Colony. Exchange rates fixed in 1949 are:

- £1 Sterling = £A.1 5s. 0d.
- £1 New Zealand = £A.1 5s. 0d.
- £1 Fiji = £A.1 2s. 7d.

Development

The estimated expenditure for 1953 under Colonial Development and Welfare grants was £61,689. Of this total £40,000 has been approved for school construction; £7,750 has been provided for erection of navigational aids; £200 for emigration to Phoenix Group; £2,500 for overseas training of Colony students; £300 for construction of staff quarters at Ocean Island School; £6,403 for Lands settlement; £2,000 for training of Medical students; £100 for Tuberculosis Survey; £60 for Meteorological Services; £450 for construction of Nanumanga seawall; and £1,924 for co-operative societies development.

Education

At 31st December, 1952, there were 7,977 children between the ages of 7 and 16 receiving primary education. Ninety-four pupils were at teacher-training centres. At 31st August, 1953, there were 10 Primary schools maintained from Colonial and Local Government funds and 253 grant-aided. The King George V Secondary School at Tarawa was opened in 1953 after reconstruction. A roll of 60 boys is to be increased to 120-150 in due course. Seventeen students were taking various post-primary and professional courses in Fiji and New Zealand during 1952, the bulk of the funds being provided by a Colonial Development and Welfare grant. Government expenditure on Education in 1951 was £9,506 compared with £3,849 in 1935–36. The 1954 estimate is £19,337.

* Canton Island is under joint Anglo-American administration and is an international airport.
† Fanning Island has a relay station on the trans-Pacific cable operated by Cable and Wireless Limited.
Health

Total expenditure on health services, excluding building and maintenance and overseas training, during 1951 was £38,374 compared with £8,848 in 1935-36. The 1954 estimate is £52,372. Each island has its hospital supervised by a resident Dresser; Government Medical Officers and Assistant Medical Practitioners tour regularly. In-patients admitted to Government hospitals during 1951 numbered 4,695. Out-patient attendances were 117,767. Yaws is widespread and tuberculosis, influenza and dysentery occur on most islands.

Communications

There is an international airport at Canton Island; scheduled landings averaged over 60 a month during 1951. The emergency landing-strip at Tarawa is used irregularly; flying-boats occasionally visit Tarawa and can land at several other lagoon islands.

Communications in the Colony are mainly marine; the Colony Government operates three small inter-island vessels; the Colony Wholesale Society, two; the Missions, three. Communications overseas are normally by these vessels to Ocean Island; each month several vessels owned or chartered by the British Phosphate Commissioners arrive at Ocean Island from, or leave for, Australia or New Zealand. At irregular intervals one of the inter-island vessels visits Fiji and two or three times a year a ship arrives from Fiji en route for the United Kingdom to load copra at Tarawa and in the Line Islands.

The Government operates 26 radio transmitting and receiving stations to pass messages within the Colony, to ships and to Fiji.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in copra production. Estimated numbers in other occupations (1951) are: Government service 1,100 including 550 part-time Native (local) Government officials; phosphate mining 1,200; commerce 500.

Main Crops and Products

Apart from copra production there is no other crop of commercial value. Sea fishing is excellent but on a small scale. Phosphate of lime is mined at Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners.

THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONDOMINIUM OF THE NEW HEBRIDES

Area

The area, including the Banks and Torres Islands, is estimated at 5,700 square miles.

Population

The native population is composed of approximately 48,000 Melanesians, with an admixture of Polynesian blood in certain parts of the group. The non-native population in December, 1952, included 372 British Nationals, 1,311 French Nationals and 2,406 others (of whom the majority are Vietnamese, Wallisians and Chinese introduced to provide labour).

The islands are of coral and volcanic formation, with active volcanoes on Tanna, Lopevi and Ambrym. They are almost without exception mountainous, Santo Peak and Tabwebesana on Santo rising to over 6,000 feet, but narrow, cultivable coastal strips are generally present.

Climate

The rather enervating climate is generally classed as unhealthy owing to the prevalence of malaria, but conditions of living, particularly in the town of Vila, have improved greatly in recent years. The year is divided into two fairly distinct seasons, the hot and wet season, during which cyclones may occur, from November to April, and the dry and cool season of the south-east trade winds from May to October. Temperatures at Vila vary between 56° and 94°, and average rainfall ranges from about 45 inches in the south to about 250 inches in the north with a mean figure of 74 inches for Vila.
Principal Town

The only town in the group is Vila, the Administrative Headquarters, with a population of 1,200.

History

The New Hebrides were discovered by the Spanish explorer, de Quirós in 1606. The next mention came from the French navigator Bougainville in 1768, and in 1774 Captain Cook visited and charted the greater part of the chain of islands comprising the group. Other early visitors were Laperouse, who is believed to have passed through in 1788, and D'Entrecasteaux who came in search of Laperouse in 1793. In this same year the sighting of the Banks Islands was recorded by Captain Bligh in the course of his open boat voyage to Timor after the mutiny on the Bounty. Last century, before any national eyes were turned on the New Hebrides, a number of British and French missionaries, planters and traders had established themselves, and in 1887, by the Anglo-French Convention of 16th November, the two nations appointed a Joint Naval Commission charged with the protection in the New Hebrides of the lives and properties of the subjects of England and France.

In 1902 Deputy Resident Commissioners were appointed and took up residence in the Territory, and in February 1906 an Anglo-French conference took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for settlement of land claims and for an arrangement to end the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. This was confirmed on 20th October, 1906.

The New Hebrides became an important allied base during the Second World War and the islands of Efate and Santo were occupied by large garrisons, mainly of United States troops, in the early stages of the offensive against the Japanese.

Land Policy

As the New Hebrides is not a territorial possession of either power concerned, there are no Crown lands or their equivalent. The whole of the land area of the group is held to belong, or to have belonged until alienated, to the natives. The Protocol regulates the acquisition of unregistered land from natives, and the registration of land claims. It provides for the creation of inalienable native reserves, and for the control of sales of land by natives to non-natives.

Taxation

The main forms of taxation are import duties (15% ad valorem, with certain exceptions) and duties of from 2% to 4% on exports of copra, cocoa, coffee, shell, etc. There is no income tax.

Condominium revenue and expenditure is shown in the following table:

| Year | Revenue (£Stg.) | Expenditure (£Stg.) |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1938 | 27,575          | 23,396              |
| 1948 | 101,818         | 75,108              |
| 1949 | 187,705         | 109,216             |
| 1950 | 210,305         | 157,461             |
| 1951 | 220,000         | 232,000             |
| 1952 | 320,000         | 366,000             |

Currency

English sterling and Australian and French currencies are legal tender in the New Hebrides.

Education

The French Government has established a free Primary school at Vila and the Roman Catholic Mission has schools at Vila and Santo. The British Government gives a small subsidy for a Primary school for British children and a Presbyterian Mission School for natives at Vila. Village schools are conducted by Mission bodies in the vicinity of their stations throughout the group.

Libraries

A public library is maintained at the French Residency.

Health

French Government hospitals and medical aid posts are established at Vila, Santo and Malekula and staffed by French National Medical Officers. Supported and subsidized by Her Majesty's Government, hospitals and medical aid posts have been established in some outlying islands. British and French National Medical Officers comprise a Condominium medical service providing quarantine control, medical inspection of plantation and other labour and medical assistance to the native population. This joint service is reinforced by New Hebrides Assistant Medical Practitioners trained at the central Medical School in Suva, some belonging to the Condominium and some to the British National Service. Simple medical work for natives is carried out by missionaries.

Communications

The only airfields are at Vila and Santo. Flying-boat landing facilities exist at both these places, and a weekly British flying-boat service operates through New Caledonia and Australia.

There are limited roads on Efate, Santo, Tanna and Malekula.

Shipping services are maintained with Australia, New Caledonia and Marseilles via Panama Canal and San Francisco. There is frequent inter-island communication (non-scheduled) by small vessels.

Telegraphic communication is by direct wireless contact with Suva, Noumea and Sydney, and there is an internal network of teleradio stations.

There is no Government or commercial broadcasting station.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is employed on plantations and in trading or subsistence agriculture. There are no trade unions.

The Main Crops are copra, cocoa, coffee, yams, taro, manioc and breadfruit. A large number of cattle are reared by the plantations (exact figures unavailable) and sheep are bred for wool on Erromanga. Minerals and manufactures are non-existent; subsistence fishing is done by the natives. Timber (Kauri pine) is exploited on Aneityum.

**THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN LINE ISLANDS**

These consist of Flint, Caroline, Vostock, Malden and Starbuck, and are administered direct by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, formerly under Article 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, and more recently in accordance with instructions issued by the Secretary of State in 1903, under Article 4 of the Order in Council.

Flint Island was discovered in 1801 but continued search has failed to elicit the name or nationality of the discoverer. Since 1872 it has been worked for guano and copra, with interruptions, by various British companies under licence issued by the High Commissioner. In 1951 it was leased to Mr. T. A. Bambridge of Tahiti.

Caroline Island was discovered in 1705 by Captain W. R. Broughton of H.M. Sloop *Providence*, and it has been worked by various British companies since 1846. It is now leased, with Flint, to Mr. T. A. Bambridge.

Vostock Island was discovered by Captain Bellingshausen, the Russian explorer, during his expedition to the South Pacific and Antarctic in 1820, and has been worked sporadically by British companies for guano and copra since 1873. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Malden Island was discovered by Lord Byron, Captain of H.M.S. *Blonde*, in 1825, after conveying the remains of the King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands back to Honolulu from England for burial. Its guano deposits were worked by an Australian company from approximately 1860 to 1927. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Starbuck Island was discovered in 1823 by Captain Starbuck, of the whaler *L'Aigle* owned by a London company. It was first worked for guano by a British company during the eighteen-sixties. Attempts to plant coconuts on the island failed and since 1920 it has been unoccupied and unworked.
