**Education**

The following schools for Arabs, Africans and Indians are maintained by Government:

| Number of Schools | Number of Pupils |
|-------------------|------------------|
|                   | Boys | Girls | Boys | Girls |
| Primary           | 34   | 6     | 5,544 | 1,098 |
| Rural Middle      | 1    | 1     | 129   | -     |
| Secondary (Senior)| 1    | 1     | 242   | 86    |
| Secondary (Junior)| 2    | 1     | 301   | 62    |

In addition, there is an enrolment of 994 boys and 1,429 girls at 12 grant-aided schools which cater mainly for Indians. There is a Muslim Academy for Islamic studies, and 25 boys a year are sent to the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education for a four-year course of technical training. Primary education in Government Schools is free for Arabs and Africans. Teachers for the Primary Schools are trained at the two teacher-training institutions, one for men and one for women. Post-secondary education for Arab and African students is provided at Makerere College, Uganda. Scholarships are provided for selected scholars to proceed to the United Kingdom and to India.

Schools are also run by various Christian Missions. European children usually attend schools on the mainland. They receive financial assistance from the Government, but have to pay a special education tax. Expenditure on education in 1951 was estimated at £163,848, compared with £27,220 in 1935.

**Health**

There is one combined Government Hospital for Europeans, Africans and Asiatics in Zanzibar, and two in Pemba; there are two maternity hospitals in Zanzibar. A new hospital with 200 beds, to replace the existing out-of-date building, is being constructed. Dispensary units are maintained in the rural districts, and there is one Isolation Hospital where cases of contagious and infectious diseases are treated. A tuberculosis sanatorium of about 40 beds has been established on high ground 13 miles from Zanzibar town. Anti-malarial measures are maintained in and around the town.

The total expenditure of the Health Department in 1952 was £163,996 compared with £35,577 in 1935.

**Communications**

Zanzibar airport is situated some four or five miles from the town. It has one all-weather runway. Operations are restricted to aircraft with a maximum all-up weight of 44,000 lb. This figure is ample for the types of aircraft in use at present, but the construction of the runway and the adjacent terrain is such that extensions could easily be made. A new airport building came into use in 1952. Air Traffic Control and other services are provided. The airport is open during daylight hours. The total number of aircraft movements during 1952 was 4,184. The number of passengers handled was 44,000 of which 10,000 were in transit.

Zanzibar has 210 miles of roads, of which 150 miles are bitumen surfaced; Pemba has 110 miles, of which 50 are bitumen surfaced. There are no railways.

Ocean-going vessels maintain regular and frequent communication with all parts of the world; 250 called at the port of Zanzibar during 1951, representing a total net registered tonnage of 1,217,933. Government steamers maintain regular weekly connexions with Pemba and Dar es Salaam. Coasting vessels, carrying both passengers and cargo, also maintain regular services between Zanzibar, Kenya and Tanganyika ports. During 1951 the number of coasting vessels entered was 450 with a net registered tonnage of 157,526; the number of native vessels entered was 3,290, with an aggregate tonnage of 113,035.

**Broadcasting**

The Government broadcasting service provides an hour's programme in Kiswahili six days a week, on a wavelength of 62·5 metres. The power of the transmitter is 0·25 kW. The station is the property of and operated by Cable and Wireless Limited under an agreement with Government. It is estimated that there are 1,000 receiving sets, most of them in Zanzibar Town. There is no licence fee.

**Principal Occupations**

A large proportion of the rural population is engaged in food production; paid labour is largely dependent on the Protectorate's two major industries, cloves and coconuts, and the processing and handling of their products. Agricultural labourers employed by Government number about 1,200. Fishing is also the occupation of a large number but they usually cultivate as well.

In urban areas, the principal occupations are transport, building, port and dock labour, domestic service, employment in sanitation and public works, clerical work, and business.

There are five employees' trade unions (membership 528) and one employers' union (membership 11).

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are cloves, coconuts, rice, cassava, sweet potatoes, citrus fruits, chillies, tobacco, maize and millet.

The number of cattle in Pemba is approximately 23,307 and in Zanzibar 9,606. The export of hides and skins is a useful item in the Protectorate's economy.

There are three forests, one in Zanzibar and two in Pemba which yield a small amount of Mfuu (Vitex cuneata) and Mtondo (Calophyllum inophyllum), while jackwood (Artocarpus integra) is a useful timber of the clove areas.

Fishing is an important activity and although most of the fish is consumed locally, small quantities of both fresh and dried fish are exported. Since the beginning of 1953 the Fisheries Vessel has been regularly at sea surveying the fishing-grounds and testing gear and equipment.

The only industries are the distillation of clove-oil, coconut-oil expression and the manufacture of soap. The manufacture of coir fibre and rope by hand is fairly extensive in the coastal areas, but most of the resulting product is at
present sold locally. A factory to process by-products of the coconut palm is expected to start operating shortly.

In 1938 14·66% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 39·53% from other Commonwealth countries and 45·81% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were United Kingdom 28·39, Commonwealth countries 34·27, foreign 37·34.

In 1938 4·74% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 31·83% to other Commonwealth countries and 63·43% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were United Kingdom 15·48, Commonwealth countries 60·99, foreign 23·53.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

The Clove Growers' Association, established in 1927 and incorporated by Decree in 1934, assists in stabilizing the price of cloves and distils and markets clove oil. The Association may also assist in the marketing of other products, for example, coconut oil. It also provides many valuable services to agriculturists.

There are 15 registered Co-operative Societies and more are in process of formation.

**Government Publications of Special Interest** issued during 1952–53 are:

- Census Digest.
- Trade Report.
- Guide to Zanzibar.
