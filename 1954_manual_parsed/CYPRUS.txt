CYPRUS

Area

The island of Cyprus is 3,572 square miles in area.

Population

The population in July, 1953, was 506,000, made up as follows—

Greek Orthodox... 406,000

Turkish Moslem... 90,000

Others... 10,000

Geographical Features

The three main zones are:

(a) the Kyrenia range, which rises to a height of over 3,000 feet, running along the northern coast and terminating in the Karpas peninsula;

(b) the massif in the south-west of the island, of which the highest point is Mount Olympus (6,406 feet); and

(c) the central plain, known as the "Mesaoria".

Climate

The mean temperature as recorded in Nicosia for the last 20 years is 66·6° F.; mean maximum 78·5° F.; mean minimum 54·7° F.; highest shade temperature during that time, 111° F.; lowest, 22° F.; average rainfall for the last 20 years, 20-09 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole island. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the seashore; on the hills inland it is bracing and healthy. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point on the plains and is mild on the coast, whilst the inland mountains are snow-covered for several weeks.

History

The history of Cyprus is long and eventful. In early historical times the island had been under the rule of Persia, Egypt, Rome and Byzantium,
During the last named period its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. In 1191 Cyprus was conquered by Richard I of England following the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. From Richard the island passed to the Knights Templars, and later, when they found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, although the Genoese Republic held Famagusta from 1373 until 1464. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island and retained possession of it until its transfer to British administration.

On 4th June, 1878, a convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements" consented "to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England".

On 14th August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of 5th November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognized the annexation.

On 1st May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally made a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

**Constitution**

Up to 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent of 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by Executive and Legislative Councils. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official members and 15 elected members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and 12 by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island, those clauses of the Letters Patent which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor. There is an Executive Council consisting, at present, of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, the Commissioner of Labour, and three non-official members.

**Land Policy**

Individual ownership of land is recognized and non-natives may acquire land. Except with the consent of the Governor, no alien may acquire, otherwise than by inheritance, ownership of any immovable property in the Colony. Compulsory acquisition of land may be made for purposes of public utility, with the consent of the Governor.

**Taxation**

Incomes which do not exceed £300 are exempted from income tax; and the tax ranges from 1s. for every £ in excess of £300 to 15s. for every £ in excess of £6,000. Relief is given at the rate of £50 for each unmarried child under the age of 16 or (if over 16) receiving full-time instruction at an educational establishment. Where any child between the ages of 11 and 25 is receiving full-time instruction outside the Colony, this allowance is increased by an amount not exceeding £200 in respect of expenditure incurred on the child's education. Relief is also given in respect of the wife's earned income up to a maximum of £50, and in respect of life assurance premiums and pension and provident fund contributions. In the case of bachelors and spinsters the tax payable is increased by 33½%, rising to 50% where the tax payable exceeds £90, up to a maximum of £500. The tax on salaries, wages and pensions is collected under the system of Pay As You Earn. Companies and similar bodies pay a flat rate of 7s. 6d. in the £ and deduct this tax from any dividends declared; credit is given to the shareholder for the tax thus paid in calculating his personal tax liability. Arrangements for relief from double taxation exist with the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, and relief is also given if tax is payable on the same income in any of Her Majesty's possessions where reciprocal relief is given. By an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom and the Greek Government there is reciprocal exemption of air transport profits between Cyprus and Greece.

Estate duty is levied on the estate of any deceased person which exceeds £2,000 in value. The rates of estate duty are not fixed on a percentage basis in the case of estates of £15,000 in value and under. Such estates are divided into categories and the rates are specific amounts chargeable on each category. The specific amounts so chargeable range from £40 on estates between £2,000 and £2,500 in value to £1,615 on estates between £14,000 and £15,000 in value. In the case of estates in excess of £15,000 in value a percentage is imposed. This percentage ranges between 21½% and 30% on that part of the estate which exceeds £15,000 in value. Relief is given in respect of quick succession where the estate consists of immovable property or a business.

Development Plans

An allocation of £1,790,000 has been made for Cyprus under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan which was begun in 1946. Further sums totalling approximately £230,000 will also be contributed to various development projects.

The plan, which in 1946 was estimated to cost £4,160,000, was revised in 1951 and is now estimated to cost £7,988,000, of which £4,532,000 is for schemes prepared when the plan was launched and £3,456,000 for new schemes. It is proposed to find the money from the following sources:

| Source                                      | Amount    |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Colonial Development and Welfare grants     | £2,005,500|
| Loan Monies raised in Cyprus                | £287,000  |
| Cyprus Revenue                              | £5,695,500|

It is proposed to spend the funds as follows:

| Service                        | Amount   |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| Basic Services                | £1,581,000|
| Social Services               | £2,374,000|
| Productive Services           | £4,033,000|
| **Total**                     | **£7,988,000**|

**Basic Services.**—Of the total amount allocated 23·55% will be spent on roads and 42·90% on village water supplies and village improvement.

**Social Services.**—About 60% of the total will be spent on medical and health services and 26·16% on education.

**Productive Services.**—34·81% of the total amount will be spent on agriculture, including soil conservation and the development of certain large estates in Paphos District which were compulsorily acquired for this purpose from their absentee owners; and 26% on irrigation.

Other Development

A law establishing the Electricity Authority of Cyprus became operative as from the 30th October, 1952, and the central power station at Dekelia went on commercial load on the 2nd of February 1953 supplying electricity to the towns of Nicosia and Limassol. The central supply has now been extended to the towns of Famagusta, Larnaca and Morphou. With the exception of certain small details the first stage of the electrification scheme has been completed and work planned under the second stage has been commenced. The second stage provides for the completion of a 66 kV. ring main between Famagusta and Nicosia via Lefkoniko with a spur line to meet development requirements of villages situated along the north coast of the Island. The programme also includes the installation of two additional boiler units, a 14,000 kW. turbo alternator set and extension of the 11,000 volt distribution system to villages adjacent to the 66/11 kV. transforming stations already established under the first stage.

In addition to the funds provided for the electrification scheme, Government has advanced and will continue advancing loans to public bodies and local government authorities to enable them to carry out their own development projects, e.g. workers' housing schemes, water supplies, street improvement, erection of public buildings, etc. From the beginning of the development decennium to the end of 1952 these loans amounted to £2,180,000, and it is estimated that by the end of the development decennium another £1,800,000 will be required for the same purpose, i.e. during the decennium Government's investment in what may be termed "indirect" development will total £3,000,000.

Education

There is at present no form of higher education in Cyprus other than the two Teachers' Training Colleges, one for men at Morphou and one for women at Nicosia. Secondary schools number 50 with an enrolment of 14,231, while elementary schools number 709 with an enrolment of 64,668. There are separate schools for Greeks, Turks, and Armenians, but most schools are co-educational. The school population is steadily increasing at present with a consequent rise in the number of teachers required and a need for more accommodation. Efforts are being made to develop technical education to a level more in keeping with the needs of the island.

In 1951-52 there were 47 Government scholars in the United Kingdom and 196 private students,
a total of 243. A number of teachers, sent on study leave with pay, are included among the private students.

Government expenditure on educational services in the school year 1951–52 amounted to £762,346 compared with £121,986 in 1935.

Libraries and Museums

In Nicosia, Kyrenia, Limassol and Paphos there are public libraries which are controlled by the Municipalities. The Antiquities Department maintain a Museum at Nicosia.

Health

Expenditure by Government on medical and allied services was £372,997 in 1952 compared with £52,436 in 1935. Ten Government hospitals (including two sanatoria, a mental hospital and a leper farm) provided 1,056 beds in 1952. In addition there were 573 beds in 47 private hospitals and 110 beds in 13 rural hospitals. Out-patients at Government institutions numbered 105,974; rural dispensaries dealt with 50,385.

Communications

Cyprus Airways Limited provide air services to the United Kingdom, Athens, Rome, Turkey, the Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and the Persian Gulf. Other airlines serving the Colony are B.O.A.C., Greek National Airlines, El Al, Middle East Airlines, Air Liban, Misrair, Turkish State Airlines and Air Jordan. There is one airfield at Nicosia and emergency landing grounds at Tymbou and Larnaca. There are no internal services.

The following table shows the roads, excluding Forest Department roads, which exist in the Colony:

| Roads                        | Miles |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Commissioners' roads (mostly gravel) | 1,884 |
| P.W.D. roads (gravel)        | 169   |
| P.W.D. roads (asphalt)       | 739   |
| **Total**                    | **2,792** |

The most important ports are Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol. Famagusta has a harbour where vessels of an overall length of 425 feet can easily be berthed alongside the quay. Vessels at Larnaca and Limassol anchor in the open roadstead about 4–5 cables off the main jetty, and goods are transported to and from the shore by means of lighters.

Regular passenger services are run between Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean. Cargo ships of many nationalities—the most regular being British vessels of the Mediterranean Conference Lines, some of which accept passengers—call at Cyprus ports, on itineraries between Continental and Mediterranean ports, Mediterranean and Red Sea ports and U.S.A., Mediterranean and Black Sea ports.

There is no railway or inland waterway.

Broadcasting

The Cyprus Broadcasting Service became fully operative on the 4th October, 1953. It is situated in Nicosia and operates on a medium-wave frequency with a power of 10 kW. The three languages used are English, Greek and Turkish. The number of wireless licence holders in the Colony in 1953 was 18,200, most of them in urban areas.

Principal Occupations

The principal occupation is agriculture in which some 137,000 persons are employed. Estimated numbers in other occupations in 1950 were:—manufacturing industries 44,000 (building and contracting 8,800, clothing 7,000, textiles 5,700); service industries 51,400 (distributive trades 10,500, catering and hotels, 7,000); mines and quarries 6,300; Government service 6,000.

At the end of 1952 there were three Employers' Associations with 71 members, and 114 Workmen's Unions with a membership of 16,094. In addition there were two Federations co-ordinating the activities of Workmen's Unions and four Unions of Civil Servants.

Main Crops and Products

Wheat, barley, potatoes (two crops a year), grapes, raisins, cotton, deciduous fruit (apples, pears, cherries, plums, apricots, peaches), olives, almonds, carobs (locust beans), citrus, pulse crops, sesame, cumin, aniseed, onions, tobacco, wines, spirits, cheese and wool.

The livestock population is: sheep 311,000; goats 163,000; swine 32,000; cattle 30,000; donkeys 44,000; mules 7,000; horses 4,000.

Timber production in 1952 was 998,000 cubic feet R.U.B. including 822,000 cubic feet of softwood (pine) and 176,000 of hardwood timber. Firewood and charcoal production amounted to 456,000 and 30,000 cubic feet respectively. All these products were consumed in Cyprus. In addition 2,138,000 cubic feet of timber and 413,000 of derivative products were imported in 1952.

Cyprus fisheries are not rich owing to the lack of nutrient salts, and the supply of fish is not equal to the demand. All the catch is sold locally and consumed fresh. 266 sailing boats, 54 sailing auxiliaries, using nets or lines, and 10 trawlers (9 Cypriot and 1 Greek), occupying altogether 900 persons, caught 320,575 okes* of fish, estimated at a value of £88,610, during the year 1952. Production of inshore fisheries is negligible.

The principal minerals are cupreous, iron pyrites and asbestos. Some 700,000 tons of pyrites, 100,000 tons of copper concentrates and 15,000 tons of asbestos are exported yearly. Chromite, gypsum and terra umbra are also produced and exported.

Cotton yarn spun locally satisfies a big proportion of the Colony's requirements; cotton goods and a variety of towels are manufactured locally by two main weaving plants and satisfy part of the local demand. There has recently been established in the island a modern ginnery and de-linting plant. Rayon goods are also manufactured on a limited scale. Other industries include the manufacture of cigarettes from imported and locally-grown yellow-leaf tobacco, wines and spirits, beer, cheese, macaroni, soap, soap oils, footwear, buttons, artificial teeth, carob gum, compound fodders, essential oils and perfumery, nails, lithographed crown corks, jute goods, plasters and plasterboards, pottery, bricks, tiles and mosaic. Plants for the refining of olive oil, the canning of jams, marmalades, fruit juices and vegetables also operate. An up-to-date factory for tyre retreading has been operating in the island since 1950. A great expansion has also been observed in the production of aerated drinks and of sugared almonds, Turkish delight and other confectionery.

Two important village industries are the manufacturing of "aladja"—a special kind of cotton cloth mainly worn by the rural population—and of high quality laces. Other village industries are twine, rope, basket and mat making.

In 1938 32·9% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 16% from other Commonwealth countries and 51·1% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were: 43·4%, 14% and 42·6%.

In 1938 24·6% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 4·6% to other Commonwealth countries and 70·8% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were: 21·4%, 3·6% and 75%.

The chief imports are wheat and wheaten flour, timber, machinery, iron and steel manufactures, vehicles, cotton, silk and woollen manufactures, empty sacks, and manures.

Tourist Traffic

Just over 27,000 visitors came to Cyprus during 1952 compared with 22,913 in 1951. Members of H.M. Forces and their families stationed in the Middle East were encouraged to spend their leave in Cyprus and more than 21,000 came. The island's economy benefited by this invisible export to the extent of over £1,000,000 (not included in the above figures).

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are at present no marketing boards in Cyprus, but two Bills providing for the establishment of such boards have been published for comments. All zivania (grape alcohol used in the wines and spirits industry) must be delivered to the Vine Products Control Scheme against an initial purchase price for which an advance is provided by Government. All profits from the sales of zivania by the Vine Products Controller are returned to the producers in the form of dividends. The Controller (Commissioner for Co-operative Development) is advised by a Board on which producers and manufacturers are represented. A special reserve fund for stabilization or other purposes has been created. Government is also the sole purchaser of wheat and barley through the agency of co-operative societies.

The only other organized form of marketing is that of the various co-operative marketing societies and unions (and one federation of carob unions), which deal with substantial quantities of carobs, wines and spirits, and potatoes and lesser quantities of oranges, cherries and other fresh and dried fruits. There are at present 725 co-operative societies, the main types being credit, marketing, processing, consumers' stores and farming societies. Membership exceeds 115,000, reserves are more than £700,000 and deposits approximately £1,700,000.
