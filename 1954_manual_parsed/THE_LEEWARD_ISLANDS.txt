THE LEEWARD ISLANDS

Area and Geographical Features.

The Colony has a total area of 423 square miles, and consists of a number of islands belonging partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. Anguilla, Sombrero and the British Virgin Islands lie apart, to the north and north-west. St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat and Redonda form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, and Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Antigua is the seat of government and residence of the Governor.

Population

The total population of the Colony at the 1946 census and the 1952 estimate are shown in the following table.

|                | Census 1946 | Estimate 1952 |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Antigua        | 41,757      | 48,214        |
| St. Kitts-Nevis| 46,243      | 51,044        |
| Montserrat     | 14,333      | 13,587        |
| Virgin Islands | 6,505       | 7,300         |
| **Total**      | **108,838** | **120,145**   |

Climate

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average annual rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to January.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493 and became British during the seventeenth century. They have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonized from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a humane slave amelioration Act.

Constitution

By the Leeward Islands Act, 1871, an Executive Council and a legislative body styled the General Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the five (now four) Presidencies which comprise the Colony. There is a majority of elected (now called representative) members on
the General Legislative Council, there being five representative members each from the Presidential Legislatures of Antigua and St. Kitts–Nevis–Anguilla, two representative members from the Presidential Legislature of Montserrat and one representative member from the Presidential Legislature of the Virgin Islands, a total of 13 members. The representative members on the General Legislative Council are chosen by the unofficial members of the Presidential Legislatures from amongst the elected members of those Legislatures. Presidential members are also associated with the administration of their Presidencies by their appointment to Committees, dealing with such subjects as social services, public works and trade and production, under the chairmanship of elected members. The official members of the General Legislative Council are the Colonial Secretary, the Administrators of Antigua and St. Kitts–Nevis–Anguilla, the Attorney-General, the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and two persons holding office of emolument under the Government of the Colony or of any Presidency appointed by the Governor, a total of eight members. There are also two nominated members, appointed by the Governor from amongst the nominated members of the Presidential Legislatures. The Governor is President of the Council and has a casting, but not an original, vote. There is also a Deputy President of the Council chosen from amongst its members.

The Federal Executive Council comprises four *ex officio* members and ten appointed members, of whom three are official and seven unofficial.

The General Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, air, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common prison, establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education, the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the General Legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the General Legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council, the life of which cannot exceed three years, meets at least once a year, at a place notified by Proclamation. There are usually two sessions a year lasting several days on each occasion.

The expenses of the federal establishment are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The General Legislative Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the Queen's pleasure, and the Queen has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the legislative body of such island and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act.

**Currency**

The British Caribbean Currency Board controls a unified decimal system of currency for the Eastern Group of the British Caribbean Territories, but only notes of denominations of $1 and upwards are at present in circulation. Trinidad and Tobago notes are being withdrawn. Silver and bronze coins of the United Kingdom are still in common use and are accepted at face value. United States currency circulates freely in the Virgin Islands, where all values and prices are determined by it.

ANTIGUA

Area

The area of Antigua is 108 square miles, the Dependency of Barbuda 62 square miles, the Dependency of Redonda (uninhabited) half a square mile. Barbuda lies 25 miles to the North, Redonda 25 miles to the south-west of the main island.

Geographical Features

The western part of the island of Antigua is composed entirely of volcanic rocks (highest point Boggy Peak, 1,330 feet). The eastern and northern parts are of limestone, below 500 feet above sea level, and a central plain stretches diagonally across the island. Barbuda is very flat with a large lagoon on the west side. There are no rivers.

Principal Town

St. John's, the capital, has a population of about 11,000.

History

The first settlers were a few English who arrived in 1632. In 1663 Charles II made a formal grant to Lord Willoughby, who at once proceeded to send out large numbers of colonists. For a short time the island was in French occupation, but in 1666 it was declared an English possession in terms of the Treaty of Breda and has remained British from that date.

Constitution

The Executive Council consists of the Administrator, the Crown Attorney and the Treasurer, as ex officio members, and five other members appointed by the Governor. The Governor, and in his absence, the Administrator, presides over the Executive Council.

The Legislative Council, as reconstituted in December 1951, is composed of the Administrator as President, two ex officio members, three nominated and eight elected members. A Deputy President is elected by the unofficial members of the Council from among their number.

Land Policy

Land may not be alienated or leased to aliens without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, alien occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. There is a small amount of Crown land which, when not used for public purposes, may be leased or sold.

Taxation

The main forms of taxation are income tax, trade tariffs and excise duties. The rates of individual income tax range from 6d. to 15s. 0d. per £ of chargeable income. Company's rate is 6s. 8d. per £ of chargeable income.

Provision has been made for double taxation relief with the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand and consideration is being given to extending the arrangements to other countries.

(a) Estimate.

Development Plans

Antigua was originally allocated £499,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. Up to the end of 1952 the sum of £485,770 was spent, leaving a balance of £13,230. Another grant of £200,000 was made in 1952 and it is now intended that the amount shall be spent in the following proportions, with the sum of £48,716 held in reserve:

- Public Works: £39,800
- Social Services: £21,845
- Productive Services: £40,966
- Housing: £122,314

Education

There are 27 Government elementary schools, one grant-aided and six recognized private schools, with a total enrolment of 10,257 pupils. The five Secondary schools—four grant-aided and one denominational—have a total enrolment of 1,107 pupils. A Teachers' Training College accommodates 33 female teachers from the four Presidencies of the Colony. The graduation standard from this college approximates to that of the Cambridge Senior School Certificate. There are ten students studying in the United Kingdom, 12 in the United States and four at the University College of the West Indies in Jamaica. Government expenditure on education approximates to £260,601 compared with £21,650 in 1935.

Health

The total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1953 was estimated at £548,746 compared with £86,318 in 1935. In 1951 the Hospital (94 beds) treated 2,183 cases. Apart from the dispensaries maintained at the residences of District Medical Officers, there are three health centres and 11 dispensaries.

Communications

Coolidge Airfield, which was constructed by the American Army Air Force as a military airfield in 1942, is now used by the local Government as a civil airfield. It is used mainly by Pan American Airways and British West Indian Airways with direct services to other West Indian Islands and to the United States of America. Travel to other parts of the world is made by connexions from Trinidad, Jamaica, and America.

There are 62 miles of main roads and 85 miles of secondary roads.

Principal Occupations

In 1950 the estimated number of persons employed was 14,400, 51% of them in agriculture and fishing.

The Main Products are sugar and cotton.

The area of land under forest and woodland is about 10 square miles.

Principal Town

Plymouth, the only town, has a population of about 2,500.

History

The island was colonized in 1632 when a number of Irishmen of Warner's company made their homes there. It was captured by the French in 1664, restored to England in 1668, capitulated to the French again in 1782, but was finally ceded to Britain in 1783.

It was estimated that in 1952, 24·5% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 4·5% from direct taxes.
Development Plans

Montserrat received an allocation of £124,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. This plan was revised at the end of 1951 and several useful projects are in process of execution or will be carried out in the next three years. Further grants from the Imperial Treasury now bring the total allocation to £188,000.

Other Development.

A private company, the Montserrat Company Limited, is working side by side with Government in the development of a livestock industry. The establishment of an electric light and power plant for Plymouth is also projected by Government.

Education

Primary education and secondary education are both in the main government controlled. There are 12 Government elementary schools, one aided denominational school, and one elementary private school. There is one Government Secondary school, and a preparatory private school for children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. At the end of 1952, of an estimated school population of 4,000, 3,172 children were enrolled in Primary schools, with an average attendance of 2,740 (86.0%). The enrolment of the Secondary school at the end of the same period was 160.

During the year 1952 there were four students from the Presidency pursuing professional courses abroad under the Leeward Islands Scholarship award, three of them in the United Kingdom, and one in Jamaica. Two young women completed courses in Great Britain under the London County Council Training Scheme for Nurses and one is doing an Arts Course under the Colonial £1,000,000 Scholarship Scheme. Two primary school teachers were in training in Trinidad.

Government expenditure on education in 1952 was $106,229 compared with $14,000 in 1935.

Health

Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1952 was $100,841, compared with $15,816 in 1935. There were 55 available beds at the Glendon Hospital. In-patients at the hospital totalled 989, out-patients (first attendances) 5,984. There were two health centres and four out-posts at which ante-natal and infant welfare clinics are held.

Communications

The island's road system consists of three main public roads, total mileage 33 miles; and about 30 miles of secondary unsurfaced roads. There is no railway or airfield.

The Canadian National Steamship Company maintains a fairly regular freight service with the Canadian and North American ports and as far south as British Guiana. The Alcoa and the Harrison Steamship Companies' steamers call when freight offers. The island is linked with other islands of the Colony, and with Dominica and Barbados, by two motor launches which maintain a regular service between all the islands.

Broadcasting

A local broadcasting service has recently been approved under a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Principal Occupations

In 1946, the total population gainfully employed was found to be 6,617, 59.68% of them in agriculture. There is one trade union in the island which claims a membership of 620.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, limes, sugar cane and sweet potatoes.

ST. CHRISTOPHER, NEVIS and ANGUILLA

Area and Geographical Features

The total area of the Presidency is 153 square miles (St. Kitts 68, Nevis 50 and Anguilla 35 square miles). St. Kitts has a range of lofty mountains traversing its central part (Mount Misery 3,711 feet). Nevis is nearly circular in form with a central mountain rising to 3,596 feet. Both islands are volcanic in origin. Anguilla is flat and composed of oligocene limestone and clay. Hot mineral springs with valuable medicinal properties are to be found near Charlestown, Nevis.

The Principal Towns are Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts, with a population of 13,500, and Charlestown, the capital of Nevis, population 3,600.

History

St. Kitts, with the other islands of the Presidency, was colonized by Sir Thomas Warner in 1623 (this date is now established, but has been variously given as 1624 and 1625). For more than a century it changed hands with the French as a result of constant warfare, but was finally restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, as was Nevis, and both have remained British possessions since that date. Anguilla has remained a British possession since its colonization.

Constitution

The Executive Council for the Presidency consists of the Administrator (when the Governor is present) two other ex officio members, and one other official member. There are five unofficial members, of whom one represents Nevis.

Under an Ordinance of 1952 the Legislative Council comprises the Administrator (President), two ex officio members, eight elected members and three nominated members. An elected majority in the Legislative Council is thus provided for.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot own land except under licence from the Governor.

Taxation

The main taxes in force are Customs duty and income tax. Income tax rates range from 6d. in the £ to 15s. in the £ upon the chargeable income of an individual. Companies pay a flat rate of 6s. 6d. in the £. Other taxes are house, land and trade tax.

BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS

Area

The total area of the Presidency is 67 square miles. Excluding numerous small rocks, the islands number 36, of which 11 are inhabited. The largest are Tortola (20 square miles), Virgin Gorda (13 square miles), Anegada (11 square miles) and Jost Van Dykes (7 square miles).

Geographical Features

Except for the flat coral island of Anegada, they rise abruptly like the tops of submerged mountains from a submarine plateau in 20-30 fathoms of water. The highest elevation is 1,780 feet—Sage Mountain, Tortola.

Principal Town

Road Town, Tortola (population 1,000), is the seat of the Presidential Administration.

History

These islands were settled by a party of English in 1666 and have been uninterruptedly British since then. The settlers were granted a charter in 1773 and the first House of Assembly was convened in that year.

Constitution

The constitution of the Presidency is governed by the Virgin Islands Constitution Act, 1950, enacted by the General Legislative Council of the Leeward Islands. By that Act the power vested in the Governor from 1902 to 1950 to legislate for the Presidency was abrogated and a Legislative Council was reconstituted. It consists of three official members, including the Commissioner as President, two nominated unofficial members and four elected members. The whole Presidency constitutes one electoral district. The only qualification required of voters is the ability to subscribe their names on the registration form. There are property qualifications for candidates for election. There is an Executive Council consisting of the Commissioner as the ex officio member when the Governor is present, two other officials and three unofficial members.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot hold land except under licence from the Governor. Such licences are granted only on condition that the alien undertakes to carry out some development and agrees to expend on the property a certain sum of money within a fixed period of years, usually three to four.

The total area of Crown lands is estimated at 18,000 acres. Most of it is situated in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. In Anegada, where the soil is poor, the occupants of Crown lands are allowed the use of those lands free of charge but rentals are collected from occupants of Crown lands elsewhere, where there is good soil fertility. Arrangements exist for the sale of Crown lands to occupants in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. Non-natives own approximately 2,626 acres of the total land area of the Presidency. The prevailing type of tenure for all holdings is fee simple.

Taxation

Taxes consist mainly of Customs duties and land, house, road and income taxes. Customs duties average 12% ad valorem at general rates and 8% ad valorem at preferential rates.

The income tax rate upon the chargeable income of every person other than a company, ranges from 6d. to 13s. 6d. in the £. Companies pay a flat rate of 5s. 6d. in every £.

Development Plans

The Presidency has been granted allocations totalling £106,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. Expenditure on schemes up to 1952 has been undertaken mainly on school buildings, agricultural and livestock development, water supplies and health projects. Since 1953 a road construction programme has been in progress; additional staff has been recruited for the Public Works Department to carry out the programme, and road-making machinery and plant have been purchased. A further revision of the Development Plan was approved in November, 1953.

Education

There is one Secondary and post-Primary, and one Primary school, maintained by Government; 11 denominational schools, which receive grants from Government funds; and two private schools. In 1952, there were 864 male and 944 female pupils enrolled at all schools. Attendance was approximately 75% of enrolment.

The cost of primary education, except the provision and maintenance of denominational school buildings, is met from Government funds and in 1952 the sum of $47,078 was so expended, compared with $3,446 in 1938.

Library

There is a small Library in Road Town with deposit services in the out islands. In 1952 the Library had a total of 9,263 books and 912 registered borrowers.

Health

The Tortola Cottage Hospital has 24 beds, and a total of 795 out-patients received treatment during 1952. There were 462 in-patients. The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1952 was $34,291 compared with $2,592 in 1938.

Communications

Launches maintain a mail and passenger service with St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, whence air, sea and cable communications exist to America and the Lesser Antilles. There is no broadcasting or radiocommunications service in the Presidency.

The Principal Occupation is stock-raising. Others are the production of charcoal, coconuts, fruit and vegetables, and fishing.

The Main Crops are coconuts, bananas, sweet potatoes and sugar.

The estimated livestock population in 1952 was: cattle 1,750, sheep 650, goats 2,300, swine 900. The fishing industry is unorganized.
