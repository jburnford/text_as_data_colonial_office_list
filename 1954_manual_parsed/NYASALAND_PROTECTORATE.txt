(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland)

Area
The area is 49,177 square miles of which 12,298 square miles is water (Lake Nyasa).

Population
The estimated population at the end of 1952 was 2,463,785:

| Europeans | Asiatics | Africans |

Geographical Features

Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa, and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000–3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland, and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chirwa and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate

The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History

The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters, and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to "The Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa"; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September, 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate" but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of "The Nyasaland Protectorate." The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

There was one internal disturbance, the Chilembwe Rising, in 1915, when an African pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges. Rapid counter-measures were taken and the rising came to an end.

Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 156). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council presided over by the Governor and comprising three ex officio members, two official members and two unofficial members, a total of seven; and there is a Legislative Council comprising 20 members, of whom three are ex officio members, seven are official members and ten are unofficial members. Five of the unofficial members of Legislative Council are selected from nominations by public bodies representing European interests; one is nominated by the Governor; three African members are selected from nominations made by the African Protectorate Council, and one Asian member from nominations made by an Asian public body. There is an African Protectorate Council which advises Government in regard to matters concerning Africans and in each Province there is also an African Provincial Council.

Land Policy is controlled by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Order in Council, 1950. African trust land, which represents approximately 87% of the total area of the Protectorate, may at the discretion of the Governor be leased for terms up to 99 years. The Secretary of State's sanction is required for
the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is held in freehold or by Government (including areas of state forest).

Taxation

Three forms of direct taxation are in force: non-native poll tax, income tax and surtax, and native tax. A non-native poll tax is payable by all non-native males over 18 years of age who are resident in the Protectorate. The tax is £4 per year, or £2 per half year. Income tax is payable by Companies at a flat rate of 7s. 6d. in the £. Income tax and surtax, where appropriate, are payable by individuals except Africans. Surtax is imposed on chargeable incomes in excess of £1,500. Rates of income tax begin at 1s. 3d. in the £ and reach the maximum rate of 5s. in the £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £1,100. Rates of surtax begin at 1s. 3d. in the £ and reach a maximum rate of 9s. 6d. in the £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £29,500. A native tax varying in amount from year to year is payable by all male Africans over 18 years of age. An automatic increase of a percentage of this tax is levied if the tax has not been paid by the 1st October in any year. The rate in 1953 was 17s. 6d. and the additional penalty 7s. 6d.

Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938    | 842,410     | 810,260         |
| 1948    | 2,048,732   | 2,104,893       |
| 1949    | 2,587,664   | 2,745,295       |
| 1950    | 3,545,763   | 3,598,195       |
| 1951    | 3,865,601   | 4,030,910       |
| 1952    | 3,949,208   | 3,904,596       |
| 1953 (estimate) | 3,876,861 | 4,099,646 |

It is estimated that in 1953, 26.7% of revenue will be derived from Customs and excise and 33.2% from direct taxes; and that main heads of total expenditure will be Public Works (28%), Education (6.4%) and Medical (6.1%).

The Public Debt at the end of December 1952 amounted to £4,970,000 composed of the following:

- East Africa Guaranteed Loan 3%: £1,570,000
- Development Loan 4½% 1971–78: £2,060,000
- H.M.G. Interest-free Loan: £1,340,000

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board in Salisbury on behalf of the three Central African Territories. It consists of notes of £5, £1, 10s. and 5s.; cupro-nickel coins of 2s. 6d., 2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d.; and cupro-nickel and bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. New issues of 5s. notes are, however, no longer being made. In addition, United Kingdom currency is legal tender, but is in the process of being withdrawn from circulation. Southern Rhodesia currency is interchangeable with sterling currency at par.

Development Plans

The Nyasaland Development Programme, as revised in 1950, provided for expenditure of £12½ million over the period 1946–56, and by the end of 1950 works to the value of approximately £3 million had been carried out. It was intended to finance this programme as follows:

- Colonial Development and Welfare Fund Allocation: £2,720,000
- Development Loan: £3,000,000
- Protectorate Revenue: £6,900,000

From 1951 onwards, large increases in the costs of material equipment and plant, coupled with a contraction in ordinary revenue, have combined to slow down the rate of planned development.

Further allocations of £500,000 in each of the years 1952 and 1953 from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund have raised the territorial allocation to £3,720,000, while in 1952 a £2 million Development Loan was raised.

With further assistance from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund the Shire Valley Project Survey is nearing completion and information should soon be available as to the possibilities of controlling the flow of the Shire River, generating hydro-electric power and irrigating large areas of the Lower River. Various research schemes are being financed from the Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, the most notable being a scheme for agricultural experimentation conducted near Lilongwe and a scheme for the geological mapping of the territory. Grants from the same source provide for the expansion of aeronautical telecommunications, for meteorological equipment, for the Domasi Community Development Scheme, for afforestation at Mudi Dam and for the establishment of a properly equipped forestry depot at Blantyre.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation is developing an undertaking on the Vipya Plateau in the Northern Province for the production of tung oil for export; export will be undertaken through the new port of Nkata Bay being constructed by Government on Lake Nyasa to facilitate the operation of a route by lake steamer and rail to Beira. Prospecting for minerals is proceeding and considerable interest was shown during the year in the monazite and pyrochlore deposits known for some time to exist in the Protectorate. The development of Nyasaland is, however, at present concentrated mainly on the expansion of the production of crops for export. Considerable attention is also being given to forestry development by establishing new plantations and re-afforesting cleared areas and by improving timber utilization and extraction facilities. Good progress is also being made towards the provision of minimum public utilities, and substantial programmes for the development of electrical services, urban water supplies and an up-to-date system of Postal and Telecommunications services are nearing completion. These latter works are being financed from the £2 million Development Loan raised in 1952.

A further general review of the Development Programme is now being undertaken, owing to the fact that all major loan works are nearing completion and to the setting up of the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland. The programme now being prepared, covering the period up to 1957, represents a drawing together of projects which have had to be deferred for reasons of financial stringency, continuation work on projects at present in course of implementation and projects for further development and to supply deficiencies in the existing programme.

Education

In 1952 there were 4,415 African, eight Asian, one Eurafrican and five European Primary Schools in the Protectorate, accommodating totals of 224,063 African, 746 Asian, 109 Eurafrican...
and 401 European pupils. There is a Government African Secondary School at Dedza, where technical and commercial wings, as well as academic, are being developed. Including enrolment at Blantyre and Zomba Secondary Schools, 218 Africans were pursuing a course of secondary education. European children generally go to Southern Rhodesia for post-primary education.

There are 12 assisted Teacher Training Centres, including the Government Jeanes Training Centre at Domasi. They catered for 204 African teacher trainees during the year. During 1952 there were 18 holders of Government University Scholarships. Nine of these were held by Africans, seven by Europeans and two by Asians. In addition, seven scholarships financed by a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, were held during 1952, four by Africans and three by Europeans. Two full scholarships were also awarded to enable Africans to complete courses of higher studies in India, one the gift of the Government of India and the other of an Indian resident.

Expenditure on education for the year 1952 was some £307,600, including estimated expenditure by local authorities and voluntary agencies. In 1934 expenditure was some £67,000.

Libraries

Public libraries exist at Blantyre for both Africans and Europeans, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at the three secondary schools, the Secretariat and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of subjects and makes these available to study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health

The principal endemic diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread while epidemics of smallpox occasionally occur. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, reappeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952.

There are 19 Government African hospitals in the Protectorate with accommodation for 1,200 patients. Each hospital has a number of satellite rural dispensaries of which there are 93 in the Protectorate. There are three Government European hospitals with a total of 38 beds. Accommodation for Asians is provided at various of the Government hospitals. Mission hospitals provide 743 beds inclusive of maternity.

Estimated Government expenditure on health in 1952 was £261,540. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £40,808.

Communications

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and ten out-station airfields to which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Director of Civil Aviation, and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre and Lilongwe. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation, and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways operate a twice-weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam. Connexions with the Comet service to the United Kingdom can be made at Entebbe, in Uganda, or at Livingstone.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 289 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Province. At Chipoka south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. In 1952, 278,782 tons of freight and 316,547 passengers were carried.

The total road mileage is 4,765, of which less than 100 miles have a bituminous carpet.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing eight vessels. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

Monkey Bay–Chipoka–Kota Kota–Likoma Island–Chintech–Nkata Bay–Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika)–Ruarwe–Florence Bay–Deep Bay–Ngara–Kapororo (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

Broadcasting.

A small pilot broadcasting service was started in September 1953, but technical and other difficulties led to the station being closed down in December. Recording in the Zomba studio continues and arrangements have been made for the transmission of a daily half-hour programme from Lusaka. It is hoped to install a new permanent transmitter at Zomba in 1954. There are about 3,000 receiving sets in the Protectorate with an estimated average of eight listeners per receiver.

The Principal Occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, tung farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and cotton cultivation, retail trading.

There are four Trade Unions in the Protectorate with a total membership of 910.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize, millet, cassava, groundnuts, tea, tobacco, rice, cotton, tung-oil, soya beans.

Timber production in 1952 was: softwoods 234,861 cubic feet, hardwoods 225,382 cubic feet, poles 199,206 cubic feet, firewood 2,045,405 cubic feet.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa but very little organized trade: fishery research is being undertaken.

The only mineral exported during the year was corundum.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of plywood, soap, cigarettes, and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

* Including Government imports but not bullion and specie.

In 1938, 45·7% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 5·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 48·4% from foreign countries. In 1952, 49·3% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 22·9% from other Commonwealth countries, and 27·8% from foreign countries.

In 1938, 90·6% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 3·4% to other Commonwealth countries, and 6% to foreign countries. In 1952, 62·6% went to the United Kingdom, 20·9% to other Commonwealth countries and 16·5% to foreign countries.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The marketing of the two principal African trust land crops, tobacco and cotton, is handled by two statutory boards, whose aim is to ensure a steady remunerative price to the producer, to secure improvement of the quality of the product and to build up reserves. The boards help to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of an annual contribution from profits to the Native Development and Welfare Fund. The marketing and distribution of maize, beans and groundnuts is the concern of the Produce Marketing Board which aims at an equitable distribution to industry and others of supplies of produce surplus to the subsistence requirements of the producer. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom or other extraterritorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1952 there were 71 co-operative societies, with 3,206 members and a total working capital of £13,484 of which some £4,700 consists of loans provided by the Commissioner for Co-operative Development from the Native Development and Welfare Fund of the Protectorate.
