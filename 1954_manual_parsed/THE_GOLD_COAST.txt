THE GOLD COAST

Area

The total area is 91,843 square miles (Colony 23,937, Ashanti 24,379, Northern Territories Protectorate 30,486, Trust Territory of Togoland 13,041 square miles).

Population

At the 1948 census the population was 4,118,450:

| African | Non-African |
|---------|------------|
| Gold Coast | 4,111,680 | 6,770 |
| Colony | 2,217,416 | 5,394 |
| Ashanti | 817,782 | 1,162 |
| Northern Territories | 1,076,482 | 214 |

The part of Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship (included in the above) ... 382,717 51

The total population of the Gold Coast in mid-1953 was estimated at 4,478,000.

Geographical Features

The Gold Coast is divided into three main zones:

(i) A narrow belt of plains and scrubland, 5–50 miles wide and following the coastline. It includes the Accra Plains and is intersected by rivers and streams. Only three rivers have permanently open mouths, guarded by shallow river bars.

(ii) A belt of tropical rain-forest extends northwards from the coast, near the western frontier, for some 170 miles. The area is broken by ranges of heavily wooded hills, some of which rise from 600–2,000 feet, and is intersected by numerous rivers and streams navigable only by canoes. This area produces most of the timber, cocoa and minerals which play an important part in the economy of the Gold Coast.

(iii) North of the forest belt the country undulates gently between 300–1,300 feet, and is mostly covered by orchard bush with park-like areas and stretches of treeless plains. A range of hills runs north and south along the eastern boundary reaching a maximum height of 2,900 feet.

Climate

Except in the north, there are two rainy seasons in the year, separated by a short comparatively dry spell in July and August and a longer dry season from December to February. During the rainy seasons the well-known West African squalls normally occur. In the Northern Territories the two rainy seasons tend to merge into one to the exclusion of the short dry spell. The longer dry season is correspondingly extended.

Dry north-easterly winds (the harmattan) reach the Gold Coast in January and February. They frequently bring particles of fine dust from the deserts in the north and cause a haze, which may become so thick as to impede navigation on the sea and in the air.

There are four fairly distinct climatic regions, namely the eastern coastal belt—warm and fairly dry; the south-west corner—warm and very humid; the forest belt—warm and humid; and the north—hot and dry:—
In December and January the hot days in the Northern Territories are associated with very cool nights. The averages of minimum and maximum temperatures for these months show a diurnal range of 29°. During these months daytime humidity may fall to less than 20%.

**History**

The Gold Coast first became known through Portuguese navigators, who visited the district in 1471 in their search for gold, ivory and spices. They built a chain of forts and castles along the Coast and these served as their trading posts. The slave trade later attracted the attention of traders of other European nations, notably the English and the Dutch; and in 1642 the Portuguese were compelled to abandon their possessions to the newcomers. By 1750, all the other European nations had relinquished their settlements on the Coast with the exception of the English, the Dutch and the Danes, who had their headquarters at Cape Coast, Elmina and Christiansborg respectively.

In 1821 the Imperial Government assumed full control of the British Settlements on the Coast; and by a convention made in 1871 the Dutch, who then remained the only other European nation on the Gold Coast, ceded their settlements to the British.

The Colony of the Gold Coast was created by Charter in July 1874, and in August of the same year an Order in Council empowered the Legislative Council to legislate for the new Colony by ordinance. Even then the Colony did not include all the areas under British protection as the boundaries remained undefined. To regularize the position, therefore, these protected areas were annexed as a British possession in 1901 and the boundaries of the Colony were fully defined by Order in Council in 1906.

In the interim the eighteenth century saw the rise of the formidable confederacy of the Ashantis, who soon began to demand a larger and a more direct share of the trade with the Europeans. As could be expected, the Coastal peoples resisted their demands, and this led to a continuous struggle. Eventually, in the nineteenth century, the Ashantis came into open conflict with the English, who tried to protect the Coastal peoples. In 1874, after a series of Ashanti wars, Sir Garnet Wolseley led a successful campaign against Kumasi, the stronghold of the Ashantis. After a final struggle in 1900, Ashanti was annexed to the British Crown in 1901, Prempeh, the King, was exiled and was only allowed to return in 1924. The Ashanti Confederacy was restored in 1935 and Prempeh's successor was proclaimed Asantehene, the Ashanti title for the head of the Ashanti nation.

The Northern Territories came under British rule after the conclusion of treaties with the Chiefs in 1897.

In 1922 a portion of the adjoining German territory of Togoland was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as a part of the Gold Coast. This strip of land became a Trusteeship Territory after the formation of the United Nations Organization.

**Constitution**

The present constitution came into effect on the 1st January, 1951. It provides for a Cabinet, presided over by the Governor, and consisting of a Prime Minister, appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of the Legislative Assembly, three *ex officio* Ministers (the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary) and not less than eight Representative Ministers who are drawn from the Assembly. In the absence of the Governor, the Prime Minister presides at Cabinet meetings. There is provision for Ministerial Secretaries to be appointed from the Assembly and for a public officer to be appointed by the Governor as Permanent Secretary in each Ministry.

The Legislative Assembly consists of a Speaker, three *ex officio* Members, three Special Members representing commercial interests, three Special Members representing mining interests and seventy-five elected Members. Of these, thirty-three are chosen by indirect election to represent rural constituencies; nine are territorial Members elected by the Joint Provincial Council; six are territorial Members elected by the Asanteman Council; nineteen are territorial Members chosen by an electoral college for the Northern Territories; three are territorial Members chosen by the Trans-Volta/Togoland electoral college and five Members are directly elected by the municipalities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and Cape Coast.

In June, 1953, a White Paper was published containing the Gold Coast Government's proposals for constitutional reform. The main proposals were that the posts of the three *ex officio* Ministers should be abolished, the portfolios of Finance and Justice being given to Representative Ministers, and Defence, External Affairs and
Togoland becoming the responsibility of the Governor, assisted by a Deputy; and that the Legislative Assembly should be enlarged to consist of 104 Members, all of whom would be chosen by direct election on a basis of universal suffrage. The Governor's reserved powers would be retained and he would remain responsible for the Public Service.

The proposals were submitted to the Secretary of State, who said in Parliament on 21st October, 1953, that, taken as a whole, they were in broad principle acceptable to H.M.G., although there were a few points which might not prove acceptable or required clarification. Since then there have been detailed exchanges with the Gold Coast.

**Land Policy**

In the Colony and Ashanti the land is owned by Stools*, families or individuals, except such as has been acquired by the Crown, mainly for public purposes. Grants by natives, other than customary grants, are subject to the provisions of the Concessions Ordinance, 1939, and subsidiary legislation made thereunder. In the Northern Territories the control of all land is vested in the Governor and all minerals are vested in the Crown. The vesting of rights in land in non-natives is therefore controlled by the Government. In Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, the law applicable to the Colony applies to the Southern Section, and the law applicable to the Northern Territories, to the Northern Section. In addition it is unlawful for any native without the consent of the Governor to alienate any interest in land to a non-native. In Kumasi, Accra, Sekondi-Takoradi and Cape Coast all development is planned and controlled by statute. In other towns and villages development is planned and controlled by local authorities with the advice of the Ministry.

**Taxation**

Income tax is levied on individuals, and on bodies of persons other than companies, on a graduated scale rising from 3d. in every £ of the first £200 of chargeable income to 11s. 6d. for every £ exceeding £10,000. The rate of tax upon companies is 9s. in the £, with relief for small companies incorporated locally during their first six years and for companies formally admitted as pioneer enterprises. Minerals duty is imposed upon the value of minerals won at rates varying with the profitability of the undertaking. Persons other than companies are exempt from this tax if they are engaged in winning diamonds or small quantities of gold only.

**Public Finance**

§ Approved Estimates.

* Symbol of a Chief's authority.

The main divisions of revenue collected during the year 1952–53 were:

- Customs and Excise: £26,477,680
- Direct Taxation: £8,521,875
- Fees of Court, etc.: £1,463,610

- Other charges annually recurrent: £17,497,788
- Transfers to Development Funds: £13,708,656
- Extraordinary: £2,245,812

During the year 1951–52 69·7% of the revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 17·2% from direct taxes.

The Public Debt at the end of March 1953 amounted to £14,073,657 (approximately £3 3s. per head of population) comprising:

- Gold Coast 4½% Stock, 1956: £4,628,000
- Gold Coast 4¼% Stock, 1960–70: £1,170,000
- Gold Coast 3¾% Stock, 1954–59: £602,000
- Gold Coast 3¾% Stock, 1963: £2,010,000
- Loans from Cocoa Marketing Board: £5,663,657

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is a West African currency issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four British West African Territories. It consists of notes of 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d., ½d. and penny. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par. The estimated total currency outstanding at 31st July, 1953, amounted to £31,650,000.

**Development Plans**

The Gold Coast Development Plan, which was approved by the Legislative Assembly in 1951, for commencement with effect from the 1st April, 1951, provides for a total expenditure of approximately £77½ million. This total is to be spent in the following proportions:

- Economic and Productive Services: 20%
- Communications: 30%
- Social Services: 33%
- Common Services: 17%

No definite period is laid down for completion of the Plan as a whole, but it is anticipated that £59 million will be spent in the five years 1951–56. In the first two years of the Plan just over £20 million was spent. The approximate estimated expenditure under some of the more important heads during the first five-year period will be as follows:

- Agriculture: £3,300,000
- Electricity: £1,500,000
- Urban Water Supplies: £3,000,000
- Rural Water Supplies: £1,600,000
- Roads: £11,700,000
- Railways: £8,000,000
- Posts and Telecommunications: £1,500,000
- Education: £9,400,000
- Medical: £4,500,000
- Housing: £4,600,000
- Offices, Staff Quarters, etc.: £4,500,000

Grants of approximately £4,000,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and £500,000 from the Mutual Security Agency are...
being received. The Plan is kept under constant review by the Standing Development Committee of the Cabinet.

**Other Development**

Outside the scope of the Development Plan the two main items are the Volta River Project and the construction of a new modern port at Tema, 17 miles to the east of Accra. The former is a multi-purpose development scheme involving the harnessing of the River Volta to produce cheap hydro-electric power; the exploitation of the extensive bauxite deposits for the production of aluminium; the construction of the necessary road and rail communications to carry the bauxite to the smelter and the aluminium to the port; and possibly the provision of a country-wide electrical grid and the irrigation of the Accra Plains. The aluminium production would be in the hands of private enterprise while the power project would be publicly owned. The total expenditure, including the cost of public works, is estimated at £124 million for a scheme designed to produce 210,000 tons of aluminium ingot per annum. Active investigations into the feasibility of the scheme have been proceeding since 1949 and at the end of 1952 the Gold Coast Government in consultation with Her Majesty's Government decided to set up a Preparatory Commission which would complete the investigations necessary to bring the scheme to its final form. The Preparatory Commission was set up in 1953 and hopes to complete its work by 1955.

The Gold Coast is short of adequate port facilities, particularly on the eastern seaboard. The construction of a new harbour near Accra, with road and rail links to the existing network, was begun in 1952. The first phase, involving the provision of four deep water berths, is estimated to cost over £10 million and will, in addition to normal traffic, meet the needs of the aluminium industry when required. The access railway from Accra is expected to be complete early in 1954.

**Education**

In December 1952 there were in the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories, excluding Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship, 3,432 Primary and Middle schools with an enrolment of 371,320 (269,074 boys and 102,246 girls) and 53 Secondary schools with an enrolment of 6,448 (3,595 boys and 853 girls). Post-primary technical institutions had an enrolment of 790 (729 boys and 61 girls) and 2,137 students were in teacher-training colleges (1,516 men and 621 women).

The University College of the Gold Coast is entirely residential. It provides training to degree standard in the Faculties of Arts, Science, Economics and School of Agriculture. For this purpose it maintains Departments each under a Professor or Senior Lecturer in English, Classics, Geography, History, Mathematics, Economics, Theology, Philosophy, Sociology, Phonetics, French Studies, Archaeology, Botany, Chemistry, Physics, Zoology and Geology, and possesses the following Associated Institutes and Establishments:—Biological Institute, Institute of Education, School of Education, College Bookshop, Library and Bindery and National Museum.

Under a separate grant from Government, it administers a Department of Extramural Studies. The number of undergraduates in residence is 450. These have been accommodated, so far, in temporary halls and converted dormitories on the Achimota site.

There is a College of Technology, Arts and Science in Kumasi with an enrolment of 438 students in residence. This College offers courses in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and courses in Accountancy, Surveying, Building, Secretarial Practice, Pharmacy and Agriculture. It has a Department of Teachers who are specially trained in Arts and Crafts, House Craft, Music and Physical Education. In addition the College gives two-year courses leading to the Higher School Certificate Examination and London University Intermediate Art and Science Examinations.

Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship had at the same date 387 primary and middle schools with an enrolment of 38,588 (25,927 boys and 12,661 girls); there were five secondary schools with an enrolment of 561 (560 boys and 1 girl); three teacher-training colleges and between them 226 students (183 men and 43 women).

Students of the Gold Coast and Togoland studying in the United Kingdom numbered 774. Of these 256 were Scholars (228 being Government Scholars), 411 private students and 107 artisan scholars. In addition there were 127 students in the United States of America.

At the end of December, 1952, 18,000 learners had passed the literacy test and been awarded a Gold Coast Literacy Certificate. Literacy classes had been established in 1,207 towns and villages, with a total of 2,868 separate classes. Sales of Primers for the year were 81,679.

The comparative figures in respect of expenditure on education are as follows:

| Year | Amount |
|------|--------|
| 1927 | £146,728 |
| 1937 | £290,553 |
| *1952-53 | £3,342,040 |

* Including Ordinary, Extraordinary, and Development Expenditure.

**Libraries and Museums**

The Gold Coast Government has entrusted to the University College of the Gold Coast the formation and development of a National Museum, the scope of which is provisionally defined as the achievements of man in Africa. The Professor of Archaeology (whose post was established in 1951) is Director of the National Museum, and the Department of Archaeology functions as its Research Branch, undertaking surveys and excavation in the Gold Coast as well as collecting antiquities and ethnological specimens. The collections are now housed by the Department at Legon, in a building which is to have a small museum for teaching. A public Gallery is to be constructed in Accra.

The Gold Coast Library Board, a statutory body established in 1950, provides public library services over the whole country. There is a Central Library in Accra, and branch libraries in Kumasi, Cape Coast, Sekondi, Tamale and Ho. Lending and reference libraries, postal services, book box services, mobile libraries and children's libraries are provided. The book stock numbers 83,000 volumes.

**Health**

The principal diseases treated in 1952 included malaria, pneumonia, helminthic diseases, rheumatic conditions, affections of the respiratory system, nutritional diseases, skin diseases, diseases of the eye and annexa, and diseases of the digestive system. There are four central hospitals
(Government) with specialist facilities, in addition to 28 Government, 14 Mines, 3 Mission and 9 private hospitals with a total of 2,490 beds and 349 cots. The number of beds is distributed as follows:—Government 1,730, Mines 466, Mission 133, Private 161. These hospitals are supplemented by 23 Government and 126 non-Government dressing stations in rural areas. One Government health centre was completed and opened during the year and two were nearing completion. In 1952 there were 62,586 in-patients and 976,201 out-patients in the Government hospitals alone.

There are three Schools of Hygiene (Accra, Tamale and Kintampo) for the training of Sanitary Inspectors and Superintendents. The Medical Field Units make surveys and initiate mass treatment of trypanosomiasis and yaws, experiment in mass treatment of onchocerciasis with antrypol and undertake enquiries into the incidence of other endemic diseases, such as guinea-worm, bilharzia, leprosy, malaria, etc.

Estimated expenditure on medical and health services for 1953–54 is £2,657,390, including £760,000 estimated for new (development) projects. This figure may be compared with £298,810 in 1935–36, and £281,935 in 1925–26.

Communications

The International Airport at Accra is linked with the other international airports of Kano and Lagos in Nigeria, Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo, Robertsfield in Monrovia and Abidjan and Lome in French West Africa by direct air routes.

This airport also serves the following international trunk routes:—

- British Overseas Airways Corporation—United Kingdom.
- Pan American World Airways—New York/Johannesberg.
- Transportes Aéros Portugueses—Lisbon/Portuguese West Africa.
- Air France and Union Aero Maritime Transport—French West Africa.

In addition to the international airport at Accra, internal aerodromes are provided at Takoradi, Kumasi and Tamale. These aerodromes are linked with the capital by internal services operated by the West Africa Airways Corporation.

The total railway mileage open to traffic on 31st March, 1953, was 535 and the track mileage was 643. The main line runs from Takoradi to Kumasi, thence to Accra, a distance of 357 miles; with branches: Takoradi Junction to Sekondi (3 miles), Tarkwa to Prestea (18 miles), Aboso to Cinnamon Bippo (4 miles), Huni Valley to Kade (99 miles Central Province line) and Dunkwa to Awaso (46 miles). The main line and branches are 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. 6,401,617 passengers were carried during the financial year 1952–53 and 1,859,703 tons of freight.

There are 3,529 miles of roads maintained by the Public Works Department; bituminous surface 1,038 miles. In addition a considerable mileage is maintained by Regional Organizations and Native Authorities.

The chief port is Takoradi; there are smaller “surf” ports at Accra, Winneba, Cape Coast and Keta. During 1952, 6,502,000 net registered tons of shipping entered and cleared at all ports, of which 5,286,000 tons were handled at Takoradi.

Broadcasting

The Gold Coast broadcasting service run by the Government operates from Accra on two transmitters rated respectively at 1·3 kW. and 5 kW. Twenty-seven re-diffusion stations carry the Accra and B.B.C. services to 15,382 subscribers throughout the country. There are in addition 4,722 licence holders.

Principal Occupations

A large proportion of the population is engaged in agriculture, primarily cocoa and subsistence farming. Returns rendered by employers which, however, cover only a part of the working population, showed the numbers in the main occupations on 31st December, 1952, to be: agriculture, forestry and fishing, 25,005; mining and quarrying, 41,037; manufacturing, 11,776; construction, 41,814 (at 31st December, 1951); electricity, gas, water and sanitary services, 3,127; commerce, 23,749; transport, storage, communications, 18,511; Services, 47,439. Of the total of these figures, employment in the Central Government accounted for 74,210.

There were 75 registered trade unions as at 31st December, 1952, of which 66 had submitted returns as at 31st March, 1953, showing a total of 41,231 paid-up members.

Main Crops and Products

Almost all agricultural production in the Gold Coast is carried out by peasant farmers, sometimes organized as communal groups. Modifications in the traditional pattern of agriculture are gradually taking place, partly as a result of experiments and extension work by the Department of Agriculture and partly as a result of economic changes in the country.

In recent years rather more than one-third of the world’s supplies of cocoa have come from the Gold Coast which is the largest single producer. Within the Gold Coast cocoa is the basis of the national economy; since World War II, exports of cocoa beans have averaged a little under 70% of the total value of domestic exports and about 92% of agricultural exports. Apart from a relatively small amount which is processed in a local factory, all cocoa produced is exported as prepared beans. Production is entirely in the hands of individual agriculturalists whose plantations are mostly very small.

The main food crops are millet, maize, guineacorn, plantain, yams, cassava, cocoyam, groundnuts, cowpeas and rice.

Other relatively important agricultural products are palm oil and palm kernels, kola-nuts, coconut oil, copra and coconuts, and shea butter. Minor crops include rubber, coffee, bananas, cotton and fibres.

Palm oil and palm kernels were the most important agricultural exports of the Gold Coast until the rapid expansion of the cocoa industry supplanted them. There is a very considerable internal trade in pericarp and kernel oils; the oils are extracted by hand, and consumed over a wide area. They are also used for soap-making on a cottage-industry scale.

Livestock number:—cattle 395,160; sheep 464,320; goats 427,629; pigs 57,984; horses 5,836; poultry 2,525,862; donkeys 16,814.

During 1952–53 local production of livestock for slaughter numbered:—cattle 26,085; sheep 60,051; goats 55,582; pigs 5,717. This stock
did not meet the needs of the country as regards meat and 59,143 head of cattle, 134,988 sheep, 101,140 goats and 306 pigs were imported.

Timber exports in 1952 totalled 5,912,660 cubic feet of logs, 2,973,700 cubic feet of lumber and 87,600 cubic feet of plywood and veneers.

Sea fisheries are a major source of food, contributing some 20,000 tons in a normal year. The fishermen, of whom there are about 50,000, work from dugout canoes. Species comprised in the catch include sardinellas, Caranx, tunny, shark, snapper, breams, drums, and threadfins. The catch is preserved for inland distribution chiefly by smoking and by salting and sun-drying. Fishing is also pursued in the rivers, particularly in the Volta and its tributaries. The catch is much smaller than that from the sea, but it is of value to inland districts.

Development of the industry is being sought through the introduction of motor fishing vessels, and of canning and dehydration for preserving fish.

Gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite are mined.

### Trade

| Year | Total Imports | Re-exports | Domestic Exports |
|------|---------------|------------|------------------|
|      | £            | £          | £                |
| 1938 | 7,866,235    | 195,998    | 11,162,918       |
| 1948 | 31,377,945   | 798,084    | 55,303,715       |
| 1949 | 45,415,973   | 853,098    | 49,073,980       |
| 1950 | 48,106,193   | 1,170,226  | 76,236,718       |
| 1951 | 63,713,598   | 1,989,735  | 90,052,906       |
| 1952 | 66,484,668   | 2,089,710  | 84,353,758       |

In 1938, 54·5% of imports came from the United Kingdom, 5·8% from other Commonwealth countries and 39·7% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 56·8%, 5·79% and 37·5%.

In 1938, 65·5% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 2·6% to other Commonwealth countries and 31·9% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1952 were 40·4%, 4% and 55·6%.

The chief imports are cotton piece-goods, iron and steel manufactures, machinery, petroleum oils, motor vehicles, artificial silk manufactures, live animals for food, cement, alcoholic liquors, wheat flour, fish, meat, sugar, medicines and drugs.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are two Marketing Boards, one dealing with cocoa and the other to handle scheduled agricultural produce. The produce at present on the schedule consists of oil palm produce, copra and coconut oil, shea nuts and shea butter, coffee and groundnuts. These Boards ensure orderly marketing, aim to improve the quality of the products, guarantee prices to the producers by announcing minimum buying prices before each season, pay a reasonable remuneration to buying agents, spend money on research, and finance schemes for the benefit of the people in the producing areas. World prices for these products are high at present; but both Boards have stabilization funds which would supplement the price to the producer should world prices decline.

At the 31st March, 1952, there were 377 registered primary co-operative societies with 33,000 members. The total distributable surplus for the year was £108,000. Savings and deposits amounted to £46,000, and capital and reserves to £380,000.

**Geographical Features**

The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the North, together with some 75 adjacent islands ranging from Lantau with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria, the capital, on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.

The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside covered with dense scrub in some parts, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented.

A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain Taimoshan, 3,141 feet; Lantau Peak is 3,067 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,809 feet high.

**Climate**

The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° F. in February to 82° F. in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84.76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.

**Principal Towns**

The great bulk of the population lives in Victoria and Kowloon, which are each estimated to contain close to one million people. There are several flourishing market towns in the mainland part of the New Territories, which is predominantly agricultural, but the population has increased in some areas as a result of industrial development in post-war years. The most thickly populated of the outlying islands is Cheung Chau, with about 22,000 inhabitants. The fishing communities on the coast live to a great extent permanently afloat.

**History**

Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters' Island in the harbour, Aplichau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a
