NORTH BORNEO

Area

The territory, which includes the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo, is divided into three Residencies: East Coast, 16,545 square miles; Labuan and Interior, 7,648 square miles and West Coast, 5,195 square miles (total 29,388 square miles).

Population

The 1952 estimate was 348,404:

- Indigenous: 246,977
- Chinese: 79,039
- European (including Eurasian): 1,492
- Others: 20,896

Geographical Features

Central mountain ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet in height, rise somewhat sharply from low hills nearer the coast and culminate in Mount Kinabalu (13,455 feet) the highest mountain in the East Indies. The coastline is formed mainly of alluvial flats, with many creeks and swamps. Hills and valleys in most cases are covered with dense forest and there are many rivers. The most extensive plain is that on the east coast, irrigated by the river Kinabatangan and its tributaries, and believed to contain some 4,000 square miles of rich and fertile soil. In the interior are found the Keningau and Tambunan plains which are traversed by the Pegalan River. The Keningau plain consists of wide stretches of grassland, while Tambunan maintains a large padi-planting population.

Labuan, 35 square miles in area, is an island lying six miles off the mainland. It has an excellent, well-sheltered harbour.

Climate

This is relatively cool for a place situated so near the equator.

| Mean Maximum Temperature | Mean Minimum Temperature | Mean Rainfall |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Jesselton                | Sandakan                 | Tambunan (in the high land of the interior) |
| 88°                      | 88°                      | 86°          |
| 72°                      | 75°                      | 66°          |
| 137°-02                  | 115°-06                  | 76-91        |

Humidity is relatively high in most places although there are a few comparatively dry belts. The wet season extends from October to February but the rain is not incessant. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and continues to the middle of April; the south-west monsoon lasts from April till October. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt.

Principal Towns

All are situated on the coast, and have good harbours:

- Jesselton (capital): 11,704
- Sandakan: 14,499
- Tawau: 4,282
- Victoria, Labuan: 2,526
- Kudat: 1,895

History

Early in the sixteenth century the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the bulk of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued, and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. The Sultan of Brunei offered the island of Labuan to the British Government in 1844 and in accordance with that offer the island was annexed in 1846, the cession being formally agreed to in a treaty with the Sultan in 1847. In 1872, after protracted negotiations, a large area on the mainland was ceded by the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory, and was made in perpetuity. In November 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Provisional Association, Limited, which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in 1882. This Company governed British North Borneo until January 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September 1945, and was under military administration until 15th July, 1946, when it became part of the new Crown Colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate colony from 1846 until 1890 and later as a settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new Colony of North Borneo on the same date under the Labuan Order in Council.

Constitution

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent under which a governor and commander-in-chief of the Colony is appointed. Under this instrument full sovereign rights are assumed over British North Borneo, following the North Borneo Cession Order in Council. The three instruments bear the date 10th July, 1946.

Authority was given under Letters Patent of 1950, for the establishment of a Legislative Council and Executive Council in and for the colony, in place of the Advisory Council which had existed hitherto, and an Order in Council brought into force on the 17th October, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council. It is presided over by the Governor and consists of three ex officio members, nine official members and ten nominated members. The Executive Council consists of three ex officio members, two official members and four nominated members.

Land Policy

Government's policy is to protect the interests of natives, who are given grants in perpetuity instead of leases for limited periods up to 99 years. There are two forms of land tenure: leases available to all, and Native Titles available to natives (who include all indigenous inhabitants). No lease for town land may be for more than 99 years. The area opened up by natives (excluding village reserves) is approximately 131,461 acres, almost all on individual title. All unalienated land is the property of the Crown.
Taxation

The two main forms of direct taxation are income tax and residents' tax. The scope of income tax is restricted to companies incorporated or registered in the colony or elsewhere and the rate of tax payable is 30%. With effect from 1st January, 1950, an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom Government for the avoidance of double taxation. The residents' tax legislation provides for all residents whose annual taxable incomes exceed $3,000 to pay tax ranging from 1% on incomes in excess of $3,000 to 12½% on those exceeding $100,000.

A poll tax of $1·50 per annum is paid by natives who do not pay to Government $3 or more annually by way of rent or boat or fishing licences.

The other main source of taxation is Customs import and export duties. The highest general rate on imports is 30% ad valorem on motor vehicles, the preferential rate being 10%. Manufactured goods are usually charged 10% and textiles and clothing 15% with a preferential rate of 7½%. The free list includes essential food-stuffs, building materials, and passengers' personal and household effects. Essential machinery and plant of British manufacture is also free of duty. The majority of goods exported are dutiable; 10% of the f.o.b. value is an average charge, but certain items are given special attention, e.g. rubber is charged 5% on the first $30 per pikul, 10% on the next $5 per pikul and 15% on the balance, allowance being made for freight, handling charges, etc. In addition a cess of ¼ cent per lb. is levied on all rubber exported, this revenue being utilized for the development of the rubber industry. Most of the timber exported is charged a royalty, but other timber is charged export duty in accordance with the Timber Roll.

Public Finance

From the re-establishment of civil government, following the liberation from Japanese occupation in July 1946, to the end of 1952 local revenue was in excess of recurrent expenditure. (Grants-in-aid totalling $16,642,858 and loans-in-aid amounting to $2,057,142 were provided by His late Majesty's Government up to the end of 1951 for purposes of reconstruction.) No grant or loan-in-aid was provided in 1952. In addition grants-in-aid totalling $4,700,000 have been made for ex gratia war damage compensation.

| Year | Revenue(a) | Expenditure |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1938 | $3,270,142 | $1,882,080   |
| 1948 | $8,043,016 | $10,856,092  |
| 1949 | $11,085,254| $17,010,242  |
| 1950 | $16,729,510| $17,185,527  |
| 1951 | $24,975,351| $18,649,053  |
| 1952 | $23,397,110| $29,403,945  |
| *1953| $22,538,000| $27,689,000  |

*Revised estimates.

(a) Excluding grants-in-aid, loans-in-aid, and Colonial Development and Welfare Grants.

(Expenditure excludes war damage compensation and Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes. The 1952 expenditure figure includes a non-recurrent item of $3·4 millions for buying up existing timber rights.)

The principal items of revenue in 1953 were estimated to be Customs $11,600,000, licences and internal revenue $5,700,000, forests $1,100,000. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were estimated to be:

- Marine—Public Works non-recurring: $9,600,000
- Police: $1,900,000
- Medical: $1,800,000
- Public Works Recurrent: $1,500,000
- Posts and Telegraphs: $1,300,000
- Education: $700,000

Currency

The currency in circulation consists mainly of Malayan currency, which was introduced by the British Military Administration immediately after the liberation of the territory, with a small quantity of British North Borneo Chartered Company notes and coin issued before the Japanese occupation. Chartered Company currency ceased to be legal tender on 31st August, 1953, but when handed into offices of the Treasury it will remain redeemable at its face value for Malayan currency. The buying and selling rates of the Malayan dollar fluctuate slightly in accordance with the Singapore market. For the purpose of conversion to sterling, the value of a dollar is taken at 2s. 4d.

Development Plans

A plan covering the reconstruction and development of North Borneo up to 1955 was drawn up in 1947 and totalled $19,138,989 for reconstruction and $28,382,375 for development. This plan was revised in 1950 and was linked to the Colombo Plan, the present position being that the total estimated cost of reconstruction will be $34,702,963 and for development, up to 1957, $74,168,949. The cost of reconstruction is being met mainly from Colony revenues with assistance from Her Majesty's Government in the form of a grant-in-aid. Up to the present $857,143 have been provided by Her Majesty's Government for this purpose. The financing of the development costs will be carried out with assistance from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, loans, Colony surpluses and assistance from E.C.A. towards the re-building of the main wharves of the Colony. The provisional amount allocated to North Borneo from Colonial Development and Welfare funds is $20,357,143. The development programme is made up as follows:

- Agriculture and multi-purpose projects: $26,468,511 (35·7%)
- Transport and Communications: $23,423,983 (32·0%)
- Mining: $199,586 (0·3%)
- Social Services: $24,076,869 (32·0%)

Under Agriculture the money is being spent on irrigation schemes, experimental stations, soil surveys, mechanical rice cultivation and livestock disease control. Under Transport and Communications improvements to the railway and the building of new roads, to open up new agricultural areas, and improved communications around the main centres, are in hand. Under Social Services a new Teachers' Training College and new hospitals have been built and there is slow but steady progress in the implementation of town plans, provision of new housing and accompanying services.

Other Development

Over and above work being undertaken by Government, the Colonial Development Corporation, in partnership with a local firm, are developing ex-Japanese hemp and rubber estates on the east coast.
In July 1952, the original timber concession which covered some 80% of the forest of the country, and which had existed for many years, was terminated, and a number of companies have now undertaken logging operations on new concessions under the control of the Forest Department.

**Education**

There are 71 primary and two post-primary Government schools; 46 primary schools and one secondary school receiving grants-in-aid; and 107 primary schools and one secondary school unaided by Government. The two Government post-primary schools are the Trade School with 21 pupils and the Teachers' Training College with 40 students. Eleven of the grant-aided primary schools have secondary classes and two of the unaided primary schools are Chinese with Junior Middle (secondary) classes. Of the 228 schools in the Colony, 118 are Chinese. The primary school course is of six years, with Malay, Chinese or English as the medium of instruction. Secondary schools are either Mission English schools with a five-year course, or Chinese Middle schools with a three-year course. The total enrolment of pupils is 22,991, of whom 7,049 are girls. This compares with 2,150 pupils in 1934. Of the present enrolment, 1,038 pupils are receiving secondary and 21,953 primary education.

No secondary technical and no post-secondary education is provided, but some 20 students are taking higher education courses overseas, about half of them with scholarships or fellowships under the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund, or the Colombo Plan.

In 1952 recurrent and special expenditure on education from Colony funds amounted to $505,562. There is one local authority which maintains its own schools and which spent approximately $5,800 in addition.

**Libraries**

There is a reference library in the Secretariat and reference and lending libraries are maintained at the headquarters of the Education Department and at the Information Office, Jesselton. The Information Office has organized branch libraries in a number of the smaller towns.

**Health**

The principal diseases are malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute respiratory disease, bowel infections and skin complaints. There are two general hospitals (100 beds); five outstation hospitals (32-45 beds); and 11 dispensaries (5-20 beds). The total number of beds is 473. There are also 12 dispensaries situated in outlying districts staffed by senior dressers under the supervision of District Medical Officers. In 1952 out-patients numbered 233,898, in-patients 10,476.

There is a mental hospital at Sandakan with 100 beds and a leprosy settlement on Berhala Island near Sandakan, which accommodates 100 patients. There are at present 58 in the settlement.

A health visitor is responsible for the supervision of the training and work of native midwives. Health centres, specializing in maternity work and child welfare, are maintained at Jesselton, Sandakan and Tawau and there are 20 subsidiary rural health clinics. In 1952 7,425 women and 16,086 children attended.

Recurrent and special expenditure on medical services from Colony funds in 1952 amounted to $1,576,038.

**Communications**

There are three civil airports, situated at Jesselton, Sandakan and Labuan, that at Labuan being of international standard. External services are provided by Malayan Airways from Singapore, Cathay Pacific Airways from Manila and Hong Kong, Qantas Empire Airways from Australia, Hong Kong and Tokyo, Air France from Indo-China and New Caledonia, and Garuda Indonesian Airways from Djakarta and Manila. In 1952 there were 3,458 movements of aircraft. An internal feeder service linking Labuan, Keningau, Ranau, Jesselton, Sandakan and Tawau was inaugurated in 1953. It is operated by Malayan Airways under a special arrangement with the Government.

In 1952, 470,000 passengers were carried on the railways and the weight of freight hauled was 34,000 tons. The total length of the railway, which is of metre gauge and serves the West Coast from Jesselton southwards and part of the interior, is 116 miles.

There are 162 miles of metalled roads with bitumen-sealed surface; 50 miles of other metalled roads; 192 miles of earth roads, and 572 miles of bridle paths.

The chief ports are Labuan, Sandakan, Jesselton, Kudat, Tawau and Lahad Datu. Ten shipping lines run services to and from the Colony as well as numerous other miscellaneous chartered vessels loading timber at Labuan and east coast ports. A regular feeder service to all ports in the Colony, Brunei and Sarawak is maintained by a fleet of seven coastal steamers and numerous small craft under 50 tons. Over 3,000,000 gross tons of shipping used the ports of the Colony in 1952 and the quantity of cargo handled was 571,643 tons.

**Broadcasting**

An experimental broadcasting station has been established ("Radio Sabah") which provides a regular lunch-time broadcast including news items in Chinese (Kuo-yu and Hakka), Malay and English. Plans are in hand for setting up a more adequate service with assistance from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. There are some 2,000 licence holders.

**Principal Occupations**

The 1951 census showed that 82,998 persons were engaged in smallholding agriculture, the bulk of whom were natives engaged in padi planting on their own account. Figures for other occupations were: rubber production 20,331; commerce 6,037; fishing 5,452; Government services (not including Railway Department) 4,225; timber 3,637; coconut, copra and coconut oil production 3,373; transport and communications 2,345; firewood and cutch 1,821; building 1,642.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are rubber, coconuts, rice and hemp. A high grade cigar wrapper leaf is grown for export by one large estate and a coarse variety is cultivated as a village industry.

The estimated livestock population is: pigs 74,600; buffaloes 61,500; cattle 13,000; goats 10,700; sheep 20; horses 2,700. A cattle farm, on co-operative lines, is being established.

The total output of timber in 1952 expressed in cubic feet quarter-girth round measurement was 7,614,786 cubic feet.
Investigations are being made into the possibility of increasing fresh water fish production. Eight ponds have already been constructed and stocked, with promising results. A total of 1,003 tons of marine products valued at $938,419 was exported during 1952.

A geological survey is being undertaken by a team of experts to determine the mineral wealth of the country and a large oil company is prospecting for oil.

| Year | Imports ($ million) | Exports ($ million) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1939 | 6·5                 | 13·5                |
| 1948 | 25·4                | 30·0                |

| 1952 | 70·3                | 64·7                |

Statistics are not available of origin of imports into the Colony. Original sources are difficult to state on account of the territory's dependence on supplies from the entrepôt markets of Singapore and Hong Kong. Similarly it is not possible to determine accurately the ultimate destination of all the Colony's exports.

During 1952 imports by countries of origin and the distribution of exports were estimated to be:

| Country          | Imports (%) | Exports (%) |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| United Kingdom   | 34%         | 29%         |
| Countries in South Asia | 26%       | 40%         |
| Asia             | 8%          | —           |
| Hong Kong        | 8%          | 10%         |
| Europe           | 7%          | 7%          |
| Australia        | 5%          | 2%          |
| Japan            | 5%          | 3%          |
| Philippines      | 2%          | —           |
| Canada           | 1%          | —           |
| U.S.A.           | —           | 7%          |
| Others           | —           | 2%          |
