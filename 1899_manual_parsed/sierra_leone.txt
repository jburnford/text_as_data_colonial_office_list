SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

Sierra Leone proper consists of a peninsula terminating in Cape Sierra Leone, and bounded on the north by a river of the same name. The Cape lies in 8° 30' N. lat., 13° 18' W. long. The peninsula is 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth, with an area of 300 square miles. The Colony now includes the whole of the coast southward to the Mannah River, which forms the Liberian boundary, and northward to the Skarcies district, as well as the island of Sherbro, the Isles de Los (Ruma, Factory, Tamaera, and Cockle Islands), and the Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellaboi, Cor-teemo, Tasso, Macaulay, and other islets.

The extreme length of the Colony is over 180 miles, and its area about 4,000 square miles (a little over half the size of Wales).

History.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone, was ceded to Great Britain in 1787 by the native chiefs. Four years afterwards a charter was granted to a Company under the name of "The Sierra Leone Company," for the purpose of establishing a settlement for freed negro slaves. In 1800 a grant of the peninsula was made to the Company by Letters Patent, and the Court of Directors of the Company was empowered to appoint a Governor and Council, the former having power to enact laws. In 1807, on the abolition of the slave trade, the Colony was transferred back to the Crown. In 1821, on the abolition of the African Company (see under Gold Coast), the whole of the British possessions in West Africa were united into the Colony of the West Africa Settlements. The Gold Coast was, however, soon abandoned to the merchants, and the Gambia was made a separate Colony in 1843.

In 1862 two large tracts of country called British Kwaias and Sherbro were handed over by treaty to the Colony. In 1879 further territory was acquired in the Skarcies River to the north of the peninsula. In 1884 the seaboard of the Sulymah and Gallinas Chiefs as far as the Mannah River was also annexed.

On August 31, 1896, a proclamation was issued of a Protectorate over the districts beyond the Colony extending to the Anglo-French and the Anglo-Liberian boundaries (comprising about 30,000 sq. miles), and ordinances were passed in 1896 and 1897 providing for the administration of the Protectorate. Under these ordinances a hut tax of 5s. was, with certain exemptions, collected in three provinces of the Protectorate (Ronietta, Karene and Bandijuma) at the beginning of 1898. Serious disturbances therupon occurred, and the Imperial troops in the colony assisted the colonial forces in the operations against the insurgents. Sir D. Chalmers was sent out in the summer as Special Commissioner to enquire into the causes of these outbreaks, and into the affairs of the colony generally.

Constitution.

By a Charter issued on May 27, 1863, an Executive Council was created, composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone, was established by a Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866.

By a new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, was revoked as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements; and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter was then issued dated 17th of December, 1874, which erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a legislative council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent were issued, dated 17th June, 1885, providing for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. Under these, the Governor of Sierra Leone is aided by an executive council composed of five officials. The legislative council, of which the Governor is ex officio president, is composed of the members of the executive council, as official members, and three unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

Climate.

The climate of Sierra Leone is unhealthy, especially for Europeans. The seasons are divided into wet and dry; the former commencing in May, and lasting till October. The beginning and ending of the wet season are the most sickly periods of the year. The average mean temperature is about 83°, the extreme range being from 64°5 to 100°6° in the shade.

The rain-fall during the past four years has averaged over 138 inches in Freetown.

General Description.

The capital, Freetown, lying about 4 miles up the Sierra Leone River at the foot of a chain of hills rising 1,700 feet, contains 30,033 inhabitants, and possesses the best harbour in West Africa. It is an important coaling station and commercial entrepôt, and has been selected as a second-class Imperial coaling station. It is a port of registry. The next largest towns are Waterloo in the Eastern District, and Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

The Colony contains many different races of inhabitants including a large number of Mahommedan negroes. Treaties of friendship have long existed with the native chiefs beyond British territory as far inland as Foutah, and annual stipends are paid to many of them in return for their protection of commerce and the internal roads.

The scenery is very like that of the West Indies. The soil is good for agricultural purposes, and there is an abundant supply of pure fresh water. Tropical fruits grow luxuriantly, and cattle and poultry are plentiful.

Industry.

The inhabitants are born traders, acting as middlemen, not only in the interior country behind Sierra Leone, but on the Niger and in all the commercial centres of West Africa, exchanging
European goods for the native products. Agriculture is much neglected, and there are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths, boat-building, tanning, and mat-making. The products of the interior, which constitute the principal exports, are palm oil and kernels, boni seed, ground nuts, cola nuts, indiarubber, copal, hides, and ginger. The imports are chiefly spirits, tobacco, cotton goods, furniture, and hardware. Three-quarters of the imports come from the United Kingdom, which only takes a third of the exports, the rest going to the other African settlements, France, Germany, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Besides British currency, gold doubloons, eagles, and the coins of the Latin union, are current and legal tender. There is no Colonial coinage, and no note circulation. The British Bank of West Africa has a branch in the Colony. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1832, and had, in 1892—32,842l. deposited, belonging to 2,643 depositors.

Education.

A system of Government grants and inspection was established in 1882. There are 89 elementary schools in the Colony, with 10,500 scholars; they are all denominational, and charge fees. Education is not compulsory. The Church Missionary Society has a successful secondary school in Freetown, and a training college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University. The Wesleyan Missionary Society possesses a progressive high school for boys. There are also in Freetown three high schools devoted to the task of female education.

Defence.

The headquarters of Her Majesty's Forces on the West Coast of Africa, consisting of a battalion of the West India Regiment (800 men), with detachments of Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery, and a company of Native Artillery, are stationed at Freetown. The West African Regiment was formed in 1898 from local recruits. There is also an establishment for victualling and coaling ships of the Royal Navy.

Batteries armed with heavy guns have been erected for the defence of Freetown harbour.

An armed police force, specially organised for frontier work, is maintained by the Colony, and numbers 574.

Means of Communication.

Steamers leave Liverpool for Grand Canary and Freetown every Saturday, and for Madeira and Freetown every second Wednesday. The average length of passage is 14 days to Freetown. There is also regular steam communication with Hamburg, Havre, and Marseilles, as well as with Lisbon and Algiers.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, direct to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively. There are no railways or internal telegraphs. Horses do not thrive, and there is but little wheel traffic and few roads fit for it. Internal communication is mainly kept up by the network of rivers and lagoons.

The Sherbro River is navigable for over 20 miles (up to Yorktown), the Sierra Leone, or Roquelle River, for 40 miles (as far as Magbellie).
