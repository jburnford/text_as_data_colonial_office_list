THE GAMBIA.
Situation and Area.
The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 18° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Colony on the river Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary, British Combo, Albreda, the Cedet Mile, and McCarthy's Island, situated between the falls of Barracuda and Bathurst, and 153 miles distant from the latter. This island forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river. The total area of the Colony proper is about 69 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey).

History.
The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators, but they made no settlement.

‡ With uniform and free quarters.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in Exeter to trade with the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed for this. It was not successful, and another established two years later also failed. In 1664 a fort was built on the island, now known as Fort James.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade (1807) till 1816, when a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary by British merchants from Senegal.

The right of trade was abandoned to England by France in the treaty of 1783, with the exception of a French factory which was subsequently established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. These two exceptional rights were exchanged in 1857.

From 1807 the settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821, till in 1843 it was treated an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

McCarthy's Island was purchased in 1823; the Cedet Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826 and 1832; St. Mary's Island was ceded in 1827; and British Combo was granted by the King of Combo in various sessions in 1840, 1850, and 1855.

Industry.
The principal productions of the settlement and of the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, beeswax, rice, cotton, maize, corn, palm kernels, indiarubber, wax, and native "pagns" or country cloths. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into native cloths called pagns, the manufacture of vegetable oils, boat building, and some brickmaking, there are no manufacturing industries in the country.

A considerable entrepôt trade is done with the French settlements and the adjoining coast districts, in cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, rice, cola nuts, and hardware.

In 1897 the imports and exports were as follows:

| Imports | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Weight  |       |
| Cotton goods | £56,983 |
| Tobacco | 6,110 |
| Cola Nuts | 21,885 |

| Hides | 180 |

Most of the exports go to France, but half of the imports come from England. Bathurst is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1897, 114 vessels registered, of 1,993 tons in the aggregate. The ground nut is the staple product of the Settlement. It is planted in June, and reaped in November, and largely exported to the South of Europe for the extraction of oil. The industry began in 1845, reached its climax in 1858, and has since declined, owing to the competition of other oil materials.

Relations with the Interior.

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the Protectorate by the Anglo-French Commissioners in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the Protectorate gradually into closer relationship with the Government of the Colony. An Order-in-Council, issued on the 23rd of November, 1893, provided for the establishment of Her Majesty's jurisdiction within the Protectorate, and since then an Ordinance has been passed providing for the establishment of magistrates and also native courts.

Travelling Commissioners regularly, during the eight months of dry weather, travel through the Protectorate on both banks of the river for 200 miles, and in Komombo and Fogni. Those parts of the Protectorate are gradually getting more under the immediate control of the Government. A "yard" or "hut" tax, which will average about 4s. per annum for a family, has been recently imposed in the Protectorate.

Stipends are paid and frequent presents made to the more influential chiefs, in return for their services in preserving peace and keeping the trade routes open.

In the early part of the year 1881 an expedition was made under the command of Dr. Gouldsbury, Administrator, for the purpose of ascertaining the capabilities of the upper river as a highway for trade between the coast and the interior, and of reaching Timbo, the capital of the extensive Fouta Jallon country. From thence the expedition returned to the coast at Sierra Leone, its report showing that but little extension of trade could be hoped for.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is that of the Latin Union; there is no Colonial coinage and no note issue. A Government savings bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st Dec., 1895, £2,563.1. deposited by 138 depositors, in 1896, £1,988.1. deposited by 154 depositors, but there are no private banks.

Education.

The schools, which are wholly in the hands of the several denominations, receive grants in aid. There is one Anglican school, 8 Mohammedan, 8 Wesleyan, and 2 Roman Catholic, with about 1,400 scholars in all. Education is not compulsory, and fees are charged.

Means of Communication.

The Liverpool mail steamers call every fortnight, and there is also communication via Dakar with Bordeaux. Four telegraph cables place Bathurst in communication with Europe and West Africa. There are no railways, internal telegraphs, or metalled roads, save one from Bathurst to Cape St. Mary 7½ miles across the Oyster Creek Bridge, which connects the island of St. Mary with the mainland of British Combo. Horse will live, and the river forms an unrivalled highway for 250 miles. A Government steamer now runs weekly to and from McCarthy's Island, stopping at intermediate places, carrying 1st-class passengers at 2d. per mile and deck passengers at 1d. per mile, letters at 1d. each, and affording freight and towage according to a fixed tariff.

The postage of letters to the United Kingdom, India, and certain Colonies* is 1d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is fairly healthy during the dry season. The mean temperature is 82°, the annual range being from 60° to 104°. The rainfall for 1897 was 33-61 inches, the rainy season being from June to October, and the cool Harmattan from November to February.

The inhabitants are mostly of the negro race, the chief tribes being the Jollofs, Mandingoos, and Jolahs. There are about 50 Europeans resident in the colony, out of a population, in 1881, of 14,150, and 14,266 in 1891. The town of Bathurst contains about 6,000 inhabitants. The population probably remains stationary, but the returns are not considered very reliable.

GIBRALTAR.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long high mountain called "The Rock," and a very flat sandy plain to the north of it raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, and called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,439 feet, its length is 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¼ of a mile. Its area is 1½ square miles.

History.

The rock of Gibraltar, the Mons Calpe of the ancients, remained under the dominion of the Moors until the 15th century, when it was incorporated with the Spanish kingdom of Granada. It was captured by the British forces under Sir George Rooke, 24th July, 1704, and was ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It was successfully defended by Gen. Eliot (afterwards Lord Heathfield) in the great siege of 1779-1783.

General Description.

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called the Bay of Gibraltar, which is about 4 or 5 miles across, and affords good anchorage for the shipping passing through the straits. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock are an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea and the sandy plain known as the North Front, which lies between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Linea; from the northern end the Rock runs along southward like a knife-edge to the ancient site of
O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind those latter lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only \( \frac{3}{4} \) mile. It is one of the most thickly inhabited places in the world, but it is not unhealthy. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden, called the Alameda. The civil population in the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south-east of the New Mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being entirely taken up with barracks, hospitals, &c., for the Military and the Navy.

Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and coaling station by shipping, and it is also an entrepôt of the trade between England and the Arabian states of Northern Africa, for which it has many advantages, having been ever since its occupation by the British a free port. Extensive works for an enclosed harbour are now in progress for the Admiralty, and also for the construction of three graving docks.

The northern end of the harbour is to be enclosed by a mole, built at the joint cost of the Imperial Government and the Colony, by which greatly increased facilities for coaling merchant ships and for landing and shipping cargo will be afforded. The works on this part of the harbour were begun in 1897, and considerable progress has been made. A contract has now been entered into for the completion of the scheme, which, it is estimated, will take 4½ years.

About 450 persons are employed in tobacco manufactories, and about 1,200 in the coal depôts. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1896, 30 vessels, of together 5,171 tons. No statistics of imports or exports are taken.

The revenue is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, duties upon wine, spirits, beer, and tobacco, and licence duties and fees.

There is no executive council nor any legislative body. The Governor, who is also the General commanding the garrison, exercises by himself all the functions of government and legislation. The management of the drainage, water supply, &c., is in the hands of a nominated body, called the Sanitary Commissioners. Their receipts for 1897 were 1,113,602 pesetas, and their expenditure 1,106,655 pesetas, and their debt on the 31st of Dec., 1897, 1,984,000 pesetas.

There is a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, and several private bankers.

A Government savings bank was founded in 1882, and had on 31st Dec., 1897, 5,024,723 pesetas deposited by 4,422 depositors. Since the 1st Oct., 1898, the legal tender currency has been that of the United Kingdom, and the public accounts are now kept in it. The change from Spanish currency, which had previously been the legal tender, was effected under the provisions of the Orders in Council of the 9th of August, 1898.

There is daily postal communication with England by way of Spain and Franco. Rates of postage: letters 1d. per ¼ oz., newspapers ½d.* The internal postage rate is ½d. per ½ oz. There are also branch post offices worked by the Gibraltar postal administration at Tangier, Tetuan, Larache, Rabat, Casablanca, Safi, Mazagan Mogador and Fez in Morocco, and direct telegraphic communication with Spain, and by cables to Tangier, Malta, Lisbon, and Cadiz.

Education is not compulsory. There are fourteen elementary poor schools subsidised by Government, and several private schools, the number of scholars on average attendance being 1,867 for the year ending 30th March, 1898. The Government aided schools are chiefly managed by the clergy of the different denominations, and small fees are charged.

Defence.

As an important naval station, Gibraltar is strongly fortified, the whole area forming one large citadel. There is a permanent garrison of about 5,000 men. The naval establishment, exclusive of crews of port guard ships, numbers at present about 250, but is being increased. The Admiralty are constructing large dry docks, and works to provide an enclosed harbour are being rapidly pushed forward.
