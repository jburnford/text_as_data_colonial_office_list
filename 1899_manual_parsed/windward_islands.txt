THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago was united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889, and in 1898 became a Ward of that Island. The remaining three British Colonies are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and its population about 154,743.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Carribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government; the
Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

**Constitution.**

Each island retains its own institutions, and when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. A common audit system was instituted in 1889.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling doubloons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

**Communications.**

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 13 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Barbados for the purpose of transhipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call at least once a month, and there is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York, Grenada being the first and last port of call.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telephone system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cable to St. Thomas and St. Croix. The rate per word for telegrams to Europe from Grenada is 4s. 11½d.

**GRENADA.**

**Situation, Area, &c.**

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 58 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population (in 1891) of 6,190 souls.

**General Description.**

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and bushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Étang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the
level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. All the roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. There are about 40 miles of driving road in various directions, and a perfect network of byways, all in good order, provides for the important item of inland communication. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping, and had on 31st December, 1897, 75 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,061 tons; its fine harbour, owing to its situation, healthiness, and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call and coaling station for steamers. The town has a population of 5,000.

The other towns in the island are Charlotte Town (or Gouyave), Victoria (or Grand Pauvre), Sauteurs; and Grenville (or La Baye). English is universally spoken, but the peasantry speak among themselves a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race, except the East Indian population, which amounts to about 2,000 souls.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. Yellow fever, the bugbear of the West Indies, is almost unknown, and if new arrivals do get a touch of "acclimatizing fever," which is far from being the rule, it is mild and soon disappears. The average annual rainfall at St. George's for the last five years is 82.49 inches, and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer for the last five years are 90° and 67° respectively, the average mean temperature being 79.5° in the shade. The rainfall in other parts of the island is much greater; at the Grand Etang, in 1897, it was 200 inches.

The island is a great health resort for the neighbouring colony of Trinidad, and in addition to the restoring influence of the climate it affords excellent sea bathing.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. Unlike the other islands however it has long ceased to be a sugar producing colony, and has therefore not suffered so severely as they have from the depreciation in the value of cane sugar. There are very few sugar estates at present in cultivation. The chief produce of Grenada is, and has been for some time, cocoa, of which 65,849 cwt., of the total value of 132,642l., were shipped in 1897. When the above shipment is compared with the shipments of 1885 (49,107 cwt.) and 1880 (42,154 cwt.), it will be seen that the cultivation of cocoa has increased, but the shipment for 1897 is greatly below that of 1896, which was 90,198 cwt., value 159,519l. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such for instance as coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, cocoanuts, &c. Nutmeg cultivation now occupies a prominent position, and is being largely developed. So general is the cultivation of spices carried on here that Grenada is already called "The Spice Island of the West." The export of spices has increased from 3,483l. in 1880, to 13,503l. in 1897. Tropical fruits of almost every description, and of the finest quality, are always abundant, and large quantities are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, taroas, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, &c. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and all the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullet wood, locust, mahogany, white cedar, galba, &c., and large quantities of firewood are exported to Barbados. A considerable quantity of rum is manufactured for local consumption, the total number of gallons in 1897 being 52,895.

The main imports are food stuffs, textiles, timber, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are Indian corn, cotton, and cotton seed, ground nuts, hides and skins, whale oil, and live stock (principally goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry).

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,658; estimated acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, under cultivation, 22,050.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George, established in 1881, with 651 depositors and 4,937l. deposited at the 31st Dec., 1897. Branch banks were opened in the out districts on 1st April, 1889; the number of depositors on 31st December, 1897, was 317 and 2,434l. deposited.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1795–6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated and assisted by the French. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred in cold blood, and the Colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercromby suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the African slaves.

Constitution.

There was originally a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members.
Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the Legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council was established by the Queen, which now consists of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The unofficial members hold their seats for six years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, under which Grenada was made the head-quarters of the Government.

Education.

There are 9 Government elementary schools, and 27 aided schools. The latter are under the local management of the ministers of the different religious sects. Building grants have been made by the Government to assist in establishing schools in districts requiring them, and annual grants in aid are made on the result of inspections. The central administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1888 an Ordinance was passed imposing upon parents as a legal obligation the duty of providing elementary education for their children. In 1897 the average attendance was 8,943 children, the number on the rolls being 7,585. Fees are charged in all schools. There is a grammar school for boys, and two schools for the secondary education of girls, all of which receive grants in aid from the general revenue.
