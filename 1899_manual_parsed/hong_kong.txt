HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton, between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles (a third larger than Guernsey). It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (2½ square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutter's, Green, Apleechow, Middle, Round, and other islets.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with the Chinese Government for the extension of Hong-Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwong-tung, including Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be leased for 99 years; a stipulation was included that within the city of Kowloon (which lies outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials then stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong-Kong but that within the remainder of the newly-leased territory Great Britain should have sole jurisdiction. The area of the mainland leased is 286 square miles.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The City of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains, with its suburbs, more than 200,000 inhabitants. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees.

The rainfall for 1897 was 100-030 inches at the Observatory Station, while the range of the thermometer was from 41°02 to 91°8°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843.

It did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1897 being 178,038 (principally to and from the Straits); emigrants, 62,831; immigrants, 115,207.

Industry.

The island produces little or nothing, but its position has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are a few manufactories, producing rope, sugar, rum, paper, vermilion, sauce, bricks, and bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping.

As Hong Kong is a free port, it is impossible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected may be approximately estimated from the amount of the shipping. The exports from the fourteen principal countries to Hong Kong amounted in 1885 to 21,869,145l., and the imports into those countries from Hong Kong were 18,685,181l. Since that date the trade has greatly increased, and the total exports may now be estimated roughly at 25 millions, and the imports at 20 millions sterling. Nearly half of this trade is with China, and a third with India, mainly in tea, silk, and opium.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. There are five docks and three slips
which are well supplied with shears, engineer's and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every requirement for making repairs to large ships of war and merchant vessels. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company was aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885, under The Colonial Docks Act.

Currency and Banking.

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 2nd Feb., 1895):

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. British dollar.
3. The Hong Kong dollar, half-dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
   Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
4. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint 2,108,054 dollars, and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of $402,671. There have been obtained from England, and put into circulation up to 31st Dec., 1897, subsidiary coins (which now include half-dollars) to the nominal value of $18,435,125. Importation of copper coins has been discontinued.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now, and of the coins imported from England it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent, remain in the Colony.

There are six principal banks (Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Mercantile Bank of India, Ltd., China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, National Bank of China, the Bank of China, Japan, and the Straits, and the Yokohama Specie Bank), having a note circulation of $9,394,444 on 31st Dec., 1897. There is no savings bank under Government control, but one conducted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. The Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris has an agency in the Colony.

Local weights and measures are the following:

1 tael = 14 oz.; 1 picul = 133 lbs.; 1,000 Chinese cash =

Means of Communication.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly the whole world by a cable to Shanghai (and thence to Japan and Russia) and two cables to Singapore via Saigon and Hue respectively; and there is very extensive steam communication with Europe, America, and Australia.

In addition to the regular mail lines of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Messageries Maritimes which convey the European mails weekly, the Pacific Mail Steam Navigation Company have a fortnightly service, via Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco, and the Eastern and Australian Mail Steam Company and the China Navigation Company have a frequent service to the Australian Colonies. The Norddeutsche Lloyd and the Austrian Lloyd steamers go to and from Europe monthly, and the Canadian Pacific Mail Company have a three-weekly service to Europe via Vancouver and the Canadian Pacific Railway; also the Portland Line of steamers have a monthly service to Portland, Oregon, touching at Japanese Ports, and Victoria, British Columbia. Letters from England reach Hong Kong in about 31 days.

There is daily steam communication between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton, and almost daily with Swatow, Amoy, Foo Chow, Shanghai, and other ports on the coast of China. The communication with Japan is three or four times a week. There are no railways (but a cable tramway from the city to the higher levels was opened in 1888); and no internal telegraph communication except for police and military purposes.* The island possesses few roads, and the usual means of conveyance outside Victoria is by boat. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. |
|------------------|
| Hong Kong, Canton, and Macao | 2 cents |
| United Kingdom, India, and certain Colonies† | 4 " |
| Europe, America, and Australasia | 10 " |
| South Africa | 20 " |

The postal agencies in China at Canton, Swatow, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo, Hankow, and Hoilhow are under the superintendence of the postmaster at Hong Kong.

Education.

There is the Queen's College (a secondary Government Boys' School, with low fees) a Police school and a Reformatory, and 10 free Government schools (8 teaching English). A Government Girls' School was opened in 1890. Besides these, there are 98 grant-in-aid-schools, 90 of which are free, belonging to 10 different Missionary Societies. These are denominational, the Government schools being strictly secular. There were 11,177 scholars on the rolls in 1897. The only central administrative organisation is the education department in charge of the Inspector of Schools. The languages taught are English, Portuguese, and two separate dialects of Chinese. Some scholarships have been founded by Government and by private individuals for higher education. There is one school for industrial education, and a college of medicine for Chinese.

Revenue.

One-fourth of the revenue is derived from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes, 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria, 10½ per cent. in the Hill Districts, ¾ per cent. at Kowloon, and 7 per cent. in the outlying villages, payable by the owners. The remainder is derived from opium and other licences, land revenue, stamps and fees.

Defence.

There is an Imperial garrison of about 2,870 men, including the Hong Kong Regiment, which arrived in 1891, towards the cost of which the Colony contributes 40,000l. annually. There is also a Volunteer Corps (Artillery and Maxim Guns) with about 85 honorary and 85 effective members. The port is the head-quarters of the China Squadron of some 30 vessels, and there is usually at least one war vessel present. Land batteries of powerful armament have been erected with the view of protecting the town and anchorage. There is an armed police 666 strong, of whom 126 are Europeans, 211 Sikhs, and the rest Chinese.

Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19 Jan., 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six official and two unofficial members besides the

* There are telegraph lines connected with the Gap Rock and Cape d'Aguilar Lighthouses, in connection with the signalling of ships, &c.

† See list on p. 21.
Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of seven official and six unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (two being usually Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 13 of 1873.
