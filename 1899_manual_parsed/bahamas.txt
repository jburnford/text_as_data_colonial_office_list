BAHAMAS.

Situation and Area.

The Bahamas, the most northerly of the British West Indian Colonies, are a chain of coral islands lying between 21° 42' and 27° 34' N. lat., and 72° 40' and 79° 5' W. long., composed of about 20 inhabited islands, and an immense number of islets and rocks. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Mayaguana, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, and the Bimini, all of which are ports of entry; and Great Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklin Island, Cat Island, Watling's Island, once known as St. Salvador, the Berry Islands, and Andros Island (containing the only river). The total area is 4,466 square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

History.

St. Salvador, so-called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines, and the islands were abandoned. They were included in the charter given by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578, but no visit was made to them or occupation effected, and in 1612 they were nominally attached to Virginia. Settlers from the Bermudas found their way in considerable numbers to Eleuthera, in 1646, and in 1666, some years later, also to New Providence. This latter island, and all the others between 22° and 27° N. lat. were granted by Charles II to a proprietary body in 1670, and in 1671 Captain Johnson Wentworth was appointed by the proprietors to be their first Governor. No regular system of government appears to have been established however, and New Providence continued to be more or less merely a shelter for pirates and a disorderly set of people. It was laid waste by the Spaniards in 1680 or 1682, and in 1703 the French and Spaniards combined annihilated the settlement. After this it became a regular rendezvous for pirates, who were finally extirpated in 1718 by the English, under Captain Woodes Rogers, and a regular administration formed and colonists introduced, including a considerable number of Germans from the Palatinate. In 1781 the Bahamas were surrendered to the Spaniards, but at the conclusion of the war they were once more annexed by Great Britain, which was confirmed in their possession at the Peace of Versailles, 1783.

In 1848 the Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, were separated from the other Bahamas, and formed into a distinct Presidency, under the Government-in-Chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is very pleasant and salubrious in the winter season, and the Colony has in recent years been much frequented by visitors from the United States and Canada—there being an excellent hotel, owned by the Colonial Government, and other accommodation for tourists. The annual rainfall is 45 inches, the rainy season extending from June to October. The mean temperature is 79·5 degrees, the extreme range being from 54·7 to 96·2.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race. About one quarter are of European descent; English is universally spoken.

Trade and Industry.

The commercial relations of the Colony are mainly with the United States. Considerable quantities of pine-apples and oranges are exported. In 1896 the value of oranges, lemons, &c., and other fruits was 4,586£.; in 1897 404,855 dozens of pine-apples were exported, valued at 24,581£.

Cotton, the cultivation of which was introduced by Royalist refugees from the United States, was grown in large quantities prior to the abolition of slavery, and also during the American War, but has ceased to be a staple. The cotton exported in 1897, was only valued at 76£.

The cultivation and preparation of the sisal fibre plant has been stimulated recently, and the quantity and value exported in 1897 was 901,787 lbs., value 4,522£. The area planted at the end of 1896 was 20,000 acres.

The sugar-cane grows luxuriantly in many of the islands, but is little cultivated.

The Colony enjoyed great prosperity during the American Civil War, when it was the headquarters of many blockade running operations.

Fishing is extensively carried on, over 100 native-built boats, with 500 men, being employed. Shells and pearls are largely exported. Sponge-fishing employs a large fleet, 89,111£., worth being shipped in 1897. Nassau is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1897, 624 ships registered, of 27,251 tons.

Salt-raising, one of the earliest industries, has fallen off of late, the export of salt in 1897 being only 1,501£., as compared with 2,470£. in 1890. Some of the islets yield guano. The chief imports are textile fabrics, bread stuffs, spirits, and wines.

Lighthouses on several of the islands have been established, and are maintained, by the Imperial Government at a cost of 13,000£. per annum, exclusive of stores supplied from England.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, United States current coin, silver of the Latin Union, and gold doubloons. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is no Colonial currency. A local bank, called the Bank of Nassau, was established on 1st June, 1889. It had on 31st December, 1897, a note issue of 5,500£., and deposits amounting to 29,354£. A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had on 31st December, 1897, 9,523£. deposited.

Means of Communication.

There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony, and but few good roads except in New Providence. There is regular fortnightly mail communication with New York and Cuba, and frequent vessels to and from Cuba and Key West. Till February, 1892, the nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe was Key West, but in that month a cable from Nassau to Florida was completed. The rates of postage are—

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|------------|
| Internal | 1d.        | Free       |
| U.K., India, and certain Colonies* | 1d. per 2 oz. | 1d. per 2 oz. |
| Postal Union Countries | 2½d. | 1d. per 2 oz. |
| Elsewhere | 4d. | |

A parcels post with the United Kingdom and the United States has been established.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is conducted, under Letters Patent, by the Governor aided by an

* See list on p. 27. A reduction on parcels exchanged with the U.K. came into force on 1st July, 1899 (p. 27).
Executive Council of 9 members. The Legislative authority resides in the Governor, a Legislative Council of 9 members, nominated by the Crown and a Representative Assembly of 29 members, elected for 14 districts by persons owning land of the value of £1., or occupying houses of the rental value of 2l. 8s. in New Providence, or half that amount in the outlying islands. The qualifications of Electors are full age, a residence of 12 months, with land value £1.; or being a householder of premises value 2l. 8s. in New Providence, or 1l. 4s. elsewhere, for six months. The qualification of Members is possession of an estate of real or personal property of the value of 200l. The Executive Council is composed partly of official and partly of unofficial Members, who have a seat in one of the branches of the Legislature.

Education.

There is a Government system of elementary education, established 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, 1885, 1886, 1888, and 1889. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local Committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.

There are 43 unsectarian Government schools, with 5,777 scholars; 11 aided schools, with 958 scholars; 81 Church of England and 28 private schools, with 2,472 scholars. The Government schools were made free in 1885. The compulsory clauses of the law are enforced only in Nassau and the larger villages. Higher education is provided at the Nassau Grammar School, the Queen's College, and St. Hilda's School, all in Nassau.
