NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the Middle, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the colony: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 536 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43°-45° S. lat., 176°-177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island is 44,468 square miles, of the Middle Island, 58,525 square miles, of Stewart Island, 665 square miles, and small outlying groups of islands, 813 square miles, a total area of 104,471 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 and 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. longitude, and 33° and 53° S. latitude, are annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, were annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal is Raoul or Sunday, and Macaulay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands is administered through the Governor of New Zealand. (See Appendix to Pt. II.)

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (56°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (51°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington is 50°, from 82° in summer to 32° in winter. The rainfall varies from a mean for the year of 25 inches on the east coast, to 112 inches on the west coast of the Middle Island, and from 37 inches on the east coast, to 59 inches on the west coast of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the 10 years 1888-97 was 28·14 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 9·75. The birth rate has been gradually declining, and in 1897 was 25·96 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 9·14.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840, the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaii, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1896, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 89,854, all of whom dwelt in the North Island, with the exception of 2,523 scattered over the other islands.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1850.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 and 16 Vic., cap. 72. By that Act the Colony was divided into six provinces, subsequently increased to nine—viz.—Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.
By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vic., No. XXI, passed in 1876, the provincial system of Government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished provision was made for the division of the colony into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, consisting of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Colony for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments are tenable for seven years only. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector is qualified to become a member. The House of Representatives now consists of 74, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to September.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 150l. a year, payable monthly.

Members of the House of Representatives receive 20l. a month, amounting to 240l. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races), the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Colony and three months in one electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral role.

In 1889 an amendment of the Representation Act was passed, which contained a provision prohibiting any elector from giving his vote in respect of more than one electorate at any election; and by the Electoral Act, 1893, no person is entitled to be registered on more than one electoral roll, whatever the number or nature of qualifications he or she may possess, or wherever they may be.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a ratepayer's one. Women ratepayers can vote as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the Colonial Government. In 1865, the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Colony is divided into 97 municipalities and 81 counties; the latter being subdivided into 244 road districts and 39 town districts. For the year ended 31st March, 1897, the total receipts of the various local authorities amounted to £1,196,893l., and their expenditure to £1,228,542l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to £2,889,837l. For the year ended 31st December, 1896, the receipts, expenditure and debt of Harbour Boards amounted to £393,404l., £388,466l., and £3,703,561l. respectively, and of the Christchurch Drainage Board (the only one in existence) to £20,195l., £19,708l., and £200,000l. respectively.

Education.

A Government system of education was established by Law No. 21 of 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of Education Boards and of School Committees, with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of schools on 31st December, 1897, 1,585; number of scholars on roll, 132,197. The schools are free and non-sectarian, and education is compulsory. The University of New Zealand examines and confers degrees and gives scholarships. It has a statutory endowment of 3,000l. a year. There are three colleges for university teaching, at Dunedin, Christchurch, and Auckland. The last-named has a statutory endowment of 4,000l. a year; the other two have landed endowments. In December, 1897, an Act was passed by the General Assembly establishing, in commemoration of the sixtieth year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, for the promotion of higher education, a college at Wellington, to be styled "The Victoria College," and to be in connection with the New Zealand University. It is governed by a Council of sixteen members. Three of these are appointed by the Governor in Council. There are twenty-four secondary schools, endowed with land or funds arising from public sources. The pupils at these schools numbered 2,709 on 31st December, 1897.

Technical Education.—An act intituled "The Manual and Technical Elementary Instruction Act" for the promotion of manual and technical instruction was passed in 1895. During 1897 the Government distributed 2,166l. in aid of various technical schools and classes. The examination of the Science and Art Department (South Kensington), and the City and Guilds of London Institute are made use of, and 615 passes in various subjects, theoretical and practical, were obtained in 1896. There are four fully-equipped schools of art attended during the year by about 1,380 students. There are also two Government Schools of Mines; and in connection with the Canterbury College there is an endowed School of Engineering and Technical Science. The Canterbury Agricultural College possesses extensive buildings, has a large endowment of land and an experimental farm of very complete character. Thirty-eight students attended in the second term of 1897.

There were also at the same date 74 schools for natives, maintained at the cost of the Government and under the direct control of the Minister, and 4 denominational boarding schools. The numbers at the boarding schools were 238, of whom 75 were supported by Government; and at the other schools 2,864.

The number of pupils in the Deaf Mute Institution was 47; the greatest part of the cost is defrayed by the Government; 1,588 children belong to the authorised industrial schools, of whom 581 were in the schools, 396 boarded out, and the rest were with friends, at service, &c., under licence.

To the school for the blind, under the management of a local society, the Government contributes a subsidy to the extent, approximately, of 24s. for each 20s. subscribed, and pays 20l. a year.
for each pupil whom it sends to the school. There were 16 such pupils at the end of 1896.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 12th April, 1896, was found by the census to be 703,360 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 39,854.

The population of the chief towns on the 28th March, 1886; 5th April, 1891, and 12th April, 1896, was as follows:

| Year | City | City and Suburbs |
|------|------|------------------|
| 1886 | Wellington | 25,945 |
|      | Dunedin | 23,243 |
|      | Auckland | 33,161 |
|      | Christchurch | 15,265 |

|      | Christchurch | 41,688 |

Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Colony up to 31st December, 1897, was valued at £53,672,634l.; and the annual production is about one million sterling. The wool exported in 1897 amounted to 135,835,117 lbs., valued at £4,413,144l. In 1855 it amounted to 1,772,344 lbs., valued at £93,104l. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at £19,339l., had developed an export for 1889 of 656,822 cwt., valued at £783,374l., in 1890 of 898,894 cwt., valued at £1,087,617l., in 1891 of 1,000,307 cwt., valued at £1,194,724l., in 1892 of 869,600 cwt., valued at £1,039,377l., in 1893 to 903,836 cwt., valued at £1,085,167l., in 1894 to 1,025,248 cwt., valued at £1,194,545l., in 1895, 1,134,097 cwt., valued at £1,262,711l., in 1896, 1,103,362 cwt. valued at £1,251,993l., and in 1897, 1,407,921 cwt., valued at £1,566,286l.

The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1898, were: Horses, 252,834, against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 1,209,165, against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 19,687,954*, against 11,704,853 in 1874. The number of acres under cultivation in February, 1898, was 1,517,222, exclusive of 9,866,549 acres in sown grasses; 315,801 acres were in wheat, having an estimated yield of 5,670,017 bushels; 354,819 acres were in oats, estimated yield 9,738,391 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttleton, Napier, Nelson, and Wellington are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1897, 506 vessels registered, of 87,349 (not) tons in the aggregate.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware, and machinery, sugar, tea, alcohol, books, and stationery; and they are obtained almost entirely from England, Australia, the United States, and China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches in the Colony:—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, and Bank of Australasia. The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand on 31st Dec., 1897, was 13,828,437l., and of their note circulation 1,015,040l. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Colony, having now 388 branches; the amount deposited therein on 31st December, 1897, was 4,744,925l. The private savings banks number seven, and the total amount to credit of depositors at the end of 1897 was 775,155l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Government Life Insurance Department.

This department was constituted, on the initiative of Sir J. Vogel, by legislative enactments passed in 1869 and 1870, and commenced to transact business in March of the latter year. Its constitution was subsequently modified by Act, passed in 1874, 1884, 1886, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1892, and 1894. By the Act of 1886 an official board to control and manage the investment of a portion of the department's funds in mortgages on land is now constituted. This board consists of the Colonial Treasurer, the Solicitor-General, the Surveyor-General, the Commissioner of Taxes, the Public Trustee, and the Government Insurance Commissioner. The Act empowers loans on mortgage not exceeding 10,000l. to any one person or company. All policies are guaranteed by the State.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the premium rates are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first class lives to the amount of 4,000l. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves.

A reference to the table hereunder will show the scale of premiums charged for the principal classes of business transacted, the amount of profits which have been divided amongst the policy holders, and the rapid growth of the office.

The last valuation was made upon the nominal basis of Hm 4 per cent., but a sum of 81,000l. was specially reserved, making the valuation virtually equivalent to one upon a basis of Hm 3½ per cent.

**Public Works Policy.**

As in most of the Colonies, all the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony, and in the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement. But in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under local boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1898, there were 2,055 miles of Government and 167 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand; and 92 miles of Government and 21 miles of private lines under construction.

The expenditure on the 2,055 miles of Government railways has been 15,993,903l., or an average of 7,783l. a mile; this includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1897-98 was 1,376,008l., and the working expenses 857,191l. The balance of 518,817l. is equal to a return of 3l. 4s. 10d. per cent. on the capital invested. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraphs there are now 6,484 miles of land lines and 18,024 miles of wire, constructed at a cost of 771,351l. There are three submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand, and one connecting the Colony with Australia and the rest of the civilized world. In the year ending 31 March, 1898, excluding value of Government messages, the revenue was 136,221l.; number of messages 2,696,233 (of which number 2,469,415 were private or press messages). The principal towns have telephone exchanges. In March, 1898, there were 18 exchanges and 11 sub-exchanges in operation.

Ordinary tramways have been established in all the principal towns in New Zealand, and Dunedin has in addition two cable lines leading to high-lying suburbs. The ordinary tramways are in some cases worked by steam motors, but horse-power is more generally employed. The cable tramways are practically on the same system as those in San Francisco.

The Government has expended about 598,000l. on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels on the goldfields.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations. Auckland, Napier, and Lyttelton have pumping schemes, but the others are supplied by gravitation. All the principal towns in the Colony have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas. In Wellington the streets are illuminated by the electric light, as are also the parliamentary buildings and many private business establishments.

The coasts of the Colony are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Lyttelton, Greymouth, Westport, New Plymouth, and Napier. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.

The Public Works of the Colony, including both railways and roads, and the erection of public buildings, are now principally carried out on what is known as the co-operative system,—that is, the Government provides all materials and lots the work of construction or erection to parties of artisans and labourers at rates fixed by the officers of the Government, and calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 9s. to 12s. per day for artisans and from 7s. to 8s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day.

**Mail Communication.**

There is regular mail communication with England by six routes (direct and via San Francisco, Vancouver, Brindisi, Naples, and Marseilles), and with all Australasian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States, Canada and Brazil. The rates of postage are:

- Letters, per ½ oz. Newspapers.
  - Within a town . . . 1d. ½d. each.
  - Colony . . . 2½ "
  - Australasia . . . 2½ "
  - England and Countries in Postal Union . . . 2½ per 2oz., with minimum of 1d.

**Defence.**

Proposals made by Sir W. F. D. Jervois and Major-General H. Schaw for fortifying the ports of Auckland, Wellington, Lyttelton, and Dunedin, by strong batteries and a complete system of submarine mines, are now being carried into execution. At each of the above-named ports torpedo boats fitted for Whitehead torpedoes are also provided.

**QUEENSLAND.**

**Situation and Area.**

Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the Colony.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the Colony of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,838,080 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).
History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1828, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was however not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from Nov. to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the 21st parallel of south latitude, and thence west to the western boundary. Another range branches from the main range about lat. 21° south and long. 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Sugar growing has now become a very important industry. In 1897 there were 98,641 acres under cane, of which 65,432 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 97,916 tons of sugar.

Maize was grown on 109,721 acres, and returned a yield of 2,803,172 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1897, 755 acres yielded 638,736 lbs. of cured leaf. Manufactured in the colony during the year, 583,251 lbs.; cigars, 1,733 lbs.; cigarettes, 13,109 lbs.

In 1897 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 391 acres, which yielded 2,888 tons of tabor, and 367,830 lbs. of manufactured arrowroot were made from a portion of this at the factories. A considerable portion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba, Warwick, and Roma, on the Darling Downs. In 1897, 66,099 acres were planted with this cereal, principally in the localities mentioned. Out of the total area planted, 5,898 acres were mown for hay, and 59,875 acres yielded 1,009,293 bushels of grain; 326 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the Colony, and there are 2,918 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 384,246 sq. miles, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

The chief exports are: Wool, 76,360,239 lbs., valued at 2,509,842l.; gold, 2,568,702l.; sugar, 681,083l.; live stock, 828,089l.; tin, 36,670l.; silver, 62,801l.; meat, 985,692l.; meat extract, 92,256l.; hides and skins, 437,558l.; tallow, 272,528l.; green fruit, 87,450l.; copper, 21,388l.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour hardware, and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important ones in the Colony, and gives employment to over 25,000 men. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district which includes the famous Mt. Morgan mine, Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in twenty-four districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total quantity of gold exported during 1897 amounted to 813,204 ozs. The Herberton district is the headquarters of the silver, tin, and copper mining industries, but the districts of Cooktown, Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, and Sellheim also contribute largely to the output of the baser metals, amongst which also should be mentioned bismuth, antimony, wolfram, and quicksilver. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the colony. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burram and Peak Downs; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1897 was 358,407 tons, valued at 139,889l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hardwood, which is most in demand: flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton

* Beech and yellow wood are hard wood timbers.
Bay pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the Eucalyptus is coming largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1897, 228 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 22,758.

Water Supply.

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the Colony, of which a large portion has been repaid leaving at the end of 1897 an indebtedness to the Government of 792,850l.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 668,497 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 509 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from 4,010 feet; the depth of the Government bore at Winton to 45 feet. The aggregate quantity of boring done in search of artesian water amounts in all to 604,277 feet; 344 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons to 152 gallons per bore, and the aggregate total output is nearly 200,000,000 of gallons per diem. Generally stated the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 245 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 196° to 70° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at nearly three-quarters of a million sterling exclusive of the cost of casings which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000l., so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amount expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the colony and already about 7,000 acres are artificially watered by some 120 irrigationists. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,858 persons, an increase of 51-20 per cent. in 5 years, and the census of 5th April, 1891, shows the population to be about 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,939 females; Chinese about 8,574, Polynesians about 9,428, and other Asiatic races about 1,832. The balance of the population are mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. This does not include aborigines, of whom there are believed to be about 30,000 in the Colony.

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 37 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 498,000. The receipts of the local authorities, including Divisional Boards, in 1897 were 539,585l.; their expenditure 510,437l.; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control 42,042,587l., and debt 1,620,871l. Debts for water works, amounting to 800,002l., which are due principally from these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the colony, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had at the end of 1897 an estimated population of 105,734 (five mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast, and the climate during the greater part of the year is healthy and enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (11,275), Ipswich (7,625), Maryborough (10,000), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (18,565), Gympie (11,750), and Toowoomba (10,600).

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1897, 11 banks, with 155 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as 2,095,598l.; deposits, 11,869,982l. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 63,310; the amount of deposits as 2,568,477l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

On the 31st December, 1897, the railways in Queensland showed 2,609 miles in operation, the cost of construction being 17,871,445l., besides 144,705l. expended on lines in course of progress, the revenue 1,122,637l., and the working expenses 688,033l. The following lines are now open for traffic:

THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN from Brisbane to Wyandra; with its branches, Ipswich to Dugandan, Brisbane Valley Junction to Esk, Gowrie Junction ria Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crows Nest, Wyreema to Pittsworth, Hendon to Allora, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to Norang, with branches to Beandercat, Southport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Gladstone, with branches to Pinkenba, Sandgate, Degilbo, Kilkivan, Pialba, Cordalba, and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre.

THE CENTRAL RAILWAY is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches to Moonerra, Springsure and Clermont; also one to Broadmount and to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.
From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 23 miles of railway are open to Mirani, with a branch to Eton opening up good agricultural land.

The Bowen Railway is also open from that port to Wangaratta, a distance of 48 miles.

The Northern Railway is open from Townsville to Stamford, with a branch to Ravenswood, having been carried past Charters Towers, the latter town a great gold-mining centre, having a population of over 10,000 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the head of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook and Carpentaria Division a railway is being constructed to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 67 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also in course of construction from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Herberton, the great tin-mining centre, which is now open for traffic to Mareeba, a distance 46 miles. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, south-easterly.

There are 367 electric telegraph stations in the colony. The number of miles of line 10,090, with 18,472 miles of wire. The receipts were 77,739£.

The number of messages during 1897 was 1,165,184. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 1,127 subscribers who use it, and cables containing multiple wires are now being laid under ground to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks, with supplementary steamers occasionally; via Brindisi and Melbourne every week; via San Francisco and Sydney every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi and Torres Straits is forty-nine days. There is daily communication with Sydney and Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia. The rates of postage are:

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vic. No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1897 there were in operation 797 schools, with an enrolment of 95,028 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 173 private schools, with 12,372 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 848 pupils, on the roll in Dec., 1897. A University is about to be established. There are no local rates for education, which is paid for by the whole colony.

Defence.

The defence force of Queensland is organized under the Defence Act of 1884, including amendments of 1891, and consists of mounted infantry, field and garrison artillery, engineers, infantry, and rifle clubs. Under the Act all male inhabitants of Queensland, between the ages of eighteen and sixty years, and who are British subjects, and are not specially exempted, are, in case of war or invasion, or imminent danger of either, liable to be called on for service in the force, the necessary number of men being obtained by ballot. Persons who have been selected by ballot to serve may secure exemption by providing a suitable substitute. The period of service is three years and, in time of peace, corps are recruited by voluntary enlistment only. All members of the force are subject to the provisions of the Army Act when in uniform.

Pay.

A gunner of the permanent force is paid at the rate of 2s. 3d. per diem, in addition to free rations of bread, meat, and groceries; free kit on joining, uniform, barrack accommodation, fuel and light, and medical attendance. Special rates of working pay are given, as also 5l. bonus, on re-engagement for 3 years. Married men, to the extent of 5 per cent. of the establishment, draw lodging allowance at the rate of 1s. per diem. Good-conduct-badges, with pay at the rate of twopence per day for each badge, awarded to non-commissioned officers under the rank of sergeant, and to men under the following conditions:

Qualifying length of service—

- After 8 years' service ... 1 badge.
- " 6 " " " " " " 2 badges.
- " 9 " " " " " " 3 "

The rate of pay of the militia is under process of revision. Each member of a mounted corps draws horse allowance at the rate of 3l. per annum;
also 5s. per annum in lieu of bridle; and 10s. per annum in lieu of saddle. The man provides both horse and horse furniture.

A return showing the establishment and effective strength of the Queensland land forces on the 30th June, 1898, is as follows—

* Clubs.

The police are liable for service in case of emergency.

The force is commanded by an officer, who is styled the "Commandant of the Queensland Defence Force." Every officer, except officers of the regular army, receives, in the first instance, a provisional appointment, and obtains a commission as lieutenant, after passing an examination conducted by a Board of Examiners appointed by the Governor for the purpose.

Training.

Classes of instruction for officers and non-commissioned officers are formed twice during the year for periods of one month for each course. Special classes are also formed in addition as required. Recruits for the several arms join special squads which are formed as required in the different centres. Instruction is afforded by instructors of the permanent staff, and when the squad has performed forty drills, including a course of musketry, it is inspected by a staff officer, and those recruits who pass inspection are allowed to join the ranks of trained men in the corps in which they enrolled. All corps are inspected annually by the Commandant. Staff officers of the respective arms visit outlying districts periodically, attend parades and drills of corps, and afford instruction and give lectures on special subjects. The force is called out annually for continuous training for a period not exceeding eight days. Officers provide their own arms, accoutrements, and uniforms.

Immigration.

The arrivals from the United Kingdom for the year 1897 were 756. The arrivals from Hong Kong and China numbered 529, and of Polynesians from the South Sea Islands, 947.

By Act 53 Vic., No. 2, the number of Chinese to be landed by any one ship is limited to the proportion of one to every five hundred tons of the tonnage of such ship.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vic., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. Every man of 21 years, who has resided six months in some electorate or electorates is entitled to be registered as an elector. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government or a household in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 39 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act No. 10 of 1887, as amended by the Electoral Districts Act of 1892, the Colony is divided into 61 districts, of which 11 return two members, and 50 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.
