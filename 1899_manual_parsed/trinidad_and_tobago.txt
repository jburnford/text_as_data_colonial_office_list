TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.
The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 48 miles, and its average breadth 35 miles, and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony now includes Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 and 51 Vic., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of Oct., 1898, it was provided that, on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Gov. of Trinidad and Tobago the island of Tobago should be a ward of the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony, and that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled. The proclamation bringing these provisions into force has been issued.

History.
Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the king of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalised his visit by burning the newly founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Romeo de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercrombie, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The estimated population of the colony at the end of 1897 was 254,578, and is chiefly composed of English, Germans, French, Spanish, and a large proportion of East Indians, estimated at 83,032. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

General Description.
The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguanas. The whole gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. The quantities exported in
1897 were: Sugar, 110,026,245 lbs.; and cocoa, 27,758,319 lbs. Tobacco of a superior quality is also grown. Molasses, rum, bitters, coconuts, and asphalt are also exported.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about a million sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the last 6 years, 1892 to 1897, was 37.7 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1897 was 79.1° Fahr., the maximum being 91.0° in May, and the minimum 67.6° in February, and the rainfall 77.68 inches.

The island is divided into eight counties as shown on the map.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population in 1891, 33,278), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1897, 232 vessels registered. Seven miles of tramway and 500 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1891, 6,570), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

Both these towns possess elective municipal councils and mayors. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1891, 3,653). The total municipal revenue of the three boroughs in 1897 was £26,869l., the expenditure £27,095l., and the debt, Boro' of San Fernando excepted, was £38,003l., on 31st December, 1897.

A pitch lake, 104 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of £10,000l., and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease is for 21 years from 1st January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of £4,000l. a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from the Pitch Lake in 1897 was £42,165l.

Of the total area of Trinidad which is estimated at about 1,120,000 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of 1897 was estimated to be approximately 442,924 acres. About 200,000 acres are under cultivation; 677,076 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers, which ply three times a week, and by the railway. The Gulf steamers proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles), on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Prince's Town in 1884, and further extensions to Sangre Grande (12 miles) and Tabaquito (15 miles) were opened to traffic on 29th August, 1897, and 18th August, 1898, respectively. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande. The total length of line open is about 96 miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total receipts from the railways, tramways and telegraphs during 1897 were £67,230l., and the expenditure was £63,344l. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund, which in 1897 amounted to £111,039l.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and about 57 offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada, and Saint Croix, and thence via the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 166 miles, constructed by the Government. The receipts in 1897 were £647l., and the expenses £1,492l.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 34 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides some few transient steamers:—Harrison Line, West Indian and Pacific, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Dutch Line, London Direct Line, Oriental, Canadian, Quebec and Gulf Line, Oriental and Ciudad Bolivar, Orinoco Line, New York and Bermudez, Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co.'s fruit subsidy steamers, and the Royal Mail Line. It worthy of note that the steamers of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique are as a rule of greater tonnage than the ocean boats of the Royal Mail, and find no difficulty in entering the port. The communication with the neighbouring Republic of Venezuela averages for the year over 16 steamers per month. A fortnightly service to New York has been started by a local firm. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers. The rates of postage are as follows per ¼-oz. letter:—

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £63,418l. was expended by the Government in 1897, in introducing 1,860 (Statute adults) immigrants. The numbers introduced in 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, and 1897 respectively were 3,750, 1,940, 2,519, 2,193, 3,087, and 1,860.

The amount remitted to India during 1897 by return Indian immigrants was .................. £7,091 0 0

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, United States gold currency, and gold doubloons. These are all legal tender, as is also British gold, which is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of 105,000l. estimated.

There is no Colonial coinage or note issue.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

* See list on p. 27. A new rate on parcels exchanged with the U.K. came into force on 1st Jan., 1899 (p. 27).
The Colonial Bank has a branch at Port of Spain. Government savings banks are established in nine districts. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1897 was £232,650. They are under the management of the Receiver-General and the local wardens.

**Defence.**

A volunteer rifle corps was established in Port of Spain in 1879, and detached companies at San Fernando, Arima, Princes Town, Couva, and Tunapuna. A yeomanry corps has also been established with troops in large centres, and a volunteer artillery corps at Port of Spain. Total strength 850.

The police force consists of 517 officers and men.

**Education.**

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, St. Mary's College. Attached to these institutions are four exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of £150 each, tenable for three years at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of 1897—95 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and 195 on those of St. Mary's College.

The primary schools are now 196 in number, 56 of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and 140 denominational and assisted. Fees are exacted, the rate being twopence per head per week, and at the Model Schools and two assisted schools five shillings per month.

In connection with the Model Schools there are Training Colleges for male and female teachers, which admit twelve resident and seven non-resident students. The Government schools in 1897 had 6,558 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 17,393.

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for girls. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad is shown to be 28,951.

**Government.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of seven members. The legislative body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 9 official, and 11 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.

### Tobago

#### History

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealander seamen sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a Company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillie, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1788 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1798, it was captured by a British Force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty.
of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

By Order in Council under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, Tobago became a Ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from a date fixed by Proclamation of the Governor, which was issued on the

Situation and Area.

It is the most southerly of the Windward group of the British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9', W. leng. 60° 12', distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,813 acres, of which about 10,000 acres are under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

General Description.

Sugar, rum, molasses, cocoanuts, and live stock form the principal articles of export. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population in 1891 of 919. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacolet Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who maintain 27 schools with about 2,000 scholars, assisted by a Government grant of £50l.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the united Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a Ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a Proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created. Various other changes have been made in the direction of reducing the establishments, and further reductions will be made when the claims of existing officers permit.
