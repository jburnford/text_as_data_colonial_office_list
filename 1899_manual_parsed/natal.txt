NATAL.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north and north-west by the Portuguese possessions, and the South African Republic, on the west by the Orange Free State and Basutoland, and on the south by the Cape Colony and Umtamvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,089 square miles, and has a seaboard of 376 miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 370 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of 24,595; the largest town and only port is Durban, with 39,245 inhabitants, of whom 11,000 are natives and 10,500 Indians.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 29th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Amatongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1685, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonize it. Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Chaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with various success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

Constitution.

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act, of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first ministry was appointed.

The ministers are—

The Colonial Secretary, who is also Prime Minister.
The Attorney-General, who is also Minister of Education.
The Minister of Lands and Works.
The Minister of Agriculture.
The Secretary for Native Affairs.
The Treasurer.

All of whom must hold seats in either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, but not more than two may be members of the Legislative Council.

In place of the Legislative Council as previously existing, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly are constituted.

The Legislative Council, consisting of twelve Members, is summoned by the Governor in Council. The Members are summoned from the
connected. Langalibalele and his son were trans- 5,000 are Dutch, the rest being chiefly Brit
following districts of the Colony:—Five from within the counties of Durban, Victoria, Alexandra, and Alfred; three from within the counties of Pietermaritzburg and Umtati, three from within the counties of Weenen and Klip River; and one from the Province of Zululand; but not more than two Members may be chosen from within any one county.

Each Member holds his seat for ten years from the date of his summons, but five of the Members first summoned vacate their seats at the end of five years.

No person may be summoned as a Member of the Legislative Council unless he be the registered proprietor of immovable property within the Colony of the value of £500 in net value.

The Legislative Assembly is an elective body, and consists of 39 Members who must be duly qualified and registered electors chosen by the electors of the several electoral districts, of which there are 15 in the Colony.

The duration of the Legislative Assembly is limited to four years from the date of the return of the writs of election, but the Governor may dissolve the Assembly whenever he may think fit.

The laws relating to the mode of election, the qualifications of electors, and to all other matters concerning elections, in force at the time of the passing of the Act, apply to the election of Members to serve in the Legislative Assembly. Under the Act No. 10 of 1898, provision is made for the Parliamentary representation of the Province of Zululand.

The reserved Civil List attached to the Act includes £2,900 for pensions to officers retired on account of the change in the Constitution, and also £8,200 for the salaries of the Governor and Ministers, £600 for an Under Secretary for Native Affairs, and £10,000 for the promotion of the welfare and education of the natives.

Members are not paid, but those residing more than two miles from the Seat of Government receive 1l. per day travelling allowance. The session is usually from April to June.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or is in receipt of rents from property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month, is entitled to a vote.

Local Government.

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, and Newcastle, and local boards in Ladysmith, Verulam, Greytown, and Dundee. Their total revenue in 1897 was 234,483l., their expenditure, 245,156l., and their debt 761,671l.

Native Affairs.

In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amalubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his son were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crimes mala in se. The native population was debarred from the franchise, but by an Act No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law, in which case he was entitled to all the rights of an ordinary colonist.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the Chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895 the Native High Court and the Court established by law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these Courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. A white magistrate was formerly placed with every tribe, who was the administrator of justice in civil matters, and superseded to a considerable extent the authority of the chiefs. The tribes live apart, upon locations provided for them by the Government. But besides these location natives there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms. By law No. 13 of 1875 a tax of 5l. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under law 41, 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut is imposed upon natives living on Crown lands.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is 2,200,000 acres, besides about 150,000 acres held by religious missions. The number of natives living on these lands was estimated in 1885 at 169,800, there being at the same date about 162,600 on private lands as tenants, and 42,000 on Crown lands as squatters. With the exception of the District of Proviso B, which is occupied by Boer farmers, and the townships of Nondivoni and Eshowe, all the lands in the Province of Zululand are vested in the Crown. There are about 195,000 natives residing thereon.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies, but is usually mild, cool, and bright. On the coast it is semi-tropical. The mean temperature at Pietermaritzburg is 65°, and at Durban 69°. The rainfall at the coast is about 40 inches, and less inland. The rainy season is from October to March inclusive, during which thunderstorms are frequent and severe. There is no malaria in the colony. The death rates at Pietermaritzburg and Durban are 15 and 17 per thousand respectively.

About 87 per cent. of the inhabitants are Zulu natives, and about 6½ per cent. are Indian Coolies. The Europeans number some 50,000, of whom about 5,000 are Dutch, the rest being chiefly British.
Means of Communication.

There is a weekly mail service with England (22 days), with the Cape daily, with Mauritius and East Coast ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, &c.) once or twice a month, with Delagoa Bay six times a month or more frequently, with Australia fortnightly, and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. Steamers pass between Natal and Table Bay every week, calling at East London, Port Elizabeth, and Mossel Bay. There are also two direct lines of steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is about 24 days. Two mail and passenger trains leave daily for Cape Town via Johannesburg, the distance being accomplished in 72 hours.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the South African Republic, the Orange Free State, the Cape, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the world generally.

The rates of postage are:

| Letters, ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|---------------|------------|
| Internal and Cape | 1d. | ½d. per 4 oz. |
| Orange Free State, and Transvaal | 1d. | ½d. |
| U.K., India, and certain British Colonies* | 1d. | ½d. per 2 oz. |
| Most other countries | 2½d. | ½d. |

There are 801½ miles of Government telegraphs constructed at a cost of £97,113, and the earnings for the year ended 1897 were £35,948. 7s. 9d. (cash receipts, £25,402. 15s. 3d., and value of Government messages, £10,543. 12s. 6d.), and the expenses, £19,969. 13s. 2d.

There are 475½ miles of railway open, all constructed and worked by the Government, with the exception of the North Coast Extension beyond Verulam (20½ miles), which was constructed by the Natal-Zululand Railway Company, and is worked by the Government on behalf of that Company in accordance with a working agreement.

The main line extends from the Port of Durban to Pietermaritzburg (the capital of the colony, 70 miles inland), and from thence to Charlestown, on the border of the South African Republic (309 miles distant from the port), where it connects with the Netherlands South African Company's line to Johannesburg and Pretoria. A branch line extends northwards from Durban to Umhlali River (40 miles), the temporary terminus of the extension now in course of construction by the Natal-Zululand Railway Company to the Tugela River at the border of the Province of Zululand.

Another branch runs from South Coast Junction to Park Rynie (36 miles), and Parliament has authorised an extension of that branch to Port Shepstone (about 36 miles), which will place in touch with the town of Durban a portion of the colony which has large natural resources. This District contains valuable marble deposits.

The work of railway construction was begun in January, 1876, and the sections then authorised were completed in November, 1880. Two subsequent extensions of 119 and 114 miles respectively were sanctioned, and the last, which completes the main line to Charlestown, on the border of the South African Republic, was opened for passenger traffic on 7th April, 1891, and for goods traffic on 1st August, 1891. Connection with Johannesburg and Pretoria was opened at the close of 1893. A branch to Harrismith, in the Orange Free State, from the main line at the 190½ mile post, was opened for traffic on 14th July, 1892, with a mileage of 59¼ miles, 2¾ of which run through the Orange Free State.

An extension to Bethlehem, in the Orange Free State, is being carried out by the Government of that Republic.

Among the extensions now proceeding is one from Pietermaritzburg to Greytown (64½ miles). Another extension from Coal Fields, the terminus of the Dundee Branch Line to the Buffalo River, will be proceeded with immediately, and form the Natal section of the line between Vryheid, in the South African Republic, and the Colony.

The total cost of construction of the railways up to the end of 1897, was £6,588,507. The receipts for 1897 were £1,051,359., and the expenditure £583,088. The net receipts were equal to 7l. 2s. 1½d. per cent. upon the capital expended upon open lines.

Defence.

There is an Imperial garrison of 5,000 men quartered at Pietermaritzburg, Ladysmith and Eshowe, consisting of two regiments of cavalry, four batteries of artillery and three infantry battalions, besides detachments of mounted infantry and departmental corps.

The Volunteer Force of the Colony is partially paid, and consists of 1,584 of all ranks—all Europeans—divided into a naval corps of 90 men, between 800 and 900 Mounted Riflemen, a field battery and an infantry battalion. The whole force is fully equipped and armed with modern weapons.

The colony also maintains an armed and mounted police force numbering 350 Europeans fully equipped and available for field service.

Military training is compulsory on all boys over 10 years attending the Government schools. They are organised in cadet corps and number over 2,000.

The Port of Durban is defended by batteries armed with modern heavy guns.

Industry.

The chief exports are wool, sugar, tea, hides, gold, coal, maize, hair, wattle bark, and ostrich feathers.

There is a large transit trade with the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The harbour of Durban, which has a bar at its entrance, has been much improved by the works of the Harbour Department, and by dredging. There is ordinarily a depth of from 19 to 20 feet on the bar at low water. It is a port of registry having in 1897 29 vessels, with a total tonnage of 6,951 tons. The main industry of the colony is, however, agriculture, large numbers of cattle and sheep being reared, and large crops of maize and sugar raised. The land under cultivation amounts to 734,000 acres. There are several mines of coal, those at Dundee, Eldan's Laagte, and Newcastle supplying the Government railways. The present output is from 400,000 to 520,000 tons per annum. The cost of coal at the pit's mouth is under 9s. a ton, and the freight charged for railway transport is ½d. a ton per mile.

The area under sugar is about 18,945 acres, the produce for the year 1897 being about 18,250 tons; that under coffee about 322 acres, yielding about 36,000 lbs. Tea, tobacco, arrowroot, and
cayenne pepper are also grown. The area under
tom in 1897 was 2,665 acres, yielding 848,930 lbs.,
and the area cultivated by natives was 598,790
acres.

Excluding the Province of Zululand, the stock
owned by Europeans was as follows: Horses,
26,921; mules, 3,790; cattle (horned) 125,992;
sheep, 657,490; Angora goats, 54,795; pigs,
12,854; donkeys, 1,270. The stock owned by
natives was as follows: Horses, 21,760; cattle
(horned), 114,829; sheep, 65,297; goats, 252,183;
pigs, 27,312.

The very large decrease in the number of horned
cattle is due to the ravages of rinderpest during
the latter half of 1897. The disease has now
been stamped out.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling.
The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South
Africa, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking
Corporation, and the National Bank of the South
African Republic have together fifteen establish-
ments, with 2,287,245L deposits. A Government
savings bank was established in 1868, and had in
1897 (Dec. 31st), 263,837L deposits.

Education.

In 1897 there were 508 schools under Govern-
ment inspection—319 European, 159 native, and
30 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of
19,222. There are 23 Government schools, 67 aided
denominational and other schools, and 252 farm-
house schools. The aggregate number of European
pupils in regular attendance at the Government and
inspected schools was 7,585 (1897). The manage-
ment is vested in the Minister of Education, with
the Superintendent of Education as permanent
head of the Department, and the local control
occasionally in committees. Education is not com-
pulsory. There are government secondary schools
at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private
establishments.

THE PROVINCE OF ZULULAND.

Situation and Area.

Zululand now a province of Natal, is bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean, on the north-west by that portion of the South African Republic (Vrijheid District) formerly known as the "New Republic," and Swaziland, and on the north by Portuguese Tongaland. It comprises the territory formerly known as the Zulu Reserve, with about two-thirds of the territory restored to Cetywayo and British territory in Usibebu in 1883, and was formally declared May, 1887, and the territories of the native chiefs Sambana and Umbeza, which were annexed to Zululand in 1895, thus extending the boundary of the territory to the Pongolo River and Swaziland. (The estimated area is roughly about 13,168 square miles.)

History.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Chaka pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well organised kingdom. Chaka was murdered and succeeded by Dingaan in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Panda. In the latter years of Panda Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Panda's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetywayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetywayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, claimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetywayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two powers took place. Cetywayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetywayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being however by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetywayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose force advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandlwana, the other at Inyezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night, the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hloblane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginhlvo on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.
The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetywayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetywayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Chaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent Chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetywayo Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatusi River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatusi and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetywayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was re-installed by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutus, finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And a reward for this service the Boers receive a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinuzulu, a son of Cetywayo, as king; but it was soon checked, and Dinuzulu and some of his indunas were removed to St. Helena, while others were imprisoned or fined.

On the 18th Dec., 1884, the British flag had been hoisted at St Lucia Bay, which was ceded to the English Government by Panda in 1843. A proclamation of December, 1888, made it clear that Sordwana Point and Bay were included in Zululand. A further notification (in February, 1890), declared the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manabe, to form part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Umbegiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Amatongaland, also called Amaputaland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the North by Portuguese Possessions, on the West and South by Zululand, and on the East by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongola with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and is now (1897) being laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments. The population is estimated at 9,000. The Amatonga are an independent tribe which has been ruled for years by a Paramount Chief under a form of vassalage to the Zulu kings. Owing, probably, to the unhealthiness of the country, the Amatonga do not possess the fine physique of the Zulu race. By a Proclamation issued on the 17th September, 1896, by the Governor of Zululand as Special Commissioner for Amatongaland, under an Order in Council dated the 29th June, 1896, provision was made for the administration of Amatongaland. The Laws of Zululand therein declared to be in force within the Protectorate, so far as applicable and as circumstances may admit, have been administered by a Deputy Commissioner invested with the same powers and jurisdiction as are exercised by Magistrates in Zululand. By Proclamation of the 22nd of November, 1897, the Protectorate of Amatongaland was declared to be part of the Queen's dominions, and was annexed on the 27th of December to Zululand, which was itself annexed to Natal on the 30th of December. Postal communication is maintained between Zululand and Amatongaland via the Ubombo Magistracy twice a week by native mail-carriers. Supplies are drawn either from Delagoa Bay, up the Maputa river by barge and thence by wagon, or by the main road overland from Eshowe, the seat of Government in Zululand.

Law and Constitution.

The "Zulu Native Reserve" was administered from 1883 to May, 1887, by a Resident Commissioner, immediately responsible to H.M.'s Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs; and order was maintained by a force of mounted native police. This organisation was subsequently extended over the whole territory.

The Territory was till the end of 1896 administered through a Resident Commissioner residing at Eshowe, under the direct supervision of the Governor of Natal (also Governor of Zululand), who exercised the power of legislating by proclamation. Zululand is divided into 12 magisterial districts, viz., Eshowe, including the Umlalazi division), Nkandhl, Nqutu, Entonjaneni, Lower Umfolosi, Ndwandwe, Ubombo, Hlabisa, and IngwaYuma. Native law remains in force as between natives, and the tribal authority of the chiefs is not interfered with. Natal law has been proclaimed as having force, as far as applicable, in Zululand, except in certain circum-
stances for which special laws and regulations are provided. The occupation of land by Europeans is not allowed, except for missionary, trading, or mining purposes. A hut tax of fourteen shillings per annum is levied throughout Zululand. In November 1897, a bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 29th Dec. incorporating Zululand with Natal. Amatongaland had been previously proclaimed to be part of H.M.'s Dominions, and annexed to Zululand.

The seat of government is at Eshowe, where a township has been established. Another township, Melmoth, has been surveyed and laid off on private property in Entonjaneni district.

The township of Nondwani has been laid off in the Nqutu district, where mining and prospecting for gold is carried on.

Trade and Industry.

The pursuits of the Zulus are mainly agricultural, crops of maize (mealies), and other cereals being raised round their kraals. Their individual wealth consists in cattle, of which they possess considerable numbers. They avoid the sea, and have no fishing. Trade is carried on by a few trading settlers, and by traders' waggons from Natal, which traverse the country periodically. Oxen and maize are exchanged for cotton goods and hardware. Gold has been found in the Nqutu, Nkandhla, and Entonjaneni districts, and several companies are being floated to work the properties taken up. The quantity of gold produced in 1896 was 1,503 ozs., equal in value to about 5,023l.10s.0d. The principal diggings are at Nondwani, in the Nqutu district, the results of which have not so far been encouraging. The territory is rich in minerals, such as coal, iron, copper, lead, &c.; 19 provisional applications for mineral leases, representing 39,500 acres, were registered during 1897. The importation of spirituous liquors is prohibited, except under special permit, and the supply of spirits to natives, whether by sale or otherwise, is strictly forbidden.

Good wagon roads have been constructed to the magistracies in the different districts. Main roads from Natal cross the border at Rorke's Drift, and at the lower drifts of the Tugela river; and from Zululand they cross into the South African Republic at the following points:—Nkandi, Isipezi, Entonjaneni and Idhlubi Hills, and near the source of the Mkusana river.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. There is as yet no Government savings bank. The Natal bank has opened a branch at Eshowe.

Means of Communication.

The absence of any good landing place prevents communication by sea. St. Lucia Bay, Sordwana Bay, and Port Durnford are nothing but exposed and surf-bound beaches, affording no harbour. Eshowe is in communication with Natal by telegraph, 30 miles, and by tri-weekly post-cart. A telegraph line from Eshowe to Melmoth and a line from Vant's Drift on the Natal border to the Nondwani gold fields and Nqutu magistracy have been opened. A telephone line from Melmoth, connecting with the Ndwandwe magistracy, to the Ubonbo magistracy has recently been completed over a distance of 94 miles. The parcels post is in operation to Eshowe. Post offices exist in the different districts, all in connection with Eshowe, the mails being conveyed regularly by native mail carriers. In the territory, and to Natal (Zululand, with Natal, joined the Universal Postal Union in 1892), postage rates are 1d. per half-ounce; to the Cape and Free State, 1d. per half-ounce; Transvaal, 2d.; the United Kingdom, 2½d. Postal money order offices are established at Eshowe, Melmoth, Nondwani, Nqutu, and Nkandhla. The revenue for post and telegraph for 1896 was 1,851l.12s.1d., and the expenditure 2,779l.5s.5d. The figures for 1897 are included in those of Natal.

Education.

The Government contributes grant-in-aid to a certain portion of the native schools, and it supports three European schools at Nondwani, Eshowe and Melmoth. The total number of children on school rolls is about 47 European and 1,327 natives. The Government has placed 1,250l. on the Estimates for 1898-9, in aid of Education in the Province of Zululand, and the schools of Zululand are now under the control of the Education Department, Natal.

Population.—Estimated in 1896 about 1,101 Europeans, 179,271 natives; the population of Zululand is included in Natal estimate for 1897.
