WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

Physical Features.

The coast line, extending for a distance of about 5,200 miles, is indented by a certain number of bays, creeks, and harbours, and in the northern parts fringed by numerous islands. In the south there are three separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The loftiest range in the Southern District is the Stirling Range, the highest point of which is about 3,500 feet. The principal other ranges are known as the Blackwood, Darling, and Roe; these, with the exception of Mount William, in the Murray District, 3,000 feet high, do not reach greater altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea. In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the Leopold and the Mueller ranges, the highest point in the latter attaining about 2,500 feet. The settled districts are usually level or undulating, rarely mountainous. The western seaboard is comparatively flat, of a sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation. To the eastward of the Darling range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character, and improves for some distance inland. The north and north-eastern parts of the Colony contain a large area of good pastoral country, suitable also in some parts for the growth of tropical products, such as sugar and coffee.

The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the north, to Point d'Entrecasteaux in the south, a distance of about 300 miles.

Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this range, and flow into the sea to the westward.

The principal rivers of the Colony are the Ord, Prince Regent, Panton, Fitzroy, De Grey, Harding,
Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoyne, Murchison, Greenough, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Collie, Preston, Blackwood, Warren, Pallinup, and Gordon. Most of these are more storm-water channels filled only during the rainy season, and very few of them are navigable for any distance even for small boats.

Lakes and Islands.

The lake district may be considered to be confined to the westward of the Darling range; within this area there are numerous salt and fresh water lakes and lagoons—but many of them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.

Numerous islands and islets occur along the coast-line. Dirk Hartog Island, in Sharks Bay, is the largest of those used for pastoral purposes, whilst guano is found on the islands comprised in Houtman's Abrolhos, the Lacepedes, and various other islands on the north-west coast.

History.

In 1825 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1827 Captain James Stirling, in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and in 1829 Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. "Challenger," took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle (the latter named after Captain Fremantle mentioned above), and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1830, the Colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned that it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution was what is called "Representative," established by Act 83 Victoria, No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The legislature consists of two houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 24 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 44 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The Colony is divided into 8 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the Colony for at least 2 years; (3) a natural born subject of Her Majesty or naturalized for 5 years, and a resident in the Colony during that period.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the Colony for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the Queen, or shall have been naturalized for 5 years, and shall have resided in the Colony for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Any man of the age of 21 years being a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and not subject to any legal incapacity, who shall have resided in the colony for at least 12 months, if he (1) has been resident in the district at the time of making his claim for 6 months; or (2) has held a freehold estate in the district of the clear value of 50l. above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same for 6 months next before the time of making the claim; or (3) has been a householder for the last preceding 6 months, the house or premises being of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (4) is the holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l., the lease of which has 18 months to run; or (5) has been holder for the last preceding 18 months of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (6) has been the holder for the last preceding 6 months of a lease or license of Crown lands at an annual rental of 5l.; or (7) has his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Board in respect of property within the district.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Colonial Treasurer, the Director of Public Works (also Commissioner of Railways), the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Minister of Mines, the Attorney-General, and the Colonial Secretary.

Local Government.

Under Act 59 Vict., No. 10, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have
been proclaimed: Albany, Beverley, Bunbury, Boulder, Bulong, Broad Arrow, Russelton, Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Cossack, Cue, Day Dawn, Esperance, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Gingin, Guildford, Helena Vale, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Lederville, Mt. Magnet, Menzies, Nannine, Newcastle, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, Perth, Roebourne, Subiaco, Southern Cross, Victoria Park, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000, consist of a chairman and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and for each ward three councillors—the mayor or chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. Under "The Water Works Act, 1889" (53 Vic. 18) the Perth City Council is authorized to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £; also under "The Public Health Act, 1886," Councils of Municipalities, to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 3d. in the £; 50,000l. was granted in 1897 to district roads boards (of which there were, at the end of 1897, 74) and municipal councils (35) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the colony.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the colony at the 31st December, 1897, was estimated to be 161,924, consisting of 110,359 males, and 51,565 females, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese was 1,957, of whom 1,916 were males and only 21 females. In June, 1898, the estimated population was 171,021.

The chief towns are Perth, 37,929 (Census of Water Supply Department), Fremantle (17,000), Coolgardie (11,000), Kalgoorlie (20,000), Albany (3,000), Bunbury (1,500), Cue (1,050), Esperance (1,000), Geraldton (2,500), Guildford (1,200), Kanowna (2,500), Menzies (2,000), Norseman (1,200), Northam (2,200), York (2,000).

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the colony 8,847,044 acres only have been alienated or are in process of alienation, while 87,244,929 acres are leased for pastoral, and 877,889 for other purposes. No less than 527,590,768 acres are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 5,200 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. In the southwest corner of the colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total area of arable land on 28th Feb., 1898, was 270,525 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,210,742) are depastured in all parts of the colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1897, principally to London, was 12,374,881 lbs. which, at 5½d. per lb. for greasy and 9½d. per lb. for scoured, is valued at 295,646l. A considerable quantity of wine is also made. In 1897, 138,182 acres were under crop.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1897 was valued at 192,451l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore, China, and other places to the value of about 49,480l. during 1897.

At Shark Bay and on the north-west coast a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounted to 60,234l. in 1897.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but for the last few years little work has been done in them, owing to the fall in the value of these metals. The prospects in copper are, however, improving.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

Since the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining has become the principal industry of the Colony, and so rapidly has the annual output of gold increased of late, that it promises at no distant date, to place Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing Colonies of Australasia.

There are now 17 goldfields in existence—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Gascoyne, Murchison, East Murchison, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, and a large population is continually employed in searching for and extracting precious metals.

Much machinery is in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a great future before them, judging from the steady increase both in returns and population. The value of gold exported up to the end of April, 1898, was 7,407,025l. In the first four months of 1898
the value of the gold export was £1,165,059l., against £580,904l. in the corresponding period of 1897.

There is also evidence of the existence of good coal both in the south-west corner of the Colony and in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood River, and the total export of this mineral to the end of 1897 is estimated at £78,467l. There is little doubt that a fairly rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in very small quantities.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Australasia.

The deposits in the banks during the year ended 31st December, 1897, averaged £4,069,667l., and the advances by the banks, £3,349,806l.

A Government Post Office savings bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1896, amounted to £520,016l., during the year ended 30th June, 1897, to £1,068,322l., and during the year ended 30th June, 1898, to £1,231,638l.

A branch of the Royal Mint has been erected in Perth.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are under the supervision of the Minister of Education, assisted by elected district boards. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (58 Vict., No. 30), and are enforced.

By the "Assisted Schools Abolition Act, 1895" (59 Vic., No. 27), the grants to private schools were discontinued, but a compensation was made to the schools that had so far received subsidy, the sum of £15,000l. being divided amongst them in proportion to the grants received by them during 1895.

The amount expended on education for 1897 was £57,480l., on school buildings £53,014l. A high school is also subsidised by the State.

In the year 1897 there were 167 Government schools in the colony, with 12,262 scholars on the rolls, and private schools, with scholars.

Means of Communication.

The colony possesses at present (August, 1898) four lines of Government railways: The Eastern Railway (468 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, Guildford, Northam, Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, and Kanowna, including branch lines from Clackline Junction to Newcastle (14 miles), from Spencer's Brook Junction to York and Beverley (38 miles), and one mile to the Perth racecourse.

There is also a branch line (7 miles) running out from Kalgoorlie to the Boulder; the Northern Railway, with a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district, one from Geraldton to Walkaway (18 miles), and one from Geraldton to Cue (253 miles); the South-Western Railway, from Perth to Bunbury (165 miles), including a line from Picton Junction to Vasse (38 miles), and a line from Boyanup Junction to Donnybrook (10 miles); there is also a line (26 miles) from Brunswick Junction to Collie Coalfields, and the Great Southern from Beverley to Albany (243 miles), in all, 1,214 miles of railway open for traffic.

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Midland Junction and Walkaway, and connects the two Government railways.

There are also several lines constructed by private timber companies in the south of the colony, in extent about 187 miles. The following lines are now under construction by Government:

— Bridgetown (42 miles), Menzies (80 miles), Greenhills (13 miles), and Owen's Anchorage (3 miles). The receipts of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1898, were £1,022,425l., and the working expenses £788,941l. The total cost of construction has been £5,047,28l.

Of electric telegraph at the end of 1897 there were 8,236½ miles of wire, and 965 more miles in course of erection. The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1897 was 1,306,023, and the revenue received £99,861l. (worked by Post Office Department); cost of Post and Telegraph, £28,724l.

There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and also by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 1,527 miles of private telephone wire in the colony, and 4,732 miles of railway telephone wire.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient Messageries Maritimes, and Nord-Deutsche Lloyd Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, and the other Australasian colonies. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australasian colonies by various intercolonial steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 30 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

Postcards

Frome is a port of registry, with 152 vessels and a tonnage of 9,010 on 31st December, 1897. Harbour works there are progressing satisfactorily.

Defence.

In December, 1897, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 715 of all ranks. Of this number 226 belong to the Artillery, and the r

mainder principally to the various rifle corps.

King George's Sound, on the south coast, is being strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office.

Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. The natives were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they used to be largely utilised as pearl-shell divers, whilst their industry was confined to moderately shallow waters. As a general rule they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned the successful mission conducted at New Norcia (by the Right Reverend Bishop Salvado), which was commenced in the year 1846. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia was passed by the houses of legislature in 1897. In accordance with its clauses, the welfare of the natives is now entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a Minister of the Crown, and provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of £5,000 to be used by this sub-department.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The mean average death-rate is 16 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33.285 inches (for 21 years), and the mean temperature is 64°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders'
Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between British subjects living in these islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, or New South Wales, and not being within the jurisdiction of any civilised power; and includes the Southern Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, the Tongan or Friendly Islands, the Samoan or Navigators' Islands, and the various small groups of Melanesia. In 1893 a new Order-in-Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order-in-Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's Jurisdiction is extended to foreigners, and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. The expenses of the High Commission are met from Imperial funds, Class V., vote 8, the amount provided in the estimates for 1897-98 being £2,190.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner, and where the attendance of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court is impracticable, the High Commissioner may appoint a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of Her Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all her Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases occurring where there is no resident Deputy Commissioner, certain officers in command of her Majesty's ships of war on the Australian station have been appointed Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

PRINCIPAL GROUPS UNDER THE HIGH COMMISSIONER.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, are situated between the 15th and 23rd degrees of west longitude. The islands are most of them of coral formation, but include some active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafoou (Good Hope Island); The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra (the dried kernel of the nut) forms the principal export. Bananas and oranges are also exported from Vavau, in the northern part of the group. There is regular steam communication with Auckland (1,000 miles distant), Sydney (1,850 miles), and Fiji, and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles). Sailing vessels carry the copra to Europe.

The late king, George Tubon, was the first of its chiefs or kings to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, and his rule on the whole was fairly successful. The king is assisted by a native parliament and a privy council. With the exception of a few Europeans in the Customs, Education, and Medical Departments, the whole of the government offices are Tongans. The tariff resembles that of Fiji and licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades. The revenue and expenditure are each about 16,000l. per annum. According to the official returns the imports and exports were:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1888 | £48,376 | £66,888 |
| 1889 | £45,240 | £80,306 |
| 1890 | £28,822 | £45,325 |
| 1891 | £51,929 | £75,400 |
| 1892 | £51,266 | £53,957 |
| 1893 | £64,692 | £79,223 |
| 1894 | £82,330 | £67,632 |
| 1895 | £87,240 | £113,240 |
| 1896 | £90,915 | £91,602 |
| 1897 | £74,561 | £64,391 |

*But the value of the copra exported is about 20 per cent. too high. The native population is about 19,196; the Europeans about 353. The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.*
There are three Churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years), with at present about 3,000 adherents only; the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; and the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents. The Free Church was established in 1885, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakagoo" i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Waldemar Baker, the Premier, an ex-Wesleyan Missionary. Six persons charged with complicity in the attempt were shot. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakagoo," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church, whose houses were pillaged, and who were beaten with clubs and whips till they declared their adhesion to the "Free Church." About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren inhospitable islet south of Tonga; but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakagoo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he, in accordance with the power conferred on the High Commissioner by the Western Pacific Orders in Council, issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make the necessary arrangements for their return.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufaahau, under the title of George Tubou II. The present Premier is Josateki Toga.

All the natives are taught to read and write, and higher education is provided by colleges established by the Government and by the Wesleyan Mission.

British subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine and local police, not recognized as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

The Samoan or Navigator Islands are situated between the 13th and 15th parallels of south latitude, and the 169th and 174th degrees of west longitude. The inhabitants, about 25,000 in number, belong to the Polynesian race. The islands, which are of volcanic origin, are very fertile. The principal export is copra, but cotton, coffee, and bananas are also exported. A considerable portion of the land has been alienated, part of which is cultivated by British and German residents. The Hamburg Commercial and Planting Company of the South Seas has extensive plantations, and also has at Samoa its principal depot for South Sea trade.

No effective Government had been established before 1889. The late King Malietoa was recognised as king in 1879, and Tamasese, his principal opponent, was given the title of Vice-King. In 1884, Tamasese formed a party to depose Malietoa and place himself on the throne. The German Government, which was displeased with Malietoa for refusing to ratify a treaty giving Germany a preponderating influence in the affairs of Samoa, favoured the pretensions of Tamasese. In 1886 a commission was appointed consisting of commissioners from Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, with a view to arrive at an agreement respecting Samoan affairs. After the commissioners had reported to their respective Governments, a conference was held at Washington, but no agreement was arrived at. In 1887 Tamasese, with the assistance of the German forces, obtained possession of the seat of Government; and Malietoa, having surrendered himself to the German Consul-General, was deported in a German man-of-war to West Africa, whence he was afterwards removed to the Marshall group. An attempt was then made to organise an efficient government throughout Samoa under Tamasese, Herr Brandeis being made Premier. But after a little while the adherents of Malietoa, under the leadership of his relative Mataafa, took arms against Tamasese and occupied a position close to Apia, the seat of Government. In December, 1888, at the instance of the German Consul, an ineffectual attempt was made to dislodge Mataafa by an armed party from German men-of-war. The German Government having disapproved the action of their Consul, proposed that a fresh conference should be held. A conference was accordingly held at Berlin, and a convention arrived at between Germany, Great Britain, and the United States with regard to the future government of Samoa. In accordance with this convention, Malietoa was reinstated as king, and a Supreme Court of Samoa was constituted, with a Chief Justice appointed by the three Powers. The Chief Justice is also the king's principal legislative adviser. Further disturbances took place in 1893, and the three powers were compelled to intervene, and Mataafa and some of his followers were removed from the Group to the Marshall Islands.

In the summer of 1898, the consent of the Treaty powers was obtained to the return of Mataafa and his followers, under a pledge of loyal obedience to the existing government. On the 23rd August, 1898, King Malietoa died somewhat suddenly, and the Consuls of the Treaty Powers have assumed the direction of affairs pending the election of his successor (December, 1898).

The township of Apia is managed by a municipal council consisting of six members elected by the ratepayers, and of a president appointed by the three Treaty Powers. Bye-laws for the payment of rates, prevention of diseases, and the preservation of good order are enforced by a municipal
magistrate, whose decisions are open to review by the Chief Justice.

British subjects are under the jurisdiction of the high commissioner's court in respect of all criminal offences not cognisable by the municipal magistrate, and in all civil cases (other than suits relating to realty) where both parties are British subjects. The supreme court exercises jurisdiction in all suits relating to real property, or where the parties are of different nationalities, and also exercises complete jurisdiction over the nationals of all countries which have not established their own courts in Samoa.

The London Missionary Society, the Wesleyan Mission of Australasia, and the Roman Catholic Society of Mary have all established churches in Samoa, the adherents of the first named being the most numerous. English and German schools are established in Apia.

Apia, the principal town, has about 350 European inhabitants. The climate is not good, and the heat is frequently oppressive. But plantations situated a few hundred feet above the sea are not unhealthy.

There is regular steam communication with Auckland (distant 1,600 miles) Sydney (2,450 miles), and Fiji (450 miles).

The Union Group consists of three small islands, Fakaofo, Oatafu, and Nukumono, about 9° S. latitude and 172° W. longitude. The islands are coral atolls, and the principal article of trade is copra. The natives are of Polynesian race, and are over 1,000 in number. They are ruled by their own chiefs with the assistance of native councils. A British Protectorate has been proclaimed over this group. The inhabitants are either adherents of the London Missionary Society, or Roman Catholics.

The Ellice and Gilbert Groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 5° N. latitude and 10° S. latitude, and 170° to 180° E. longitude. The principal export is copra. The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race, and number about 30,000; and are most of them adherents of American missions, or of the London Missionary Society. The islands have separate kings or chiefs, who are assisted by councils of chiefs and commoners. Labourers go for periods of three years to Fiji and Tahiti, and have also been recruited for Mexico. These groups have now been placed under British protection. Courts of law have been established amongst the natives, and a revenue is obtained from native contributions and trade licenses, which it is expected will cover the cost of maintaining a regular government in the islands. The efforts of Mr. C. R. Swayne, the first British Resident, and of his successor Mr. W. T. Campbell, to establish an efficient system of administration have met with considerable success. An agreement has been entered into with a Sydney firm for the establishment of regular steam communication between these islands and Fiji.

The Southern Solomon Islands consist of the islands of New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaya, San Christoval, Rennell, Bollona, and Stewart's Islands, and smaller islands in the vicinity of the above, lying between the 74th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians. Stations have been established by the Melanesian Mission, but the converts are not numerous. The natives are treacherous; most of them are cannibals, and many of them are head-hunters. In 1896 an expedition from the Austrian war vessel "Albatross," while attempting the ascent of Mount Lammas, in Guadalcanar, were attacked and severe loss of life ensued. There are a few resident traders, mostly of British nationality. A large number of natives used to go to work on plantations in Queensland, Fiji, and Samoa, returning after the expiration of three years; but the number is less than formerly. The principal articles of trade are copra, pearl shell, and tortoiseshell. The climate is not a good one. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893, and a Resident has now been appointed. His headquarters are at Tulagi, a small island on the north side of Guadalcanar. There is a fairly regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

The Santa Cruz Islands are situated between the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides Group. The natives are Melanesians, and are mostly adherents of the Melanesian Mission. The principal trade is in copra. These islands, together with the Duff and Reef Groups, Cherry, Mitre and Tucifia Islands, were in 1898 included in the Southern Solomons Protectorate, and are now subject to the Regulations under which that Protectorate is administered.

The New Hebrides Group lies between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The population has been estimated at from 100,000 to 140,000, but the Mission returns place it at only 50,000. Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church. The larger number of the natives are still cannibals. Life is, however, safer than in the Solomon Islands. Native labourers go to Queensland, Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia; but in much smaller numbers than formerly. There is a European population of about 180, mostly British or French. French and Australian companies have been formed for trading and planting purposes. A British steamer, connecting with steamers from Sydney, runs regularly in the group, and a French steamer also runs from New Caledonia. The principal export is copra, and bananas; coffee, timber, and sulphur are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is bad, and malarial fever is prevalent. A joint commission, consisting of British and French naval officers, has been appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order.

COOK OR HERVEY ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

Administration.

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and the Hervey Islands, Mannai, Anoter and Takutia by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

The Resident is paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reports direct to the Governor of that Colony. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moss, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continues to enjoy self-government in such purely local
affairs as it can properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government is composed of the Ariki, or Kings and Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, is the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court has been established, and a law has been passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 5 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts are subject to the approval of the Resident.

Description.

The Cook Islands are about 1,700 miles from Auckland by steamer. The most southerly, Mangaia, is in latitude 21° 47' south, and the most northerly, Aitutaki, in 18° 15' south. Rarotonga, the most westerly, is in 160° west, and Mauke, the furthest to the east, lies in 157° west longitude. The group consists of seven islands—Mangaia, Atiu, Mauke, Mitiaro, the Hervey Islands proper, Aitutaki, and Rarotonga. The so-called Hervey Islands are an atoll, with the usual low islets on the surrounding reef, and are frequented by the natives from Aitutaki to make copra from the coconuts, which grow luxuriantly and without care in such positions.

Rarotonga is the most important, being the only island in the group with harbours. There are three small harbours in the coral reef with which this island is fringed. The best of these, Avatiu, is the centre of trade for the group. There is also good anchorage outside the reef. Rarotonga is very beautiful and fertile, having a volcanic surface soil with coral subsoil. The island is small—about 25 miles in circuit—but the central hills rise to a height of nearly 3,005 feet. Water is consequently good and abundant. The climate is good and unusually cool. The native population is over 2,000. The foreign residents number some 50 adult males, engaged in trade or planting. They are chiefly British, with a mixture of Americans, Germans, French, and Chinese. There is a resident European missionary, and a native school in which teachers are trained for mission service in other islands in connection with the London Missionary Society. Several of these teachers have for some time past been doing good service in other Pacific Islands, and in New Guinea.

Mangaia is of about the same size as Rarotonga, but chiefly a coral formation, and less fertile. The climate is equally good, but the hills do not reach 500 feet in height. The population is about 2,000, with only 4 Europeans who are engaged in trade. There is a resident English missionary and native school.

Aitutaki is smaller than Mangaia, but of the same character. It is surrounded by an ocean coral reef as well as a shore reef. The ocean reef is said to be 60 miles in circuit, and the lagoon thus formed off one end of the island is a large sheet of water capable, by a moderate outlay, of being made suitable for large vessels. Population: native, 1,500, with only one European trader. There is also a resident English missionary and native school.

Atiu, Mauke, and Mitiaro are all under the king of Atiu. Atiu resembles Aitutaki, but Mauke and Mitiaro are smaller. The joint populations are about 1,800. There are only two foreign residents, and the missionaries in charge are native teachers from Rarotonga.

Communication within each island is entirely by roads or tracks. They have no river nor coastal traffic. Between the islands communication is entirely by sailing vessel; very uncertain and irregular. From Tahiti come regular trading vessels, and also from San Francisco. The only steam communication is by the "Richmond" on her round trip from Auckland to Tonga, Samoa, and Tahiti, calling at Rarotonga once in five weeks, on her return from Tahiti to Auckland.

Productions.—Cotton, coffee, tobacco, copra, arrowroot, fungus, oranges, limes, bananas, and all tropical fruits flourish luxuriantly. Orange and lime trees produce abundantly, and of excellent quality, and all kinds of native food—taro, breadfruit, kumera, yams, bananas, and the indigenous plantain, are fine and plentiful. Many products of a temperate clime do well, and cattle, except sheep, thrive well on an indigenous species of canch or wire grass.

Trade.

The principal exports in 1897 were coffee, value 10,754l.; copra, value 5,380l.; oranges, value 3,965l.; and limejuice, value 832l. The total exports in 1897 were 21,751l., as against 20,709l. in 1896. The imports in the same years were 26,861l. and 23,068l. respectively.
