The Leeward Islands, so called in contrast to the Windward Islands, which are most exposed to the N.E. Trade, the prevailing wind in the West Indies, form the most northerly group of the Lesser Antilles, the whole of which were included among the Windward Islands as the term was used by the Spaniards. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland, (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), and France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin). The English Leeward Islands (except Sombrero, see page 289), comprising the Presidencies of Antigua, with its dependencies, Barbuda and Redonda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, and Nevis, including Anguilla, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the Colony is 70;
square miles, about the size of the county of Surrey, and its population about 127,728.

History.

The Islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1498, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1838, by the Act 3 and 4 Will. IV, c. 74.

The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Colonies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 46 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler, but more subject to hurricanes. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December.

Constitution.

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 15 of 1882, the Legislative Council now consists of ten elective and ten non-elective members. Four elective members are chosen by the elective members of the Island Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Assembly of Dominica, and four by the non-official members of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The non-elective members appointed by the Queen are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Administrator of St. Kitts and Nevis, with five unofficial members, one from each of the island councils, and another member of one of them who acts as President.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, procedure in maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets once a year, at a place notified by proclamation (usually at St. John, Antigua), and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts from two to four weeks.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies, Antigua bearing five-sixteenths, Dominica three-sixteenths, Montserrat one-sixteenth, St. Kitts and Nevis three-eighths, and the Virgin Islands one-sixteenth.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the Queen's pleasure, and the Queen has power at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from both Councils.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. In addition to these, the gold doubloons are legal tender. The Colonial Bank has a branch in Antigua, one in St. Kitts, and one in Dominica. In the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, and Nevis, there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (£3,500l.), and St. Kitt's (£14,000l.), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies except the Virgin Islands.

Means of Communication.

Mail communication exists between England and the Southern Islands, including Trinidad, and with the Northern Islands and Jamaica, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the same islands, as far as Trinidad, and to the United States of America, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line. The Royal Mail Company also runs a steamer on regular days in each week, connecting the various islands of the
group, under a contract with the Colonial Government. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scrutton's Direct Line and others. The usual time occupied by the voyage from England to Antigua is about 14 days.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia and Martinique, and two St. Kitts with Antigua and St. Thomas; Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable station to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

Postage.

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union, but in the case of the U.K., India, and certain Colonies* letter postage was reduced to 1d. per ½ oz. from 25th Dec., 1898. Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Dominica, the rates being 1d. the ½ oz. within each of the islands.

Chief Towns.

The most important towns are St. John (Antigua), 10,000; Basseterre (St. Kitts), 7,000; and Roseau (Dominica), 4,500.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

There is now a Volunteer Defence Force in both Antigua and St. Kitts, consisting in the former case of infantry, in the latter of infantry and mounted infantry.

There are numerous old forts, mostly dismantled and in ruins, situated round the coasts of the several islands.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans, and Roman Catholics. The schools established by these denominations receive grants in aid from the local revenues of each Presidency. School fees are charged, and the schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants in aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. There are about 125 aided schools, attended by 25,022 children. Grants of varying amount are also made to grammar schools established in all the islands except the Virgin Islands. Provision is also being made for technical education.

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 580), and Redonda (population 120) are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62½ square miles. Barbuda lies about 25 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 miles is very flat, with a large lagoon on the west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was long owned by the Codrington family. It produces some salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing, exporting cattle to Antigua. It is one of the few islands where wild deer are still found. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 25 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 23° 6' N. lat., 61° 35' W. long., 1 mile by ¼ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered 1865, now worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license at 6d. per ton royalty. On an average 7,000 tons are annually exported to the United States, 90 men being employed.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1663, Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. The island is in the main low lying and has no forests, and is liable to hurricanes, which occur principally in the month of August.

| 1897 | 47·8                        |

On the 22nd March, 1898, the Legislative Council, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated by the Governor, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new Council consists of sixteen members, eight official and eight non-official, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Governor presides.

The chief productions are sugar and pine-apples, but much of the land has been allowed to become ruined in the hands of the old planting families. There are 87 estates in cultivation, comprising 17,900 acres. St. John, the chief town, has a population of 10,000, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1894, 49 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 1,325. The other towns are Falmouth and Parham.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

The Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis, and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1892.

The total population is 48,963 by the census of 1891, and the total area about 153 square miles, about the size of Rutland.

Constitution.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of ten official and ten nominated unofficial members; the Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator appointed by him, presides, and the Administrator enjoys an original and also a casting vote. Of the ten unofficial members, seven are chosen from among the inhabitants of St. Christopher and Anguilla, and three from Nevis. The council meets at Basseterre in St. Christopher, and is convened at such times as the Governor or Administrator sees fit.

Severe drought 1894-95.
Industry.

Tobacco was at first the principal crop grown, but it soon lost its pre-eminence, and the main industry of the two larger islands is now the production of sugar, molasses, and rum. Arrow-root, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco are also grown in small quantities. Cattle are raised. Salt is produced in St. Kitts and Anguilla. The sugar crop of 1896 amounted to 14,822 tons for St. Kitts and Nevis, and the export of rum was 37,100 gallons, and of molasses 2,891 puncheons. Sugar products form 99% per cent. of the total exports.

In 1896 a volunteer force was raised, consisting of Mounted Infantry, 55; Infantry, 57; total 112. This force is increasing in strength, and now numbers 179 officers and men.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital. Basseterre, population about 10,000, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1894, 34 sailing vessels of 1,183 tons.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The temperature is from 78° to 85°.

The rainfall for the year 1897 was 37.4 inches.

Total area under cultivation:

| Island | Acres |
|-------|-------|
| St. Kitts | 18,385 |
| Nevis | 6,808 |

St. Kitts, the native name of which was Liamuiga, or "the fertile island," was the first settled of the Leeward group. Thomas Warner was despatched thither in 1623 by Mr. Ralph Merrifield, but a hurricane destroyed the first results of his first efforts at cultivation, and it was only in 1625, when he had obtained the patronage and assistance of the Earl of Carlisle, and a commission as King's Lieutenant over St. Kitts, alias Morwar's Hope, Nevis, Barbados, and Monserrat, that a permanent lodgment was effected. On the very day that Warner landed, Desnambuc, with a few Frenchmen, reached the island, and in the face of the common enemy, the Caribs, the two colonies settled peacefully side by side, the French obtaining the two ends of the island and the English the middle portion. From thence all the other islands in the group were colonized, and the settlement grew fast. In 1629 they were almost destroyed by the Spaniards, but soon recovered. The war with France and Holland, in the early part of the reign of Charles II, led to a struggle between the colonists of the rival nations, ending in a victory for the French, the English settlers capitulating in 1666. The English part of the island was restored at the peace of Breda, 1667. The same thing happened during the war of the Spanish Succession, and it was not till the Treaty of Utrecht that the island in its entirety passed into the hands of Great Britain. With all the other Leeward Islands it was captured by the French in the beginning of the wars of the French Revolution, but was re-captured after Rodney's victory in 1783.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he appointed in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it. It has a population of about 1,500, and is a port of registry.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two Islands—the distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at £500., and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,800, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock, which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the
productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, licences, &c.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 291 square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1768, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £12,092l. 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously
secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising also Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771 the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, the Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor. Trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican chief, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Serious riots occurred in 1893 in connexion with the collection of taxes in the interior of the Island. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. "Mohawk," were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results.

An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who left for Dominica in November, 1893, and returned to England in December of the same year.

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies.

It is estimated that about 130,000 acres in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar has still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is rich and the climate healthy, and the island is well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, especially Arabian, and on the higher slopes in the centre of the island, where a commencement in this direction has recently been made, cocoa, tea, limes, nutmegs, spices, and tropical fruits of all kinds.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, ash and scoria covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers well stocked with fish, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Coffee, cocoa, and lime-juice are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, is now only exported in comparatively small quantities. A considerable trade is carried on also in fruit, spices, oils, and timber. The principal exports in 1897 were: Coffee, 16,065 lbs.; cocoa, 616,298 lbs.; sugar, 565 tons; limes and lime-juice, value 14,007l.; essential oils, value 4,960l.; fruit and vegetables, 1,754l.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1897 was 78.77 inches; the mean temperature 82.4 Fahr.

The chief town is Roseau, population about 4,500; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1897, six vessels, of a total tonnage of 100 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of the Colonial Bank at Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 10 members. In July 1895 the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abrogating itself, and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new council consists of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Administrator presides in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency.

Electors for a parish must possess land or houses to be rented at 4l. per annum, or be an occupier of premises worth 8l. per annum, or have an income of 25l., or pay taxes of 15s. per annum.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants speak a French patois.

MONTSERRAT.

This island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 32 square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Soufrière Hill (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. The cultivated land is mainly on the western and south-eastern sides. Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of 1,500, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1897, 4 sailing vessels, total tonnage 77 tons.

Montserrat was colonized by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants: it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. After undergoing various modifications they became merged in a Legislative Assembly, which lasted down to 1867.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly, a Legislative Council was established, having all the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. Her Majesty may from time to time appoint such persons, not exceeding six in all, as she may think fit, to be respectively official, or ex officio and unofficial members of the said Council, every councillor holding office during Her Majesty's pleasure.

The principal export of the island is sugar, which is shipped in tierces and barrels: 3 tierces equal 12 hogsheads. In a very good year the crop yields 2,500 hogsheads. In 1892 the export was 2,500 hogsheads, value 20,559L. The export of lime-juice for the same year was valued at 4,859L.

Many sugar works are furnished with steam-engines, but there are still some few properties which rely on the windmill; there are a few cattle mills, and two or three mills are worked by water power.

The export of next importance is lime-juice, raw and concentrated. There are (principally in the northern part of the island) about 1,000 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation is extending. It is principally in the hands of the Montserrat Company, Limited.

The cultivation of coffee and cocoa has recently been reintroduced, the export of the former product amounting in 1896 to 25,455 lbs.

There are seven Anglican schools with 4,681 scholars, three Wesleyan with 672, one Roman Catholic with 118, and two undenominational with 511 scholars—in all 2,764 children at school.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, macadamized, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects, as far as the small revenue of the island will permit.

The island is considered to be the most healthy of the Antilles.

The rainfall in 1896, was 94 inches, and the mean temperature is about 81°.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to westward of and adjacent to Porto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British Islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dyke, Peter's Island, Salt Island, and all others not now actually in possession of Denmark with the exception of Biques, or Crab Island, and Culebra, which are Spanish. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. Sombrero is British, but is not included in the Colony.

The Danes possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government, and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government, who is to preside at the meetings of the Council, and to have a casting as well as a deliberation vote.

There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Roadtown, Tortola, population 400, which is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1890, 19 vessels, of a total tonnage of 841.

A small quantity of sugar is made in the Virgin Islands, and during the American Civil War the landed proprietors planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly. The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise a few cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands, makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their trade and intercourse is with the Danish Islands, and to a smaller extent with Hayti and San Domingo. The currency consists almost entirely of Danish silver and copper, which are not legal tender.

On October 29th, 1867, the islands were visited by a fearful hurricane, which was most destructive to life and property.

The islands also suffered severely, but not to so great an extent, in the hurricane of August, 1871.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great.

Large quantities of fibrous plants (Aganes and Bromelas) grow wild everywhere in Tortola.

The mail communication is by small sailing craft to St. Thomas, which is touched at fortnightly by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's steamers.

**MALTA.**

**Situation and Area.**

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. Valletta, the port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 91.557 square miles; that of Gozo 24.804 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filifa and Cominotto are but islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

**History.**

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino mention is made at very early date. The Phoenicians settled in them in B.C. 1519, according to some authors, whilst others give the date B.C. 1400. Diodorus Siculus describes Malta and Gozo as most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. They were afterwards under the dominion of the Greeks, and then of the Carthaginians. During the Punic wars the Maltese islands fell alternately to the lot of the Carthaginians and Romans, and were ultimately occupied by the latter. During the Roman occupation the shipwreck of Paul took place (Acts xxviii). On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell into the hands of the Goths, and then into those of the Saracens, who were expelled in 1090 by Count Roger the Norman. It was under the dominion of the House of Aragon from 1190 until 1550, when it was granted by the Roman Emperor Charles V to the Order of the Knights of St. John, by whom it was held for more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, the Grand Master Hompesch capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte, who dispersed the Order. The Maltese, however, rose against the French, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they were closely blockaded by the British fleet aided by the Maltese for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered, and the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain, 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

**Climate.**

The climate of Malta is equable and very healthy in winter. In August the heat at the sea level approaches that experienced in the tropics. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind. The maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 61½° Fahr., and the minimum 58½°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is 82½° Fahr., and the minimum 73½°. The mean temperature is 67°, and the annual rainfall varies from 10 to 20 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous sandstone beds, and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

**Industry.**

The island is highly cultivated; its principal products are cotton, potatoes, and corn; the vine is grown; oranges of very superior quality and figs are abundant; honey of a superior kind is also produced; and early crops of potatoes and onions are exported to England. Many cattle, sheep, horses and goats are reared. But a large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the enormous trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepôt and port of call. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1897—124 vessels of together 10,408 tons register. There is a large trade with Tunis, Tripoli, Algeria, Italy, and the Levant.

**Chief Towns.**

The population, according to the census, 1891, is 177,457, including garrison, Royal Navy, and merchant shipping. The chief town and capital is Valletta, having with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's, a population of 37,909 in 1891. The "three cities" on the other side of the harbour from Valletta (Senglea, Cospicua, and Victoria) have a population of 26,787. Citta Vecchia, the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, has a population of 8,008 in 1891. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), population 6,124.

**Inhabitants.**

The inhabitants of the country districts resemble the southern Italians in appearance, and in some districts show distinct traces of their Punic descent. In the towns and among the upper classes are to be found representatives of families who have settled in Malta from many different countries. The Maltese dialect which is generally spoken is of Semitic origin, and is held to be derived from the Carthaginian and Arabic tongues. The educated and commercial classes usually speak also Italian.
or English, or both. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, hard-working, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found as traders in Tunis, Egypt, and around the Mediterranean coast.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is, under Order in Council of September 24th, 1886, exclusively British. There are two local banks (Banco di Malta and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The first two banks have a small note circulation, reported to amount to about 20,000l., and the deposits in the three banks are estimated at about 200,000l. The Government savings bank, established in 1838, had on 31st December, 1897, 514,378l. deposits.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway 8 miles in length and 3 feet 3 in. gauge, now belonging to the Malta Government, which was originally built by the Malta Railway Company at the cost of about 90,000l., and there are 65 miles of telegraph, constructed and worked by the military authorities, but open to public use. Valetta has an extensive telephone system (350 miles in 1897), and is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables to Gibraltar, Bone (Algeria), Sicily (2), Alexandria (2), and Zante.

It is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is a most important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling in quarantine, and at any hour, day and night, and for ensuring the delivery of full weight of bunker coals when owners call for a Custom House certificate of weight. There is direct mail communication with nearly every Mediterranean port, several times per week, and with England, via Sicily or Ruggio or Brindisi, daily, except on Sundays. The rates of postage* are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Internal | 2½d. Free |
| Europe, Tunis, the Levant, the United States, and all Postal Union Countries | 2½d. ¼d. per 2 oz. |

The total correspondence despatched in 1897 was: Letters 2,067,403; post cards, 49,413; newspapers, 873,405. Internal correspondence received and despatched: Letters and postcards, 1,634,555; newspapers, 679,107.

Public Works.

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and has greatly improved their sanitary condition. The reorganization of the water supply, hitherto very defective, has also been taken in hand, and considerable water works have been established for raising and distributing at high pressure an effective supply of pure water for all purposes. These works have now been extended to all the large villages and to Gozo. In connection with this work arrangements are contemplated for an extension of the means of irrigation, and for utilizing drainage. Considerable progress has also been made lately in improving the roads and streets and in public lighting. Electric lighting has been installed and is being worked in Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities, including the Great Harbour and Marsamuscetto Harbour. The harbour accommodation has been greatly improved, a loan of 20,000l. having been made from Imperial funds in 1873 to the Anglo-Maltese Hydraulic Dock Company, under the Colonial Docks Act.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, established in 1881, and reconstituted in 1887; it consists of ten members besides the President and the clerk. Legislation is carried on by means of a partly elective council of government originally constituted by letters patent of 11th May, 1849, and re-constituted by letters patent of 12th Dec., 1887 (amended in 1898). It now consists of six official members and thirteen elected, three of whom are returned by special electors, and chosen from the classes of nobles, university graduates, and members of the chamber of commerce respectively. Public officers are ineligible for election, and not more than two ecclesiastics may be chosen by the general electors. The islands are divided into ten electoral districts, returning one member each. The total number of electors is over 10,000. The qualification for a member of Council is the possession of immovable property of the clear value of 100l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of rent for immovable property to the annual value of 10l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of 40l. a year for board and lodging, for the same period previous to election. The qualification for a general elector is an income from immovable property of 6l. per annum, or the payment of rent to the amount of 6l. per annum for six calendar months before registration, or, independently of both, the age of twenty-one years, and qualification to serve as a common juror. That of a special elector, and of the members elected by this class, is an income from immovable property of 60l., or payment of rent of that amount. The Council of Government, unless sooner dissolved, lasts three years. The Governor is ex officio President, with the power of veto. A Vice-President was appointed by Letters Patent dated 6th February, 1893. The Governor, or the Vice-President, if present, may depute an official member to preside. There are no municipalities or other forms of local government.

Education and Religion.

Elementary education is carried on almost exclusively in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are two secondary schools with 157 scholars, and 119 elementary and infants' schools with 14,836 pupils. There is a public lyceum with 438 scholars, and a university (founded in 1769) with 155 students. At these two latter institutions the fees are extremely low, being respectively 1s. and 2s. 6d. per family per month. There are numerous private secondary schools. The total number of these schools is 116, with 3,679 scholars. Education is not compulsory. The Roman Catholic religion is almost universal amongst the Maltese.

Defence.

Malta is the principal naval station in the Mediterranean, and is strongly fortified. Valetta is defended by massive and extensive works, and the garrison of 9,058 N.C.O.'s and men includes 694 R.M.A., 1,596 R.M. Militia, and 53 Malta Militia Division, Royal Engineers. The Island Government contributes 5,000l. for military contribution.

*A new rate on parcels exchanged with the U.K. (by direct steamer) came into force on the 1st of Jan., 1899. (See p. 27)*
Revenue.

There is no direct taxation of any kind. The most important sources of revenue are the Customs duties, port dues, and land revenue.

Weights and Measures.

Malta barrel is equal to 9½ imperial gallons.
" salm " 1 quarter.
" cantar " 175 lbs. English.
" caffiso " 4½ imperial gallons.
