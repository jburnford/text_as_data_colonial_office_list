MAURITIUS.

Situation and Area.

Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 18' and 57° 49' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat., distant 115 miles from Réunion, 940 miles from Seychelles, 1,800 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 705 square miles (nearly equal to Surrey), having an extreme length of 36 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 28 miles from east to west. The Dependencies have an area of 172 square miles.

The formation of the island is supposed to be volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude. The highest peak, the Piton de la Rivière-Noire, is 2,711 English feet, and Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable beyond a few hundred yards from the sea.

History.

The island was discovered by the Portugués in 1507, but the first people that occupied it in any great numbers were the Dutch, in 1598, whose commander, Admiral J. C. Van Neck, named it Mauritius, in honour of the then Statholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. The Dutch, however, though they built a fort at Grand Port, do not appear to have made any permanent settlement, and they finally abandoned the island in 1712. A party of Frenchmen landed there in 1715, and in 1721 it was formally taken possession of by the French, at first on behalf of the French East India Company, and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the Crown of France. The name of the island was then changed by M. Du Fresne, captain in the naval service of France, into that of Isle of France, which it retained till the landing of the English in 1810, when its former name of Mauritius was again restored to it. The most celebrated of the French Governors was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735—1746), "a man of eminent talents and virtues" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane, and of many other valuable plants, and was the real founder of the prosperity of the island.

Mauritius was during the earlier part of the long war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, from the facility with which sorties were made from it by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810; the laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The island was visited by a terrible hurricane on the 29th of April, 1892, which caused an enormous destruction of buildings and crops.

On the 23rd of July, 1893, a part of the town of Fort Louis was entirely destroyed by fire.

On the 22nd February, 1894, during a small cyclone, a railway train was blown down in a ravine at Pailles Bridge; five persons were killed and great loss of material sustained.

General Description.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other
tropical colony. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French nobles. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture. The natives are proud of their country, and of the designation of Creoles.

Nine daily newspapers and five other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language is spoken all over the island, English being used in the courts of justice. Debates in the council of Government may take place in either language.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Riviere du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhelms, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of 55,645 souls. The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive more than a hundred vessels. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The trade of the island passes almost entirely through Port Louis. The city has an elected municipal corporation, and raised in 1897 a revenue of Rs. 596,977-87 (the balance on hand on 1st Jan., 1897, being Rs. 9,510-76), against an expenditure of Rs. 598,291-90. Its debt amounts to 182,300l. and Rs. 277,049.

The principal public edifices of Port Louis are the Government House, the Institute, the Roman Catholic and Protestant cathedrals, the Royal College, the Town Hall, the theatre, the public offices, &c.

After Port Louis, the largest town is Curepipe, incorporated in 1888 (population 11,291, census of 1891), situated on the uplands in the Plaines Wilhelms. Its climate is temperate, and many families reside in the numerous villas there during the summer season, while they spend the winter months in Port Louis.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg (population 3,257, census of 1891), so called in honour of M. Mahé de Labourdonnais.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1884-85. It now consists of a Governor, with an Executive Council of five officials and two elected members, and a Legislative Council of twenty-seven members, eight being ex officio, nine nominated by the Governor, and ten elected on a moderate franchise—two for the town of Port Louis, and one for each of the eight rural districts. At least one-third of the nominated members must be persons not holding any public office. Members are not paid; they may speak either in French or English. The number of registered electors in 1897 was 6,230; the franchise qualification is ownership of immovables worth Rs. 300, or movables worth Rs. 3,000, or payment of rent of Rs. 25 monthly, or of license duty of 200 Rs. annually, or receipt of a salary of Rs. 50 monthly. The session usually lasts from April to December.

The law is based on the Code Napoleon, and other French laws modified by Colonial Ordinances.

**Climate, &c.—** From December to April is the hottest season in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The temperature on the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The climate at Curepipe, from 1,700 to 1,900 feet above the sea, resembles that of the South of France or Italy. The hurricane season extends from December to the end* of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 30° S. latitude.

**Water Supply.**—A reservoir on the Grande Riviere for the supply of Port Louis Town was constructed some years ago by the municipality. The works begun by the Government in 1885 for supplying pure water from the upland springs to the chief centres of population are complete. The mains extend from the Mare aux Vacoas—with branches—the whole covering a surface of 44 miles. The reservoirs and canals so constructed can supply three and a half millions of gallons per day. These waterworks cost Rs. 480,000. The fever has decreased in the localities now supplied with this upland water. Further works of an important character were commenced during 1892, for the purification of the Mare aux Vacoa water by filtration, and for its extension to the town of Curepipe. The estimated cost, including purchase of lands, was Rs. 909,358. These additional works are now completed, and the filtered water is being delivered.

**Scenery.**—The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an Engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the last century,

*There is no record of the Island having been visited by a hurricane later than the 12th of April, with the exception of the disastrous one of 1892.*
scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane; the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

Railways.—There are four lines of railway, all owned and worked by Government. (1) The North line, from Port Louis to the sea coast village of Grand River, south-east. Its length is 31 miles, and its course is approximately parallel to the northern coast line of the island. (2) The Midland line, beginning at Port Louis and running across the island to the sea coast town of Mahébourg on the other side; its length is 36 miles, with a summit level of 1,822 feet; the gradient in many places is 1 in 27. (3) The Moka Flacq line, from the Rose Hill station on the Midland line to Rivière Sèche station on the North line; length 27 miles. (4) Savanne branch from Rosebelle station on the Midland line to the sea coast town of Souillac at the southern extremity of the island; its length is 11 miles. The total number of miles of railway now open is 105, the total cost up to date being about 771,649l. and Rs. 864,249-92. At Curepipe the elevation of the railway is 1,822 feet above the sea. The receipts in 1897 were Rs. 1,712,322-86, and the expenditure, Rs. 1,166,438-77.

Religion.—The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the last census, the Roman Catholics numbered 115,436, and the Protestants 7,367. The Roman Catholics received in 1897 Government aid amounting to Rs. 102,520 and the Protestants Rs. 41,116.

Education.—The department of public instruction comprises two branches, the Royal College for higher education, and the Schools Department for primary education. The College is under the control of a Rector, who is assisted by a staff of professors. The Schools Department is under the direction of a Superintendent, aided by two Inspectors.

The Government schools are supported wholly by the State; the grant schools only partially so. There were in 1897:

| Number | Pupils |
|--------|--------|
| Government schools | 81 | 9,931 |
| Grant schools | 99 | 9,356 |

Total 180 | 19,287

Total Number of Pupils.

The relative numbers are shown by the following percentages:

Members of Church of England | 2-19% |
Roman Catholics | 72-38% |
Members of other Christian denominations | 1-29% |
Mahomedans | 7-40% |
Hindus and others | 16-74% |

The total expenditure on education in 1897 amounted to Rs. 495,235, of which Rs. 302,038 were expended on primary education. There are 462 masters and mistresses employed. Of the pupils in the aided schools 76 per cent. are Roman Catholics, 1 per cent. belong to the Church of England, and 1 per cent. to other Christian denominations. No assistance is given to Hindu Schools, but one Assisted Mohammedan School was opened in Plaines Wilhems District during the year 1894.

Military Contribution.—Ordinance No. 33 of 1897 appropriates 5½ per centum of the annual Revenue of Mauritius to the use of the Imperial Government as a military contribution. The total strength of the garrison on 31st Dec., 1897, was 947 men of all ranks. The total military expenditure for the year amounted to 78,558l. The contribution of the colony was 20,756l. and 1,411l. as allowances in lieu of Customs Rebate. A sum of Rs. 19,221 has been spent by the Civil Government on defence works in 1897, the two forts and two batteries for the defence of the harbour of Port Louis, are finished and armed.

The total police force on 31st December, 1897, was 840.

Communications—The mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes leave Marseilles on the 10th and 25th of each month, arriving in Mauritius on the 9th and 19th of the following month respectively. These steamers leave Mauritius on the 14th and 29th of each month, and arrive at Marseilles on the 9th and 30th of the following month respectively. This line receives a subsidy from the Mauritius Government. There is also a four-weekly service with Ceylon by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company; and a four-weekly service with England, via Cape of Good Hope, by the steamers of the Castle line, length of voyage about 6 weeks. There is frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, Réunion, &c. Telegraphic communication is established along and beyond the railway, the total length of line being 135 miles; and cable communication through a branch office of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company with Europe via Seychelles, Zanzibar, and Aden, was opened in November, 1898. Through rate: United Kingdom to Mauritius, 5s. per word; and from Mauritius to United Kingdom, Rs. 4-15.

There are in Mauritius the General Post Office in the city of Port Louis, and 62 branch post offices in the rural districts. Port Louis has a telephone system, with 84 subscribers. In the island of Rodrigues there is one post office at Port Mathurin. There is no post office on any other of the Dependencies. The rates of postage are:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|------------|
| United Kingdom, Countries in Postal Union | 18 cents | 4 cents |
| Dependencies | 18 " | free |
| Seychelles | 18 " | 4 cents |

Parcels Post Rates from 1st July, 1895.—In addition to the following charges, the ruling rate of exchange on the day of posting of such parcels is also levied.

| Via France | Via Colombo |
|------------|-------------|
| Not over 3 lbs. | Rs. c. 1 58 | Rs. c. 1 00 |
| Over 3 lbs. but not over 7 lbs. | 1 88 | 1 5 |
| Over 7 lbs. but not over 11 lbs. | 2 17 | 2 00 |

Commerce.

The island produces hardly anything for its own consumption, but its foreign commerce extends to every quarter of the globe.
The chief exports are sugar, rum, molasses, spice, vanilla, aloe-fibre, oil, soap, &c. Attention is now being turned to the cultivation of tea, with very successful results. Oxen are imported from Madagascar, sheep from South Africa and Australia, and breadstuffs from India.

The imports consist mainly of grain (rice, wheat, &c.), cotton manufactures, wine, coals, hardware, and manure. There is a small tobacco plantation, but sugar production is the greatest industry. About 98 per cent. of the value of the exports is due to shipments of sugar. In 1897 the weight of sugar exported was 138,079,700 kilos., with an estimated value of Rs. 22,310,483. The value of the rum exported was Rs. 60,611; that of vanilla, Rs. 186,611; that of aloe-fibre, Rs. 242,507; that of cocoa-nut oil, Rs. 17,623; and that of soap, Rs. 65,890.

The number of vessels registered at Port Louis is now 68, of a total tonnage of 7,290.

Currency and Banking.

The Mauritius Commercial Bank has establishments in the colony. The total amount of deposits was Rs. 8,842,459-35.

The Bank of Mauritius (Limited) was established in October, 1894, with paid up capital of 125,550L, and opened in Mauritius in Dec., 1894. Total deposits up to end of 1897, Rs. 1,392,159.

A Government savings bank was established in 1865. The total deposits on the 31st December, 1897, amounted to Rs. 2,949,113.

All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is the currency of the island. There are about Rs. 5,000,000 (in coin) in circulation. A Government note issue was re-established in 1876, the notes being legal tender except at the office of issue. The circulation on the 31st December, 1897, was Rs. 3,114,250.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Dependencies.

The numerous dependencies of Mauritius comprise about a hundred islands scattered over the Indian Ocean, and contain a total population of 17,000 inhabitants. They may be roughly divided into four groups, the Seychelles (see p. 231) the Amirantes Group, the Oil Islands and St. Brandon Group, and detached islands, such as Eagle Island, Peros Banhos, and the Solomon Islands. The Amirantes Group lie between 4° 24' and 6° 13' S. lat., and 58° 27' and 55° 7' E. long. They are coral islands, producing cocoanut oil and a little maize, and some of them are used as fishing stations. The chief are Poivre, Darros, African, Eagle, Iles des Roches, Boudeuse, Alphonse, Coetivy, and Platte. The St. Brandon, or Carajados Islands (Albatross, Tromelin, and Coco), lie between 16° 20' and 16° 50' S. lat., and 59° 26' and 59° 41' E. long. Most of them are mere sand-banks, and their only produce is a little salt fish. The Chagos Islands, the Trois Freres or Eagle Islands, and the Cosmoledo Islands, which are known generally as the Oil Islands, lie between 6° 40' and 9° 40' S. lat. and 72° 22' and 47° 48' E. long. The chief are North, South, Polyte, Wizard, and Menai. Amongst the detached islands may be named Assumption, Astove, St. Pierre, Providence, Cerf, Farquhar, and the Aldabra, but none of these have any permanent population.

Rodrigues, the most important dependency of Mauritius after the Seychelles, is situated in latitude S. 19° 41' and longitude E. 63° 23', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a magistrate, who takes his instructions from the Governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the Governor of Mauritius in executive council. The estimated population on 31st December, 1897, was 2,772.

The island, which is volcanic, mountainous, and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good; sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla grow luxuriantly.

During the time of slavery fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years cultivation has been neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guineas fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard-apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmiste and waxo trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and fruit.

Diego Garcia, the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horse-shoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is a coral atoll, fifteen miles by six and a-half, nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end and from two to five miles in breadth.

Situated as Diego Garcia is, at 7° latitude S. and between 72° and 73° longitude east, on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin, it affords great convenience for coaling purposes to steamers, and coal depots have been established on the island by commercial companies. In 1885 it was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius, which was, however, withdrawn in 1888.
