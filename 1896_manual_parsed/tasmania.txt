TASMANIA.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide; the important colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 40' and 43°38' S. lat., and 144° 30' and 148° 20' E. long.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Diemen's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1853. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian colonies.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.
From observations taken at Hobart for 1894 the highest shade temperature recorded was 89°0 on the 25th Nov., and the lowest 35°0 on the 9th May and 5th Aug. The mean range for the year was 14°9. Rain fell on 151 days in the year, and the rainfall was a little more than 27 inches.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 1,789 miles of telegraph (with 8,004 miles of wire) open in the colony. This excludes 366 miles of cable belonging to the Tasmanian Cable Company. The total cost of telegraph construction up to 31st Dec., 1894, was 203,051l., the receipts in 1894 being 20,135l., and the working expenses 32,386l. There are also 488 miles of telephone, which yield an annual rental of 3,947l.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The number of messages sent was 260,423, of which 71,900 were cable.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Launceston twice and sometimes three times a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney every week. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and Melbourne, and Hobart and New Zealand twice a month. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Colombo and London every week; time 40 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 40 days. The mail steamer via Vancouver, once a month. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Batavia, Aden, and Brindisi every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 55 days. Direct communication is also afforded by the three lines of steamers, one of which calls at Hobart every month.

In addition to above, mails are deposited by Messageries Maritimes de France and per German Line packets once a month.

There are 327 places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

| Letters per oz. | Newspapers |
|-----------------|------------|
| Within a town    | 1d.        | free       |
| Australasia     | 2½d.      | ½d.        |
| Europe, United States, &c. | 2½d. | 1d. |

The number of letters received and despatched was 5,536,907; postcards, 186,960; packets, 1,286,784; newspapers, 4,447,619.

Area.

The Colony contains 26,215 square miles, the main island, containing about 15½ million acres of land, and the smaller islands connected with it contain 1¼ million acres; 4,807,070 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown; leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 11,970,930 acres, of which 472,705 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass' Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group, including Flinder's Island, Robins Island, King Island, and Bruny Island on the east coast.

Roads.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in excellent order by the Government; all the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the treasury. In 1894 the maintenance of main roads cost 26,967l., of cross and bye roads 20,244l.

Railways.

There are now 475½ miles of railway in the colony constructed, mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. Of this 475½ miles of railway, 122 miles were purchased from the Tasmanian Main Line Railway Company at a cost of 1,135,968l., paid for by inscribed stock bearing interest at the rate of 3½ per cent., redeemable in 1940. The total cost of railway construction, including cost of 7½ miles owned by private company, but worked by government, up to 31st Dec., 1894, was 3,768,297l., the gross receipts in 1894 being 157,660l., and the working expenses 131,740l., showing a return of 0·69 per cent. on the capital.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; and the upset price of pastoral lands a sum equal to 12 years' rental, but not less than 3s. an acre.

Under Crown Lands Acts, 54 Vic., No. 8, any person may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not exceeding 320 acres, at 1l. an acre, with 38 per cent. for credit, payable by quarterly instalments for 14 years. Under Crown Lands Acts, 57 Vic., No. 12, any one of the age of 18 may take up land, not less than 15 acres, or more than 50 acres, on payment of a registration fee of 1l., and no further payment, provided the land is improved, is to be made until the fourth year.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, hides, skins, and leather, hops, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark. The value of the principal exports in 1894 was: Tin, 202,454l.; gold, 218,629l.; silver, 215,394l.; tame fruits, &c., of the value of 202,455l.; timber and bark, 57,256l.; wool, 263,422l.; potatoes, 70,337l.; and copper, 110,613l.

The land in cultivation on 31st March, 1894, was 550,865 acres. There were in the colony 169,141 horned cattle, and 1,535,047 sheep. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1894 was 9,176,835 lbs., valued at 263,422l.

Almost the whole of the trade is with Australia and the United Kingdom.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, some of which are now being turned to account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, but have not yet been utilised. Rich deposits and lodes of tin are worked in various parts of the island; the principal workings are at Mount Bischoff, in the north-west, and Branxholm, in the north-east. The value of tin exported up to 31st December, 1894, was 6,060,762l. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. There exists in the island an enormous lode of bismuth, said to be the richest in the world. Copper and antimony...
have also been found, the most important centre being Mount Lyell; the copper yielding 30 per cent. of metal. Great discoveries of silver have also been made in the neighbourhood of Mount Zeehan and Mount Dundas on the west coast, and a railway to connect the mines with the coast has been constructed and opened for traffic. Some assays of the ore have yielded as much as 1,800 ozs. to the ton, and there is no doubt that the fields when developed will prove amongst the richest in the world. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

Hobart and Launceston are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1894, 218 vessels, of 18,284 aggregate tonnage.

Population.

The population in 1881 was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females.

On 5th April, 1891, the population of Tasmania was 146,667, of whom 77,560 were males, and 69,107 females, being 560 persons to the square mile. The death-rate of 1894 was 12-42 to the 1,000 of the population. The number of inhabited houses not including tents (1,195) was 26,829. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds. Population, 31st December, 1894, was 157,456.

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1891) within the Registration boundary 33,073 inhabitants.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the colony, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 22,351 persons, and is rapidly progressing.

Local Government.

Municipal councils were established in Hobart and Launceston in 1855, when responsible government was granted to the Colony, and under the Rural Municipalities Act of 1865, councils have been established in 21 districts. These councils consist of seven elected members, two retiring annually for two successive years and three every third year. The president of the council, called the Warden, is elected annually by the councillors. The voters for the election of councillors are every male or female over 21 years of age on the assessment roll. There are also 14 Town Boards established in the principal townships in the Police districts. In the districts where there are no municipalities the care of the roads is in the hands of Road Trusts. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, Table Cape, Leven, and Strahan, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards. The total revenue of these various bodies in 1894 was £163,775, and the expenditure £166,755.

The outstanding local debt on 31st December, 1894, was £34,878.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are four banks established in the Colony, viz.: The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, with, together, 44 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1894, amounted to £3,416,061, deposits £2,242,041. The note circulation on same date amounted to £2,702.

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the colony, established by Government in connection with the Post Office Department; total deposits at time of last balancing, 31st December, 1894, being £609,234.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1886 the Board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a director of education, working under the Minister of lands as ministerial head. The system is national and compulsory, but free only to children unable to pay fees, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 249 state schools in operation on 31st December, 1894, the number of scholars on the rolls 14,476, and the average attendance 10,594.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and higher course of education amongst the youth of the colony, the University of Tasmania was established in the year 1890, with power to grant scholarships. In all seven scholarships and exhibitions are now awarded annually.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17), constituting "the Parliament of Tasmania," supplemented by Act 49 Vic., No. 8.

The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 20l. or leasehold of 80l. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-seven members, elected for twenty-nine electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court. The duration of the Assembly is three years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to have his name included in the assessment roll of the district for which his vote is to be given as the owner or occupier of any property, or to be in receipt of income of 60l. sterling per year, for 6 months prior to 1st November in any year. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict., No. 32. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for four months. Members are paid 50l.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

Defence.

The strength of the Colonial Volunteer Force is 571 officers and men. Batteries guard the mouths of the Derwent and Tamar rivers, and there are torpedo boats.
