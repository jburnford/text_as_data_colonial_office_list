CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

It has been now systematically surveyed, and its area is 3,584 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Mesaoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the English troops, and of the High Commissioner who administers the Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalis.

History.

Cyprus was colonized by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too long and eventful to be here related even in outline. When the Roman Empire was divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and was governed by lieutenants of the Byzantine Emperors until 1191, when Richard I of England occupied the island to chastise the ruler, Isaac Comnenus, for the ill-treatment of the English fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could not govern it, the king made it over to Guy de Lusignan, who claimed to be King of Jerusalem, and undertook the obligations of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 until 1489, when Queen Catarina Cornaro, herself a Venetian and widow of James II, having survived her husband and his posthumous son, James III, yielded the government of the island to the
Republic of Venice. Venice ruled the island until 1570-71, when the Ottoman Turks invaded it, and captured and put to the sword the Venetian garrisons.

The island remained under the government of the Sultans of Constantinople from 1571 until 1878, with the exception of the period from 1832 to 1840, when it was held by the Pasha of Egypt, then at war with the Porte. It may be observed that the island was frequently invaded by the Arabs, Saracens, and Egyptians before its final conquest by the Turks, and that from 1426 to 1571, it paid tribute to Egypt. The great fortress and port of Famagusta was held by the Genoese Republic from 1378 until 1464, when the Lusignan king, James II, retook it with the help of the Egyptians.

Climate.

The mean temperature is about 69° Fah.; mean maximum 78°; mean minimum 57°. Highest shade temperature during last ten years 116°; lowest 22°. Average rainfall for last ten years 19-16 inches. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. There has been no drought since 1887. The island may be said to be, in every way, healthy. Malarial fevers exist, but they are not of a severe type.

Population.

The population of the several districts, excluding the military, at the censuses taken in 1881 and 1891, was:

| District     | 1891   | 1881   |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Nicosia      | 61,695 | 56,812 |
| Famagusta    | 41,428 | 38,207 |
| Larnaca      | 23,760 | 20,766 |
| Limassol     | 35,730 | 29,248 |
| Papho        | 31,674 | 28,424 |
| Kyrenia      | 15,004 | 13,216 |

Total ... 209,286 186,178

This shows an increase during the decade of 23,113.

The Moslems form about 28 per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Orthodox Greek Church.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 12,515 (11,586 in 1881) inhabitants; Larnaca, 7,593 (7,833 in 1881); Limassol, 7,888 (6,006 in 1881). The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour; but at present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has only 768 (658 in 1881) inhabitants, nearly all Moslems. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 2,488 (1,906 in 1881), nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktima, the modern capital of Papho, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, where a small harbour has recently been constructed in the district of the same name, on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania.

Industry.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but with the exception of a concession granted in 1886, and since abandoned, they have not been worked in modern times. Gypsum and terra umbra are exported. The wealth of the island consists mainly in its agricultural produce, chiefly corn, cotton, carobs (locust-beans), linseed, olives, silk, raisins, fruit, vegetables, cheese, wool, hides, and wine. The common wines ("mavro") are for the most part exported to France, Egypt, and Turkey; but both the common and the richer wines are exported to Austria, Italy, and France, to be used in giving strength and flavour to the fruit of poor vineyards. Cyprus wine is perhaps somewhat heady for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it derives from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins. This practice is being discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables the wine to be conveyed in barrels. A company has been established, "The Cyprus Company," which is manufacturing wine more suitable for the European market.

The agricultural prosperity of the island is greatly retarded by want of water. The rainfall is somewhat deficient in the whole, and has not been made the best use of; although under measures passed in the Legislature of 1887, 1889, and 1891 facilities are afforded for constructing irrigation works.

Much injury to crops has also been caused in the past by locusts, but the numbers are now inconsiderable and but little damage is done. The work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit system." The screens are stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march, and being topped with oilcloth, the locusts cannot get over them, and are gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which they cannot emerge, as they are topped with a zinc lining. This system, owing to the fact that the locusts are more scattered, has been experimentally discarded in favour of a system of collecting live locusts and locust eggs.

In 1889-94 there were 258,080 sheep and 224,089 goats, a decrease as regards goats, and an increase as regards sheep, in the numbers of the preceding year.

The island, which contains more goats in proportion to area than any other country, has suffered greatly from the extensive destruction of its forests, but what remains of them is recovering, although slowly, under the better care now bestowed upon them.

Sponge fishing has been extensively carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek islands. By a law passed in 1890 power is given to the High Commissioner to grant exclusive privileges for fishing the coasts for sponges. The value of the fishing may be put at from 20,000£, to 30,000£ a year.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, alcohol, iron, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, copper and iron manufactures; the exports are chiefly corn, cotton, carobs, linseed, madder, olives, silk, raisins, fruit, vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, hides, wines, and spirits, aniseed, flax, sesame, gypsum, terra umbra.
Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council which came into operation on the 1st August, 1882, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign, half-sovereign, Turkish lira, and French 20-franc piece. Silver, the florin, shilling, sixpence, and three-pence, limit of tender 3l. Bronze, the piastre (nine equal to one shilling), half piastre; quarter piastre; limit of tender, 27 piastres.

The Imperial Ottoman Bank has branches or agencies established at Larnaca, Nicosia, Limassol, Famagusta, Papho, and Kyrenia.

There is as yet no Government savings bank.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oke = 2 8 lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum = about ¼ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

There is no railway or navigable waterway in the island, but roads between all important places are now maintained. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration work about 240 miles of land line in connection with their cables. The island is in direct telegraphic communication with Alexandria and Latakia (Syria), by means of the cables of the Eastern and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Companies respectively.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Alexandria, and Smyrna and Constantinople by the “Austrian Lloyd” and “Messageries Maritimes” steamers. There are also frequent direct steamers to and from Egypt and the adjacent coast of Syria.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers. |
|-----------------------------|
| Within the island           | ½ c. p. ½ c.p. per 2 oza. |
| England                     | ” ” ” ” |

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal colonies and foreign countries.

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of efficient schools was established in 1882. The total grant (£3,320.) is divided into two portions, one quarter being shared among the Moslem, and three-quarters among the Christian schools. About 14,346 children enrolled in 1894-95.

A small provision is made for higher or technical education.

Leprosy.

Prior to the British occupation, limited provision was made for lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was originally founded by the dragoman to the Turkish governor early in the century.

The asylum has been greatly improved, several new houses of an improved class having been erected, and the accommodation thus largely increased. The welfare of the inmates has been a matter of considerable attention, and a very nice recreation room was given to them by the late High Commissioner, Sir H. E. Bulwer, which has greatly enhanced the comfort of these poor people.

There is now accommodation for over 100 inmates, and the enclosed farm of 200 donums is partly cultivated by the lepers, the produce being all used on the farm. Each person receives bread, clothing, and fuel, and a government allowance of 2½ copper piastres daily.

No leper quits the farm except on very rare occasions, and then only on urgent business and with the permission of the chief medical officer.

The total number of lepers in the island, as returned by the census of 1891, was 107—76 males and 31 females. On 31st March, 1895, there were 98 inmates of the leper farm.

The disease shows itself in two principal forms, the tubercular, and the anesthetic; of the latter there is a notable sub-group, elephantiasis mutilans, in which spontaneous amputation of fingers, toes, and even whole members occurs. In the other form the skin and mucous membranes are the parts chiefly affected, especially the face and head. This form is more common, more dreadful in its effects, and more rapid in its termination; but neither of the two can be called a fatal disease, as their average duration is 10-20 years, and some lepers live to be quite old people.

Leprosy is slightly more common in this island among males than females; the greater proportion of cases come from low-lying villages in the districts of Famagusta, and cases among Mussulmen are of the greatest rarity. The promulgation of the disease has been proved beyond doubt to be due to contagion, stimulated by unclean habits, bad food, and, in a way, malarial cachexy, although undoubtedly the predisposition to the disease is very often hereditary.

A law was passed in 1891 to better regulate the segregation and treatment of lepers, and a Superintendent has been appointed, who resides in the asylum, to enforce discipline and superintend the conduct of the lepers.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, “in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements,” consented “to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England.” On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:—

“I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkémé-i-Shérîch) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

“II. That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

“III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands let or sold during that period.*

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of £5,000 a year.
IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazi Miriyé vé Emlaki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to legislation has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides or:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment and fine of £l.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to £l.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the Court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkémé-i-Shérif, or Musulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadias, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—
   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.
   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.
   (3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males between 18 and 60 years of age.

3. Tithes of the principal products of the island. (Tithe on cereals taken in kind.)

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (temporary) of \( \frac{1}{2} \) per cent. on tithes and certain incomes (for locust destruction).

9. Import duties.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike. Tithes on grapes and on certain minor articles have been abolished; carobs and silk cocoons pay tithe only on exportation. An export duty of 12 per cent. is charged on raisins; and cotton, linseed, and aniseed pay an export duty in lieu of tithes. All other export duties, and a fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

There is a military police force of about 670 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its mediæval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, of very ancient date, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum was started in 1883 by subscription.

Grants in Aid from Parliament.

| Year     | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| 1884-85  | £15,000|
| 1885-86  | 15,000 |
| 1886-87  | 20,000 |
| 1887-88  | 18,000 |
| 1888-89  | 55,000 |
| 1889-90  | 45,000 |
| 1890-91  | 35,000 |

| 1892-93  | nil    |
| 1893-94  | nil    |
| 1894-95  | 35,000 |

Besides the above a sum of 13,085l. was drawn in 1879-80 out of a vote of 26,000l. exclusively for the support of the "Cyprus Police Augmentation Force," the cost of which was a charge against Imperial funds.

THE NIGER TERRITORIES.

Situation and Boundaries.

These regions, estimated to cover about 500,000 square miles, and with a population estimated at 20,000,000 to 85,000,000, are secured to Great Britain by nearly 400 treaties made by the Royal Niger Company (formerly the National African Company, Limited), and recognized by the three
Anglo-German Agreements of June, 1885; June, 1886, and November, 1893, and the Anglo-French Agreement of August, 1890. The agreements with Germany establish an eastern frontier a line running from the Cross River to a little east of Yola, on the Upper Benue, and thence to a point on the south bank of Lake Chad 35 minutes east of the meridian of Kuka. The northern frontier of the Territories is settled by the agreement with France, and is to be a line drawn from Say, on the Middle Niger, to Barua, on Lake Chad, but diverted so as to leave within the Niger Territories everything that properly belongs to the kingdom of Sokoto. Under this agreement the Company claims the Saharan provinces of Air, or Asben, and Damergu; but this claim is contested by France, and will have to be settled by the International Commission referred to in the agreement. The same commission will settle the western frontier between France and the Niger Territories in the great bend of the Niger to the west of Borgu, a powerful pagan kingdom which was, by a treaty dated the 20th January, 1890, brought within the jurisdiction of the Company. Borgu bounds on the north the kingdom of Dahomey, which France has lately conquered. The Territories are separated from the British colony of Lagos by that portion of Yorubaland which has not yet been conquered by the Mohammedans, nor brought within the jurisdiction of any European power. On the Gulf of Guinea the Territories occupy about 106 miles of coast line from the Forcados to the Brass River; the adjacent coast line on either side falling within the British Niger Coast Protectorate, administered by a British Commissioner and Consul-General, Sir Claude MacDonald, assisted by a number of vice-consuls.

Administration.

The Niger Territories are governed from London by a Council, of which Sir George Goldie is Governor. The Company exercises its jurisdiction under a Royal Charter, dated 10th July, 1896, by which their sovereign rights in the territories over which they have treaties were recognized, and authorized to be exercised.

Order is maintained in the Territories by native allies, by the Company's fleet of twenty to thirty steamers, and by a small force of disciplined troops. These consist of English officers and about 1,000 Hausas, chiefly trained as artillery, but also armed with Snider rifles. There is also a civil police force in each district commanded by the local magistrates. The headquarters of the troops is at Lokoja, at the junction of the Niger and Benue rivers. The capital, where are the supreme court, central gaol, main hospital, and other public institutions, is at Asaba, about half way between Lokoja and Akassa, the mouth of the Niger, on the Gulf of Guinea, which is the transhipping depot, and where are the repairing yards and engineers' works for the fleet of river steamers. A patent slipway—the first in West Africa—has lately been erected at Akassa for the repair of these. The other principal settlements are at Abo, Abutshi, Atani, Bakunudi, Donga, Egga, Ibi, Idah, Leaba, Loko, Odeni, and Yola, the latter being about 200 miles south of Lake Chad.

Climate and Products.

The lower portion of the Territories in the Niger delta has a bad reputation for its climate. In this region are produced the palm oil and palm kernels which form a large portion of the exports from the Territories.

The regions further inland are stated to be much healthier, while their principal products are rubber, hides, ground nuts, shea butter, ivory, chillies, and various drugs.

The chief imports are cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, powder, salt, silks, spirits, and woollen goods. The Company have prohibited the importation of rifles, breech loading guns, cartridges, &c., into any part of the Territories. They have also prohibited the importation of spirits into the upper portions of their territories, and put heavy duties on their introduction into the lower portions, so that the importation of spirits is now less than one-fourth of what it was before the charter. There are no import duties excepting on guns, powder, salt, spirits, and tobacco. The revenue is chiefly raised by export duties.

The revenue and trade of the Company were as follows:

| Years | Revenue | Imports | Exports |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1887  | £42,396 | £73,819 | £228,450 |
| 1888  | £55,771 | £120,878| £230,073 |
| 1889  | £57,652 | £139,465| £260,846 |
| 1890  | £62,430 | £180,692| £286,200 |
| 1891  | £89,667 | £224,729| £335,000 |
| 1892  | £108,155| £181,012| £341,800 |
| 1898  | £110,756| £159,989| £405,986 |

Means of Communication.

There are telegraph stations at Brass and Bonny, in cable communication with Lagos, and thus with Europe. Regular steamers arrive and depart from Liverpool and the West Coast of Africa every three weeks. Communication in the Niger Basin is mainly by the steamers of the Royal Niger Company.
