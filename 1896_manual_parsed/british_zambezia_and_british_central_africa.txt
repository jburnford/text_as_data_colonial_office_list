BRITISH ZAMBEZIA AND BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA.

BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA COMPANY.

Under the unofficial title of British Zambezia, or as it is known locally "Rhodesia," is included the whole of the region lying to the north and west of the South African Republic and the
southern boundaries of the Congo Free State, and having as its eastern and western boundaries the Portuguese and German spheres. The River Zambezi divides it into two portions, which may be described as Zambezia and British Central Africa respectively.

Zambezia.

The western boundary of Zambezia is defined by the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890, the sphere of influence reserved to Germany being bounded (1) by a line from the mouth of the Orange River along the north bank to the point of its intersection by E. long. 20°; (2) from thence along E. long. 20° its intersection by S. lat. 22°, and thence eastward along that parallel to its intersection by E. long. 21°, and following that degree northward to its intersection by S. lat. 18°, it runs eastward along that parallel till it reaches the River Chobe, and descends the centre of the main channel of that river to its junction with the Zambezi, where it terminates.

Its eastern boundary, defined by the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement of the 11th June, 1891, is a line starting from a point opposite the mouth of the River Ángangwa or Loangwa, and running directly southwards as far as S. lat. 16°, follows that parallel to its intersection with E. long. 31°; and thence eastward direct to the point where the River Mazoe is intersected by E. long. 33°; it follows that degree southward to its intersection by S. lat. 18° 30′; thence it follows the upper part of the eastern slope of the Manica Plateau southwards to the centre of the main channel of the Sabi, follows that channel to its confluence with the Lunte, whence it strikes direct to the N.E. point of the frontier of the South African Republic, and follows the eastern frontier of the Republic, and the frontier of Swaziland to the River Maputo.

In tracing the frontier along the slope of the plateau no territory west of E. long 32° 30′ is to be comprised in the Portuguese sphere; and no territory east of E. long. 33° is to be comprised in the British sphere, but if necessary the line is to be deflected so as to leave Mutassa in the British sphere, and Massi-kessi in the Portuguese sphere.

In 1888 the southern region was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

The most important part of this territory is Matabeleland, and including the country around inhabited by the Mashonas, Makalakas, and other tribes. Matabeleland and Mashonaland are rich in gold reefs and other minerals, and the Mashona plateaus are well adapted for culture and European settlement.

The British South Africa Company is further empowered to take over the administration of other districts in Africa, subject to the approval of the Government, including the region to the north and west of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, embracing Khama's territory and the region between that and the German boundary. Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lo Bengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Macloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the southeastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was reached on 12th Sept., 1890. The pioneers were then disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims.

In July last the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's Police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters by the High Commissioner, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's Police and a large force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Buluwayo from the north and east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's force near Buluwayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland Police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lobengula fled, and Buluwayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Changani, and Major Wilson with a small party of men were after a heroic resistance killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country have now been completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambezi, is reported to have died from smallpox or fever.

The country, though desert in parts, is in the main well adapted both for cultivation and agriculture, being situated principally on the high healthy plateau of Central South Africa.

Since the grant of the Royal Charter, the Company has extended the Cape Government Railway System from Kimberley to Vryburg, a distance of 126 miles, and this section has since been taken over by the Cape Government. The Company has also formed the Bechuanaland Railway Company, Limited, to construct a further section from Vryburg to Mafeking, a distance of 98 miles. This was opened for traffic on 3rd October, 1894, and the extension of the line to Gaberones and Palapye is arranged for. It has also extended the telegraph system from Mafeking to Fort Salisbury, in Mashonaland, a distance of over 800 miles. As a consequence of the Matabele Campaign, to which reference is made further on, the extension of the telegraph was carried out from Palapye to Bulawayo, where an office was opened on the 9th July, 1894. This line is now being extended to Charter via Gwelo, a further distance of 212 miles, thus placing Bulawayo in direct communication with Salisbury. It is anticipated that this last extension will be open for traffic before the end of 1894. It is intended to immediately construct a continuation of the telegraph line from Salisbury via Umtali to Chimoio, a distance of about 200 miles, Chimoio being the present terminus of the Beira Railway. Stations have been opened at Mafeking, Ramoutsa, Gaberones, Mochuli, Palla, Palapye, Macloutsie,
Tuli, Nuanetsi, Victoria, Charter, Bulawayo, Mangwe and Salisbury.

At the instance of Mr. Rhodes, the African Transcontinental Telegraph Company, Limited, was incorporated on the 27th December, 1892, with a capital of £140,000, with the object of extending the Company's telegraph system from Salisbury, Mashonaland, across the Zambezi, to Zomba, in Nyasaland, and thence via Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika to Uganda, the ultimate object being to connect with the terminus of the Egyptian Government system of telegraphs at Wady Halfa, placing Cape Town in through communication with Cairo. About 60 miles of line from Blantyre, near Zomba, to Sumbo, in the direction of Tete, was completed on the 26th August last. It is anticipated that the entire section north from Salisbury to Zomba, a total distance of about 400 miles, will be completed in June next, when a further extension of 700 miles to Ujiji, on Lake Tanganyika, will be taken in hand.

A regular postal service has been established, and Mashonaland has recently been admitted into the Postal Union. By the new postal route via Bulawayo, it is possible to communicate by letter between London and Salisbury within 80 to 83 days, of which only 14 are occupied by the journey from Cape Town. The mails also run weekly between Salisbury; Umtali and Beira, in from 8 to 9 days, thus providing a local East Coast service. The coaches running between the various districts afford also transport for both passengers and parcels.

A Company has been formed to construct a railway between Beira, on the east coast, and Mashonaland. The first section of 75 miles was opened for traffic on the 7th October, 1893, and a further extension to Chimdo, being a total railway run of 118 miles, was opened in the latter part of 1894.

A wagon road leads from the present terminus to Salisbury. This railway will prove most valuable in the development of the eastern portion of the country, by affording a cheap and easy means of access both for passengers and machinery.

Regular gold-workings were not commenced until July, 1891. In Mashonaland several distinct goldfields have been discovered, viz. —

| District          | Miles Long | Broad |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Victoria          | 70         | x 20  |
| Manica            | 50         | 14    |
| Hartley Hill      | 40         | 80    |
| Mazoe             | 40         | 80    |
| Lo Mogundas       | 80         | 25    |

Kaiser Wilholm, Concession Hill, &c.

Since the occupation of Matabeleland discoveries of gold-bearing districts have rapidly succeeded each other, finds having been made at Bulawayo, Sebakwe, Gwelo, Matopo, Bembesi, Balingwe, Changuni, Selukwe, Gwanda, etc. On the 7th May, 1894, 7,008 claims were reported as pegged out in Matabeleland.

In addition the following number of claims in Mashonaland had been registered before end of July, 1893:

| Claim            | Number |
|------------------|--------|
| Umfuli           | 8,872  |
| Mazoe            | 6,265  |
| Victoria         | 5,871  |
| Lo Magunda       | 2,875  |
| Salisbury        | 8,290  |
| Manica           | 7,624  |

84,297

In addition to gold, other minerals have been found, and several claims have been pegged off on reefs showing silver, copper, blonde, tin, antimony, arsenic, and lead, while deposits of nitrate of potassium and plumbago, and extensive coalfields, have also been discovered.

Townships have been surveyed and marked out at Salisbury, Victoria, Umtali, Hartley Hill, Bulawayo, and Gwelo. Stands have been sold at the first three places, the amount realized being nearly £18,000. Deputations sent into Mashonaland by Transvaal, Orange Free State, and Cape Colony farmers have reported in very favourable terms on the agricultural prospects of Mashonaland. A "trek" of farmers from the Orange Free State has already entered the country, and others are being organised, and a large number of farms have been allotted under the Company's land laws. In Mashonaland alone by September, 1894, farms representing a total of 1,722,274 acres had been actually surveyed; it was estimated that in Matabeleland 800 farms, aggregating 4,800,000 acres had been beaconed. The white population is estimated at about 8,000.

Printed newspapers are published at Salisbury, Bulawayo and Umtali. Hotels are to be found at frequent intervals along the main roads from Tuli to Salisbury, and from there to Umtali, while at Salisbury itself there are several substantial buildings of brick and iron, offering excellent accommodation. A branch of the Standard Bank has been opened at Salisbury, a Sanitary Board established, government offices and churches built, hospitals erected, and order and good government throughout the country provided for. Immediately upon the occupation of Bulawayo, a settled local government was adopted, with the result that as early as the end of August, 1894, there were 78 brick buildings erected, 61 in course of erection, and a white population of 2,020. An office was opened by the Standard Bank of South Africa.

The Company has from time to time equipped and despatched expeditions into various parts of Central Africa, as the result of which it has secured mining and administrative concessions from many chiefs.

The capital of the Company is 2,000,000L, nearly half of which is represented by cash subscriptions. The Company is already in receipt of revenue from mining, trading, and professional licences, stand holdings, and postal and telegraph services.

BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA.*

The boundaries of this territory, as defined by the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement, are a line starting from the eastern shore of Lake Nyasa at the point of the parallel of the confluence of the Rivers Rovuma and Msinje, and following the

*For most of the information as to this territory, the Editor is indebted to Commissioner Johnston.
shore southwards as far as 13° 30' S. lat., whence it runs S.E. to the eastern shore of Lake Chinta, which it follows; thence in a direct line to the eastern shore of Lake Chilwa, or Shiré, which it follows to its south-easternmost point; thence in a direct line to the easternmost affluent of the River Ruo, and thence along that affluent, and subsequently the centre of the channel of the Ruo to its confluence with the River Shiré.

From the confluence of the Ruo and Shiré the boundary follows the centre of the channel of the latter river to a point just below Chiwanga, and thence due west to the watershed between the Zambezi and the Shiré, and follows the watershed between those rivers, and afterwards between the former river and Lake Nyassa, until it reaches south latitude 14°.

From thence it runs south-west to the point where south latitude 15° meets the River Aroangwa or Loangwa, and follows the mid-channel of that river to its junction with the Zambezi.

On the west the line follows the centre of the channel of the Upper Zambezi, starting from the Katima rapids up to the point where it reaches the territory of the Barute Kingdom. That territory to remain within the British sphere, and its limits to the westward, which will constitute the boundary between the British and Portuguese spheres of influence are to be decided by a joint Anglo-Portuguese Commission.

In the early part of 1891 Her Majesty's Government extended the field of operations of the Company's Charter so as to include the whole of the British sphere north of the Zambezi, except Nyasaland, under which name are included certain districts in the Lake Nyasa region, where British missionaries had been settled for over 15 years, and the African Lakes Company had been at work for the same period, and which in 1889 were declared to be within the British sphere of influence. On 14th May, 1891, the Nyasaland districts were proclaimed as being under the protectorate of Great Britain, their boundaries being thus defined:

On the east and south by the Portuguese dominions, and to the west by a frontier starting on the south from the point where the boundary of the Portuguese dominions is intersected by the boundary of the Conventional Free Trade Zone, defined in the first article of the Berlin Conference Act, following that line northwards to the point where it meets the line of the geographical Congo basin, defined in the same article, and thence along the latter line to the point where it touches the boundary between the British and German spheres defined in the 2nd paragraph of the 1st article of the agreement of the 1st July, 1890.

British Central Africa is divided into the British Central Africa Protectorate, representing the country formerly known as Nyasaland, and the British Sphere of Influence beyond. The first named is administered by the Imperial Commissioner under the directions of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the second by the Commissioner acting for the British South Africa Chartered Company, but to all intents and purposes, however, the administration of the whole of British Central Africa is one at the present time; but in 1896 a change is contemplated by which the Chartered Company will undertake a more direct administration of its own sphere, and at the same time cease to furnish any contribution towards the protectorate police force. All the officials holding office under the Commissioner, while in addition those who exercise magisterial duties hold a commission signed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The whole of the expenses of administering the Protectorate are borne by the Imperial Government, the British South Africa Chartered Company, however, contributes a subsidy towards the police force and the administration of its own sphere, varying according to the annual requirement. For the year 1891, it was 15,000£; for the year 1892, 10,000£; for the year 1893, 17,500£, together with several extra grants for special purposes.

The Commissioner and Consul-General and Mr. Alfred Sharpe, as Consul and Deputy Commr., are wholly paid by the Foreign Office.

The Imperial Government maintains a naval force on the River Zambezi, River Shiré, and on Lake Nyasa, consisting of five gunboats, H.M. ships "Herald," "Mosquito," "Dove," "Adventure," and "Pioneer." There are naval stations at Chinde (the only navigable mouth of the Zambezi); at Tshiroro (River Shiré); at Mpimbi (Upper Shiré); at Fort Johnston and at Fort Maguire (at the entrance to the Shiré and on the south coast of Lake Nyasa). At Tshinde is a small plot of land, known as the "British Concession," specially granted by the Portuguese Government, where all goods in transit for British Central Africa are allowed to be transhipped free of customs duty.

The armed force necessary to maintain order within the Protectorate and the sphere of influence beyond, and to check the slave trade, consists of a corps of 200 Sikhs, seconded from active service in the Indian Army, and allowed to serve in British Central Africa for two years (being relieved by fresh arrivals at the end of that period of service), and also of 200 to 300 black police, consisting of Makua recruited by permission of the Portuguese Government from the vicinity of Mozambique. This force is officered by English officers and Sikh N.C. officers. There is also a good armament of artillery and mountain guns supplied by the Imperial Government.

Communications are maintained between British Central Africa and the sea (the chief "port" being Chiromo at the junction of the Rivers Ruo and Shiré) by H.M. gunboats, and by the river steamers of the African Lakes Company, Sharrot's Zambezi Traffic Company, the African International Flotilla Company, and the British Central Africa administration. These vessels meet at Tshinde with the ocean-going steamers of the Rennie Aberdeen line (London to Natal and Chinde), the German East Africa Steamship Company (whose steamers connect Chinde with Mozambique, Zanzibar, Southampton, and Bombay), and the Portuguese Royal Mail service, and of the Union Steamship Company.

The chief town of British Central Africa is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there is a population of about 100 Europeans and 6,000 natives. Other towns and settlements are:—Zomba (the headquarters of the administration), Chiromo, Katunga, Chikwawa, Mpimbi, Fort Lister, Fort Anderson, and Domasi, all more or less in the Shiré Highlands, or on the River Shiré. Fort Johnston, Fort Maguire, Livingstonia, Bandawe, Likoma, Deep Bay, and Karonga, are on Lake Nyasa; and Fife, Abercorn, Niamkolo, in the Tanganyika District; and Rhodesia and Mysuta on Lake Mweru. A new station is also in process of formation at Johnston Falls on the Upper Luapula River, near Bangweulo, called Fort Rosebery. The Mission settlements on the
Shiré Highlands and on Lake Nyasa have schools attached to them. The chief colonies of Europeans are to be met with at these settlements; the total number of Europeans at present settled in British Central Africa being over 300, of whom about 280 are British subjects.

In the lower part of British Central Africa a few Indian traders have already begun to establish themselves. There are also about 26 Arabs settled on or near Lake Nyasa and Tenganyika, and dwelling there as chiefs recognised by the British government or as merchants of good repute. The native population of the whole of British Central Africa is about 5,000,000, but large portions are devoid of a single human inhabitant owing to the fearful devastation caused in the past by the slave raids of the Arabs and black Portuguese. In fact it may be said that the native population, with the exception of the Barute country (which is thickly populated), is chiefly congregated in that portion of the territory which is more or less under British administration.

The Shiré Province, which is that portion of the Protectorate lying between the south-west, south, and south-east shores of Lake Nyasa and the Zambezi, is now governed very much on the lines of a Crown colony. Good roads are being made in all directions, life and property are safe, and the bulk of the European population is congregated here. This province is remarkable for the extraordinary development of coffee planting which has taken place within the last few years, the coffee grown in the Shiré Highlands being of remarkable excellence. The chief trade on Lake Nyasa is in ivory. Elephants are still very abundant over all British Central Africa, which furnishes probably a fourth of the ivory exported from Africa, though a good deal of it passes into the Portuguese possessions on the Zambezi, the Congo Free State, or German East Africa. Other articles of export are india-rubber, oil seeds, rhinoceros horns, hippopotamus teeth, *strophanthus* seed, bees wax, and rice. The latter article is grown on the shores of Lake Nyasa in great perfection; the Administration has recently introduced the cultivation of wheat, which promises to be very successful. It has also introduced oats and barley, which thrive remarkably on the uplands, and has also made experiments with merino sheep and Natal ponies, both of which kinds of stock seem likely to prosper on the elevated plateau.

The climate on the whole is healthier than the greater part of tropical Africa, but cannot be called salubrious for Europeans in general, chiefly owing to the great discomforts which at present attend a settler's life in an undeveloped country.

A good deal of the sickness seems to arise from the malaria caused by tilling the soil for the first time, and the health records show that as the country becomes opened up it proves much healthier for Europeans than in its virgin state. Curiously enough, most of the complaints arise from cold and not from heat, which is nowhere very excessive, except on one or two days in the height of the summer. On the elevated plateaus and mountain ranges, which represent so large a proportion of the territory, the climate is chilly, especially during the winter months, and fires are burned nearly all the year round in the Europeans' houses.

The attention of capitalists is being directed to the great possibilities of trade on the Zambezi and the waterways connecting it with the lakes.

The total area of the sphere, actual and prospective, of the British South Africa Company south and north of the Zambezi, exceeds 500,000 square miles.

NORTH BORNEO.*

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "the State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with all the islands within a distance of three leagues, including those of Bangney and Balembangan; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 30,709 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 3° 50' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 26th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan (where are also the headquarters of the administration), and Silam on the east, Kudat on the north, Gaya on the west and Mempakol (in Brunei Bay). At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. Inland stations are at Penungah, Papar, and Padas.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, &c.

The mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully investigated. Gold has been found in two of the rivers on the east coast; coal, copper, and other minerals have also been met with, but so far have not been worked.

The country is mountainous, although the shore is flat and fringed with mangrove. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 13,698 feet.

* A scheme for the transfer of this territory to Rajah Brooke of Sarawak was under discussion, but has been negatived by the shareholders of the company.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 200,000, are mainly Malays, Bajows, Dusuns, Sulus and Dyaks, who remove their villages periodically, and live by hunting and plunder, with occasional attempts at planting and trade. There are Malay and Chinese settlements on the coasts, which cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. Sandakan, the chief town, has a population of 7,000. There are two missions, one the Church of England and one Roman Catholic; the former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and the Church of England Community has a church and school at Sandakan, with a branch at Kudat. The club, hotels, banks and insurance agencies, European and Chinese stores, public markets, hospital, Government house, offices, gaol, barracks, saw mills, tennis grounds and the numerous neat suburban bungalows around bespeak civilization and progress.

On the west coast Kudat has also its hotel or rest house, with agencies, stores, shops and bungalows, which supply all the wants of the mixed community.

History.

The state and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1822, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sudakana in 1608, and soon abandoned. An English settlement was made in 1609, and abandoned 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762 at the island of Balembangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and on its failure, the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1840, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded the same district to Mr. Alfred Dent, who transferred it to the British North Borneo Company, and some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the Territory by agreement with "the State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 93°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is about 120 inches, chiefly from November to February.
Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. The chief products are tobacco, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, and pineapple fibre. There is still a large trade in the collection of jungle produce; but during the past year much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco. The soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited for its growth; about 1,000,000 acres have been leased on 999 years leases, or applied for, chiefly for this purpose, and 17 estates are in full operation. The rapid development of this industry is shown by the following figures as to exports of tobacco since 1886:—1886, 72,688 lbs.; 1887, 30,540 lbs.; 1888, 81,664 lbs.; 1889, 168,112 lbs.; 1890, 408,275 lbs.; 1891, 1,635,744 lbs.; 1892, 1,794,720 lbs.; 1893, 1,378,122 lbs.; 1894, 1,411,575 lbs.

The exports comprise also, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, pine-apple fibre, gutta percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), gold, cutch, &c., sent almost entirely to Singapore, China, and Australia; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

A timber trade has been opened with both Australia and China.

The Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import duties, stamps, and royalties on the various exports, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites. Besides the tobacco estates already mentioned four general plantations have been opened by Europeans especially the Dutch, and the demand for land has been so great as to cause the price to be raised during 1889 from $3 to $6 per acre. Pepper and sago are exported from the West Coast. At the end of 1889 four timber companies were engaged in the timber trade, and two saw mill companies are at work carrying on a large export trade with England, China, Manilla, and other ports.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $180,000. American, Mexican, Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, and British dollars are treated as currency. There are agencies of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, and the National Bank of China, and the Company itself does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, and Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a court of directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor, Treasurer-General, and Residents appointed by them. There are 9 provinces (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, and Myburgh).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British colonies, and an Emaum's court, for the administration of Mahomedan law. There is a force of about 300 armed police under European officers. An European medical officer is attached to each residency.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Holt run steamers constantly between Singapore and the local ports, and between Hong Kong and the ports. There is frequent communication by steamer with Singapore and Hong Kong, and occasionally visits are made by steamers running between Hong Kong and Australia. There are no railways, and but few roads. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the postal union. Course of post from London about thirty days. Postage from Sandakan to all places outside the territory, for letters 10 cents per ½ oz.

The postal business has considerably increased during the last few years. Statistics for 1889-93 are as follows:

On the completion of the Singapore—Labuan—Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Menumbok, which has since been joined with Mempakoe by telephone. A telegraph line from that point to Sandakan is now in course of construction.

**Niger Coast Protectorate.**

The British Protectorate of the Niger Coast was formally assumed in July, 1884. It extends along the coast of Africa from the Benin River (where it joins the boundary of Lagos) to the mouth of the Rio del Rey at 9° east longitude. The part between the Forcados River and the Nun mouth of the Niger is claimed by the Royal Niger Company, the remainder forms the “Oil Rivers Niger Coast Protectorate.” The Niger itself is worked exclusively by the river steamers of the Niger Company. The numerous rivers, creeks, and estuaries in this part of the West African coast have received the name of the “Oil Rivers;” from the fact of their producing the bulk of the palm oil which constitutes the chief export of West Africa. They are alleged to be branches of the Niger, and form the delta of that river, but most of them have independent sources. The estuaries of these rivers are connected by a network of more or less navigable creeks, so that with a small expenditure of labour inland navigation might be made practicable from Dahomey to the Cameroons.

Some of the principal of these rivers are: the Benin, an independent river rising in the low range of hills flowing in a deep but tortuous channel through a country of dense forest, but with a shallow and dangerous bar; the Forcados River, the main outlet of the Wari; the Brass River, connected by creeks with the Niger. From the Oguta Lake, which lies a short distance west of the Niger, to the north of Abo, where the delta begins in the rainy season, flow the Opobo River on the east, and the New Calabar River on the west, which enter the sea by the broad estuaries known as the Sombrero, the New Calabar, the Bonny, the Andoni, and the Apoba Rivers, and draining a fertile undulating country, watered by numerous little brooks, and with a rich soil free from marsh, and where cattle appear to thrive.
Further east is the Old Calabar Estuary, mainly formed by the great Cross River, some 400 or 500 miles in length, which drains with its affluents the Old Calabar, Aqua, Akpayafe, and the Ndiana Rivers; the high mountain ranges running north-west from the Cameroon Mountains to the hills round the confluence of the Niger and the Benin.

Communications.

Communication with Europe is maintained by the African and the British and African Steamship Companies, running regularly between Liverpool, Hamburg, Havre, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Sierra Leone, and all the ports in West Africa from Goree to Loanda. They have also a direct line from Liverpool to Old Calabar, calling at Grand Canary, Sierra Leone, Accra, Lagos, and Bonny. The German Woermann line call occasionally on their way to and from the Cameroons, and the steamers of the Compagnie "Chargeurs Rennis" call occasionally at Bonny and Old Calabar. On the Bonny, Brass, Opobo, and Old Calabar Rivers, some of the merchants possess small steamers and launches, which navigate these rivers to some distance inland. The Manchester Steam Navigation Company's boats also call at some of the ports.

The African Direct Cable Company has stations at Brass and Bonny. Akassa is served from Brass, being only 11 miles through the Creeks.

Chief Towns.

Duke Town, on the Old Calabar River, is about 5 miles above its junction with the Cross River, and is the headquarters of Her Majesty's Consular establishment, and the largest and most important town in the Protectorate, containing a population of about 15,000. Two Protestant missions are established there, and have erected schools and churches. Creek Town, 4 miles beyond, is also an important place, population about 5,000.

Near the mouth of the Opobo River is the town of the same name built by Ja Ja, and about 40 or 50 miles inland near the same river is Bende, a great trading centre for slaves and ivory. In the same district is the great fetish town of Aron which is resorted to from all parts of the Niger delta and the Cross River.

Bonny Town, 8 miles from the sea, on the left bank of the Bonny, is a station of the Church Missionary Society, and contains several European establishments. There is also a European settlement at the mouth of the Brass, possessing a very fine church presented by one of the native chiefs. On the Wari branch of the Protectorate there are several populous towns, but the turbulent character of the natives prevents Europeans from resorting to them.

Benin City, some 60 miles up the river of the name, is a large town of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants, the seat of a powerful theocracy of fetish priests, and used to be famous for its human sacrifices. The trading station and Consular establishment in Benin River is situated about 8 miles from the bar, lying open to the sea breeze, though sand flies and mosquitoes abound.

Military posts have been established at Uivet up Calabar River, Itu up Cross River—one establishing at Umvan; Aquettah up Opobo River, Sapole up the Benin River; and from these points advances are being made into the interior.

Climate.

This resembles that of other parts of West Africa, in being deadly for Europeans. The temperature ranges between 65° and 95°, and the rainfall is perhaps the heaviest in the world, there being on the coast no very marked distinction between the dry and rainy seasons. Tornadoes and violent thunderstorms prevail in the spring and late autumn, but do relatively little damage.

Products.

Besides the oil palm (Elais Guineensis), cotton grows above the delta, and the silk cotton tree is found all over the delta, as well as the tree producing the kola nut. The ground nut is widely cultivated in the interior, but not on the coast. Copal gum and other gums are largely produced, and "shea butter," an almost solid vegetable fat produced from the kernels of the seeds of the Butyrospermum Parkii. The castor oil plant is found all over the delta, and the cocoa palm and coffee have been successfully introduced there. Rubber trees abound everywhere, and ebony very largely in the Cross River districts. Elephants abound in numbers in the Akpayafe and Ndiana Rivers, and hippopotami in the Cross River. Considerable coffee plantations are now bearing.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants are typical negroes, and though now divided into several distinct tribes, appear to have had a common origin. Among the most prominent tribes are the Dzekri, occupying the lower part of the Bonn, and closely allied to the Yorubas; the Idzos, occupying the part of the delta east of the Middleton, and south of the Wari and of the Ibo country; the Ibos, occupying the lower Niger just above the delta, and extending to the Cross River, joining the Ukima-Kimas, are an industrious agricultural people, with fine herds of cattle, who create most of the trade of the delta; and the Fikos and "Quas" in the Old Calabar region. The tribes are all more or less cannibalistic, cannibalism being deeply associated with the ceremonial of the old fetish rites, as the "Ju-Ju-Men" or fetish priests are bound at certain times and under certain conditions to eat human flesh. The missionaries have laboured with considerable success to suppress the practice in the towns where they are stationed. Mission stations are situated at Duke Town, Creek Town, Okoyon, on the Old Calabar River, at Ikonotu Creek, Ikwofirty, Ikwana, and Unwana on the Cross River, and also at Ibeno, in the Qua Ibo River.

Trade.

Trade is generally conducted by barter, the native traders purchasing the oil or other produce for European goods, and disposing of it in large quantities to the white trader. The total volume of trade is shown below, the greater part of which is with Great Britain, the remainder with Havre and Hamburg, but carried principally in British ships. Brass rods and Manilla form in some districts the collogue.

Administration.

The native inhabitants are dealt with principally under their own chiefs, there being a native council, presided over by them, subject to appeal to the consular courts. Europeans are subject to the jurisdiction of the consular courts under the West
African Order in Council, with an appeal to the supreme courts of Lagos.

**SARAWAK.**

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 41,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 800,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 380 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan river was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan river to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram river, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1886 another cession was obtained of the Trusan river, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei river. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, and the transfer was approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in August, 1891. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born June, 1829; married 1869, Margaret Alice Lily de Windt), is a nephew of Sir James Brooke, to whom he succeeded in 1868.

Heir, Charles Vyner Brooke (Rajah Muda), born 26th September, 1874.

**Products.**

At Paku in Upper Sarawak a considerable number of Chinese are engaged in working gold, and also in the Batang Lupar Residency. The Borneo Company possesses a monopoly of the mineral rights, other than gold and coal, over most of Sarawak, and at Busoh the Company have extensive antimony works. Coal is mined on a considerable scale at Sadong and Brocketon, the output in 1894 being 26,237 tons, including
the quantity used by the local steamers. There is a considerable export of timber from the Rejang River, mostly to Hong Kong, valued in 1894 at $22,742. There are successful plantations of tea and coffee on Matang, and pepper grows well throughout the Territory. All these articles figure in the list of exports, which also includes diamonds, quicksilver, gutta-percha, india-rubber, canes, rattans, camphor, bees' wax, birds' nests, sago, tapioca, gambier, and silver. The value of the principal exports in 1894 was: Gutta-percha and india-rubber, $248,000; rattans, $236,421; gambier, $152,346; pepper, $240,211; and sago flour, $641,939. In 1884, the quantity of sago flour exported was 97,335 pikuls = 6,800 tons, and in 1893, 272,131 pikuls, or over 1,600 tons. The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 32', E. long. 110° 28'), besides excellent Government offices and Court house, possesses an excellent hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 100 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. It has a native population estimated at 70,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muks, a large town on the Muks River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching or Singapore to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, and Kapit, Baram, Simanggang, Sading Trusan, Limbang.

Communication

Is maintained by the "Rajah Brooke," 768 tons, with Kuching and Singapore every ten days; by the "Vyner," 405 tons, with Sadong, Brooketon, and Singapore every ten days; by the "Adeh," 189 tons, coasting, with trips to Singapore four or five times a year; and by the "Lorna Doone," 54 tons, fortnightly coasting service.

Communication is also kept up with coast stations by Government steam launches.

There are roads only around the capital: internal communication is entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.
