SEYCHELLES.

Situation, Area, and Climate.

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the estimated total number of acres comprised in the group is 50,120.

They are distant from Mauritius 934, from Madagascar 600, and from Zanzibar 970 miles. Mountainous, fairly fertile, and extremely healthy, the shade temperature seldom exceeds 84, and falls frequently at night to 70. The records taken on the hills are several degrees lower. The rainfall at Victoria, Mahé, was:—In 1891, 124 inches; in 1892, 87 inches; in 1893, 88 inches; and in 1894, 95 inches.

Geography.

Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 4 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to contain 45,000 acres.

It rises abruptly from the sea, and its mountains, in some cases, reach the elevation of 2,900 feet. The capital of the island, now called Victoria, is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a safe and commodious harbour.

The other chief islands are Praslin (8,000 acres), Silhouette (5,700 acres), La Digue (2,000 acres), Curieuse (1,000 acres); and Bird, Frigate, Aride, Stag, Felicité, Denis, North, The Sisters, and St. Ann's. The total acreage of the Dependency is estimated to be 95,000 acres.

History.

The Islands are believed to have been discovered by a Portuguese named Pedro Mas Caregna, in 1505, but the discovery was not apparently followed by any attempt at colonization.

Previous to French occupation they were the resort of pirates or corsairs who infested the Indian Ocean, some of whose names are borne by descendants in Mahé at the present time.

Under the Government of Labourdonnais at Mauritius, whose name they originally bore, their position was first defined in 1748, and M. Picault, who took possession of the Islands in the name of the king of France, called the principal island Mahé. Later on the group was re-named the Seychelles Islands, in honour of the Vicomte Hernault de Seychelles.

The natural resources of the Islands, and their freedom from hurricanes, induced the French to transplant from the Isle de France (now Mauritius) cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs, under the directions of M. Poivre. Much secrecy was at first observed in regard to the existence of these retired plantations, the object being to wrest from the Dutch the lucrative spice monopoly which the Colonies of that nation then enjoyed in Europe from their own possessions.

The rumours of the war that broke out between France and England in 1778, induced the then French Governor of Mauritius, Count de Souillac, to issue peremptory orders that in the event of an attack the spice plantations should be at once destroyed. Soon afterwards a French ship from Madagascar, having slaves on board, called at Mahé to take in wood and water, but fearing that the English might be in possession, adopted the ruse of hoisting the English flag. The small French force at Mahé had already been withdrawn, and the officer in charge, knowing that resistance was useless, at once set fire to the whole of the spice trees, each of which had previously been surrounded with dry wood and inflammable material.

During the war of the French Revolution Mahé was extremely useful to French ships as a place of refuge and restment, but on the 17th May, 1794, it was captured by Captain Newcombe, of His Majesty's Ship "Orpheus."

Mr. De Quincy was left in undisturbed possession of his authority, which he had held for twenty years under the French, and subsequently for eighteen years as juge de paix under the British Government.

The capitulation was renewed in 1806 by Capt. Ferrier, of His Majesty's Ship "Albion," and on the capture of Mauritius, Seychelles was formally taken possession of by the appointment of an Agent, and incorporated as a dependency of that Colony.

The increasing importance of these Islands was considered sufficient to warrant an alteration in its constitution, and in December, 1888, an Order in Council was passed creating the office of Administrator, and nominating an Executive and Legislative Council.

An education grant of Rs. 8,000 is annually given in assisting schools of all denominations, of which there were 28 in 1895, attended by 2,178 children. A sum of Rs. 4,000 is also voted for the maintenance of a government undenominational school, and Rs. 1,200 for affiliating two schools to the Royal College of Mauritius.

Communications, &c.

The steamers of the Messageries Maritimes, leaving Marseilles on the 3rd of each month, call at Mahé on the voyages to and from Australia, a third steamer of the same company completing the circuit of the additional line to Mauritius, Réunion, Madagascar, and Zanzibar. The company have a coaling depot there. The British India Company's steamers between Zanzibar and Bombay and vice-versa also call once a month. Men of war of all nationalities frequently call at Mahé. The Admiralty have also a coaling station, and passing steamers can procure coal. It has recently been nominated as the head quarters of the Southern Division of the East India Station. Seychelles is a free port in regard to shipping.

Telegraphic communication with Mauritius and Europe via Zanzibar was completed in November, 1893. The rates for telegrams are 2s. per word to Mauritius or Zanzibar, 3s. 6d. to Aden, and 7s. 3d. to London.

Mails leaving England for Seychelles on the 3rd of each month via Marseilles, and leaving Seychelles for Europe on the 15th or 16th, take from 13 to 15 days in transit.

The present letter rate of postage to the United Kingdom and other countries of the Postal Union is 15 cents, and from the United Kingdom to
Seychelles, 2½d. The parcels post has been in full operation since April, 1890. During the year 1894, 16,246 letters and 22,085 newspapers, books, and samples, and 524 parcels were received from beyond sea, and 21,068 letters and 1,392 newspapers, and 189 parcels despatched. The money order system is in operation with England and numerous other countries and colonies, and since October, 1893, with Bombay and Aden direct.

Savings Bank.

A Government savings bank was established in March, 1894, and towards the close of the year Rs. 16,914 was upon deposit.

Revenue, Trade, Products, &c.

The revenue is derived principally from specific import duties, which are light and an ad valorem duty of 9½ per cent. on articles not otherwise enumerated, licenses, a locally assessed property or income tax and stamps. There is no export duty.

The chief exports consist of cocoa nut oil, coco, vanilla, turtle shell, cloves, cocoa nuts, soap, vacoa bags, &c.

More especially at Praslin, though also in other parts of the group, are to be found the celebrated cocos-de-mer, with the leaves of which beautiful hats and delicate basket work are made by the natives.

The Aldabra group of islands under the Seychelles administration is the habitat of the gigantic land tortoises; numerous living specimens are however to be seen in Mahé and the neighbouring islands.

The lighthouse is situated on Denis Island, and the quarantine station is placed on Long Island opposite to Mahé.
