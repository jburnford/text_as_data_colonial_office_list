GIBRALTAR.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat. 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long high mountain called "The Rock," and a very flat sandy plain to the north of it raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, and called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,439 feet, its length is 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¾ of a mile. Its area is 1½ square miles.
History.

The rock of Gibraltar, the Mons Calpe of the ancients, remained under the dominion of the Moors until the 15th century, when it was incorporated with the Spanish kingdom of Granada. It was captured by the British forces under Sir George Rooke, 24th July, 1704, and was ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It was successfully defended by Gen. Eliot (afterwards Lord Heathfield) in the great siege of 1779-1783.

General Description.

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called the Bay of Gibraltar, which is about 4 or 5 miles across, and affords good anchorage for the shipping passing through the straits. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock are an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea and the sandy plain known as the North Front, which lies between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Linea; from the northern end the Rock runs along southward like a knife edge to the ancient site of O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind these latter lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only ½ by ¼ mile. It is one of the most thickly inhabited places in the world, but it is not unhealthy, though the drainage and water supply are still defective. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden, called the Alameda. The civil population in the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south-east of the New Mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being entirely taken up with barracks, hospitals, &c., for the Military and the Navy.

Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and coaling station by shipping, and it is also an entrepôt of the trade between England and the Arabian states of Northern Africa, for which it has many advantages, having been ever since its occupation by the British a free port. About 450 persons are employed in tobacco manufactories, and about 1,200 in the coal depots. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1894, 35 vessels, of together 6,446 tons. No statistics of imports or exports are taken, but in 1894, the exports from England to Gibraltar were 598,111 pesetas, and the imports 43,112 pesetas.

The revenue is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, duties upon wine, spirits, and beer, and a few licence duties.

There is no executive council nor any legislative body. The Governor, who is also the General commanding the garrison, exercises by himself all the functions of government and legislation. The management of the drainage, water supply, &c., is in the hands of a nominated body, called the Sanitary Commissioners. Their receipts for 1894 were 827,625 pesetas, and their expenditure 758,875 pesetas, and their debt on the 31st of Dec., 1894, 1,305,000 pesetas.

There is a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, which has taken over the business of the late Mr. J. Saccone.

A Government savings bank was founded in 1882, and had on 31st Dec., 1894, 4,007,366 pesetas deposited by 3,406 depositors. The legal tender currency is that of Spain, and public accounts are kept in it: (1 peseta = 1 franc, approximately).

There is daily postal communication with England by way of Spain and France. Rates of postage: letters 2½c. per ½ oz., newspapers 10c. The internal postage rate is 10c. per ½ oz. There are also branch post offices worked by the Gibraltar postal administration at Tangier, Tetuan, Larache, Rabat, Casablanca, Safi, Mazagan Mogador and Fez in Morocco, and direct telegraphic communication with Spain, and by cables to Tangier, Malta, Lisbon, and Cadiz.

Education is not compulsory. There are fourteen elementary poor schools subsidised by Government, the number of scholars on the rolls being 1,811 in 1894. The schools are managed by the clergy of the different denominations, and small fees are charged.

Defence.

As an important naval station, Gibraltar is strongly fortified, the whole area forming one large citadel. There is a permanent garrison of about 5,000 men. The naval establishment numbers at present about 250, but is being increased. The Admiralty are constructing large dry docks, and works to provide an enclosed harbour are being rapidly pushed forward.
