CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of
Longitude 22° by the Orange River, on the northeast by the Orange Free State and Natal, and on the east by Pondoland. The Cape Colony with the Transkei contains an area of 221,311 square miles, being over four times that of England. It extends from 28 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876 three large tracts of Kaffirland—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walvisch Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the colony by proclamation dated 7th Aug., 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 18 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tombuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvaneland, and Gcalekaland, of which by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed governor. By Proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayllif") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of —October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Basutoland, now an independent colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the "Haarlem," was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British Force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III, c. 11) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonization as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of 50,000l. to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonization of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:

1. General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question.
2. Particular resentment against the policy of Lord
Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. 8. Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat never oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice are unknown except in the more elevated localities. The mean temperature at Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is—maximum 71°4, minimum 53°1, and average rainfall for last 7 years 30-12 inches. Aliwal N. (4,330 ft. above sea), shows 73-6 and 43-6 max. and min. resp., rainfall average for 7 years 26 inches.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (Nov. to Apr.), in the Western districts during the winter months.

Diseases of the lungs are rare, and there is a remarkable exemption from cholera, fevers, &c.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Railways.

The railways of the Colony consisted originally of three separate systems, the Western, Midland, and Eastern, having their starting points on the sea-board at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London respectively. The Western and Midland systems are connected by a junction at De Aar (500 miles from Capetown and 340 from Port Elizabeth) and carried forward thence as one trunk line to Kimberley, the centre of the Diamond Fields (647 miles from Capetown and 485 from Port Elizabeth). This line was opened in 1885. From Kimberley the line is now carried Northward to Mafeking in British Bechuanaland; a further northward extension, towards Mashonaland and Zambesi is in contemplation. The extension from Colesberg to Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State (140 miles), was opened for traffic to Bloemfontein in December, 1890. Since that date the line has been carried through the Free State, over the Vaal River into the Transvaal territory. The line through the Free State to the Vaal River belongs to and is worked by the Cape Government as part of their railways; from the Vaal River the Cape Government trains by virtue of a convention run through to Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Eastern system extends from East London, through Queen's Town, to Aliwal North, adjacent to the Basutoland and Orange Free State frontiers, was opened in 1885, and in February, 1892, it was extended to join the Cape Government railway within the Free State at Springfontein, so forming a direct line to Bloemfontein and Johannesburg. A branch extends to King William's Town, 42 miles from East London.

The lengths from Cape Town to Wellington 45 miles, and from Cape Town to Wynberg, 8 miles, became the property of the Government by purchase; the rest have been constructed, equipped, and maintained at the expense of the general revenue.

The Government mileage open for traffic in December, 1894, was 2,253 miles; the capital expended on purchase, construction, and equipment to that date being £20,092,300L. The gross receipts for 1894 were £2,713,753L, compared with £2,559,542L. In 1893; the working expenses were £1,483,771L, compared with £1,510,946L in 1893, resulting in a return of 5L. 6s. 5d. per cent. on capital expended.

The line between Grahamstown and Port Alfred (about 43 miles), which was constructed by a company subsidised by Government, was opened for traffic in 1883. During the session of 1883 powers were given to a company, to be also aided by a subsidy, to construct a branch from Worcester, on the Western Main Line, down the Breede River Valley as far as Montagu. This line is now open past Robertson to Ashton, about 42 miles.

During the session of 1895 the Colonial Legislature authorized the construction of the following lines by private enterprise, the Government subsidizing the Companies, Concessionaires, or Contractors building the lines, viz.:

(1.) A line of railway from Mossel Bay, via George, Oudtshoorn, and Willowmore, to a point on the Graaff Reinet Railway, at or near Klipplaat;

(2.) A line of railway from a point at or near Somerset East, via Cookhouse and Bedford, to Fort Beaufort;

(3.) A line of railway from Fort Beaufort, via Alice, to King William's Town;

(4.) A line of railway from Graaff Reinet, via Middelburg, to Middelburg Road.

It was further decided that the Government should construct, equip, and work the lines from Oudtshoorn, via Willowmore, to a point on the Cape Government Railways at or near Klipplaat, and from Graaff Reinet, via Middelburg, to Middelburg Road, in the event of the same not being undertaken by private enterprise, on the terms offered by Government.

The Cape Copper Mining Company own and work a mineral line from Port Nolloth to Ookiep (92 miles) in the north-western part of the Colony, built at a cost of £158,000. In September, 1892, a line of railway 3½ miles long was opened for passenger traffic between Cape Town and Sea Point; it belongs to a private company. In the same year a private line of 7 miles in length was opened, connecting the Zwartkop Salt Pan with the Midland (Government) Railway System. Total railways open, 2,441 miles.
Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale are being constructed at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London, under the direction of local boards, composed of elective and nominee members.

The expenditure upon construction of works at Table Bay to the 30th June, 1895, has been £2,117,492.1., and on maintenance and interest on loans £85,857.1. and £44,121.1., respectively.

The breakwater is now carried out to a length of 3,640 feet. The graving dock was opened for use in 1882. Its length is 539 feet, and it is capable of taking vessels of the largest class likely to visit these waters. It is constructed throughout of colonial granite.

Extensive additions to the shipping accommodation have been authorised, and are in course of construction, comprising an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater, and a south arm running parallel with it, which will enclose an area of 64 acres, in addition to the inner docks, or a total area, when the works are completed, of about 75 acres, with a depth ranging from 24 to 36 feet at low water.

The works constructed at Port Elizabeth were two iron pilo jetties, 1,152 and 840 feet long respectively, which have much facilitated the landing and shipping of passengers and goods; an iron bridge over the Baakens River, and two retaining banks, and the removal of the old wooden jetties, and the old breakwater and shield. The net expenditure from 1st Jan., 1878 to the 30th June, 1893 was £320,625.1.* The work of extending the north jetty, at a cost of £100,000.1., is completed.

The administration of the harbour is in the hands of a board of seven members, three elected by residents paying 10l. a year wharfage, one nominated by the Chamber of Commerce, two by the Government, and the Mayor being a member ex officio.

At East London and at Port Alfred, at the mouths of the Buffalo and Kowie Rivers, the attempt made to overcome the obstructions of the sand-bars which close the entrances, by the construction of training-walls intended to have the effect of removing the bar by the natural scouring of the stream, has resulted in regard to the former in increased depth of water and general improvement. Two steam pump hopper dredgers are now employed at East London, with highly satisfactory results in opening the entrance channel. To the 31st July, 1895, there had been expended at East London for works and interest on loans, £95,620.10s. 11d., and at Port Alfred £741,363.1.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin, nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the Mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The River Diggings, which still support a population of between 3,000 and 4,000, extend along the Vaal River, principally on the right bank from above Hebron to its junction with the Hart at Delport's Hope. The Dry Mines at present worked are at Kimberley, De Reers, Du Toits Pan, and Bulfontein. St. Augustine's Mine also figures to a small extent in the production returns.

The following tables give the total quantity and value of the production and export of Diamonds during the past five years:

| Year | Production (Carats) | Exports (Carats) |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 1890 | 2,443,777           | 2,504,728        |
| 1891 | 2,880,308           | 2,355,645        |
| 1892 | 2,968,375           | 3,039,062        |
| 1893 | 2,899,474           | 2,758,827        |
| 1894 | 2,809,078           | 2,607,409        |

Minerals, &c.

Cape coal from various mines situated in the Stormbergan is now extensively used upon the Eastern system of railways, with good results both as regards the working of the line, and the development of an industry likely to prove of the greatest benefit to the Colony. The use of the coal is at present confined to the Eastern system, but a junction line joining the Midland system at Middelburg Road has been constructed from a point a few miles south of Burghersdrop, with the object of providing ready access to the coal for the other systems when circumstances render possible its more extended employment. A good class of coal is procured from the Indwe mine situated in the district of Wodehouse, and small supplies have been drawn from this source at various times. The cost of transport, however, by wagon in the absence of railway connection has rendered its adoption on
a large scale impossible up to the present time. By Act of Parliament certain persons who have devoted considerable attention to the development of this mine, are authorised under specified conditions to construct the required line, receiving in exchange grants of land and money, and the survey is now being proceeded with. The coal from both the Stormberg and the Indwe mines is used locally for domestic purposes and for mill furnaces, &c. The output from the mines during 1894 is returned at 69,690 tons.

In the neighbourhood of the Indwe, trending in a north-east direction, are considerable tracts of Crown land as yet untested, but reported by mining and geological experts to be in all probability the seat of valuable deposits of coal. It has been suggested that these beds may be connected with those found on the north-west border of Natal.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist.

The output from the mines during 1894 was 34,281 tons of ore, the quantity exported being 27,077 tons, valued at 284,800L.

Guano is found in large quantities on the various islets along the coast; the industry is under government control.

**Industries.**

The chief industries are the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of the Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked. Those reserved to the Crown cover an estimated area of about 250,000 acres. They are controlled by the Department of Agriculture, at an annual charge of some 22,000L. The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests with anticipated satisfactory results.

The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, gold, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are textiles, leather, sugar, coffee, hardware, explosives, and machinery.

The wine exported in 1894 amounted to 83,132 gallons, valued at 18,908L.

Ostrich breeding is not now carried on so largely as heretofore. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in many districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1894 it amounted to 350,404 lbs.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—385 lbs., 403,158 lbs., and 10,003,173 lbs. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871, and stood at 54,540,787 lbs. in 1894.

The Agricultural Department, which was established in 1887, has, by the consent of Parliament, been placed under a separate Minister. Amongst the more important works of the past few years have been the reconstitution of the phylloxerised vineyards by means of the French American resistant stocks, the improvement in the Hackney breed of horses, the establishment of a Bacteriological Laboratory for investigating diseases of animals, and for ensuring the supply of calf lymph for purposes of vaccination, the cultivation of tobacco, and the preparation of raisins and fresh and dried fruits for export purposes. A general Scab Act, passed during the session 1894, came into force in November, 1896, and repealed the existing permissive Acts. The Game Laws are also administered by the department, and an attempt to acclimatise trout is meeting with considerable success. Oysters have lately been laid down in the Zwartkops River, near Port Elizabeth. There are Agricultural schools in connection with the Department at Stellenbosch and Somerset East.

Capetown, East London, and Port Elizabeth are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1894, 29 vessels registered, of together 8,431 tons.

The following return supplied by establishments producing manufactures of the value of 100L or upwards per annum, showed the value and importance of the various industries of the colony in 1890:

| Class of Industry | Value of Articles produced | Number of Workers | Value of Materials | Value of Builders, Machinery, Labor, &c. |
|------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Food, drinks, and stimulants | 2,148,961 | 3,931 | 1,588,001 | 916,248 |

| Grand total | 9,238,870 | 32,735 | 4,111,912 | 13,001,860 |

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account.

Since the beginning of 1892, the banks having their head offices outside the colony are only allowed to issue notes supplied to them by the government, which holds securities deposited by the institutions for the total supply of such notes given to the banks. The notes are legal tender and guaranteed by the government, the banks having to redeem the notes in gold on demand at their chief places of business.

Banks having their head office in the colony, and having been registered on the 1st January, 1891, can continue to issue their own notes, which are neither guaranteed nor legal tender.

There are 5 banks with 81 branches.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (56 branches), the Bank of Africa, Limited (11 branches), the African Banking Corporation, Limited (14 branches), the Stellenbosch District Bank, Limited, and the National Bank, S.A. Rep.

The total amount of notes in circulation on the 30th of June, 1895, was 563,477L.
Post Office savings banks were established in 1884; on 30th June, 1895, there was 1,441,065l. deposited, to the credit of 41,450 depositors. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. on certificates and 8½ per cent. on deposits.

Number of branches 238.

The weights and measures in use are British; besides which there are the Morgen=2½ acres, the Cape Foot=1.03 feet, and the Cape ton=2,000 lbs.

Education.

Under the Education Act, No. 18 of 1865, and the Higher Education Act, No. 24 of 1874, the department administers, parliamentary grants to colleges, and to the following classes of schools, viz.:—undenominational public, district boarding, evening, private farm, poor, mission, aborigines', aborigines' institutions, and special institutions, such as art schools and a normal college, for the following purposes, viz.: Part payment of salaries, purchase of buildings, furniture, apparatus, and books; training of teachers; support of indigent boarders.

Schools are managed and teachers appointed, subject to the control of the department, by local committees or managers nominated by the voluntary promoters and supporters of the schools, or by divisional or municipal councils acting as such managers.

The Government grants are, generally speaking, given to supplement local contributions of at least equal amount. There is no school tax, the necessary grants being provided from the general revenue. The department further undertakes the periodical inspection of schools, collects and publishes educational statistics, and issues certificates of professional competency to teachers.

The Government expenditure on schools in 1893-94 was 175,890l. 9s. 3d. On the 30th of June, 1895, there were in operation five colleges with 378 students and 2,195 schools of various classes, with an enrolment of 107,318, and an average attendance of 79,441.

The University.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowment, &c. The Council consists of 20 members.

In 1891 the number of students who matriculated was 142, 35 passed the intermediate examination, and 16 took direct degrees. In 1892 the numbers were 207, 40, and 19; in 1893, 214, 40, and 24; in 1894, 214, 37, and 28; in 1895, 242, 43, and 25 respectively.

In connection with the University, school examinations are held annually. 12,331 candidates have passed the elementary, and 2,888 the higher examinations during the years 1875-1895.

Sea and Land Communications.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Capetown, by the Western cable, and via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable. The telegraph system is well developed, there being now 14,831 miles of telegraph wire, and 386 miles of telephone wires open, erected by the Government at a cost of 458,000l.; the gross earnings in 1894 being 159,388l., and the expenditure 82,910l.

The packets of the Union Steam Ship Company and the Castle Mail Packets Company, under contracts with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 19 days, and in 19½ days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena. The average passage is under 18 days. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. Up to the 20th June, 1891, the mail packets called at Lisbon on outward voyages to take up the supplementary English and the Continental mails; but after that date it was arranged that they should call at Madeira only on the direct outward voyage, the Lisbon service as well as the St. Helena-Ascension service being performed by the intermediate steamers of the two companies. The mail packets call at Madeira on the homeward voyages.

Steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal calling at Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and East London, to land and embark passengers; and usually leave about 48 hours after the arrival of the English mail.

A "limited mail train" is despatched from Cape Town conveying mails to all parts of the Colony, about five or six hours after the arrival of the English mail steamer, the mails for the Transvaal, Orange Free State, Bechuanaland Protectorate, and Rhodesia, Mashonaland, etc., being despatched only at 9 p.m. daily by train, and the Natal mails are sent overland by this train or the limited mail trains to connect with a steamer at East London.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A "Castle" Company's steamer leaves Natal once a fortnight for Delagoa Bay, and every four weeks for Mauritius and Madagascar. The "Union" Company extend their Natal service to Delagoa Bay once every fortnight. Monthly communication is maintained with East Coast ports north of Delagoa Bay by means of the German East Africa Company's steamers sailing from Natal, and there is a fortnightly service between Cape Town and the Australasian Colonies performed by the steamers of the Shaw, Saville and Albion, and the New Zealand Shipping Company.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily; with Natal daily, via the South African Republic; with the Orange Free State daily, with Rhodesia (Mashonaland, etc.) twice a week via Mafeking, and with the Transvaal daily by rail through the Orange Free State. The latter is the direct route to the Transvaal, and the journey from Cape Town is performed in little more than two days.

Transit between England and Johannesburg and Pretoria by this route is, therefore, about 20 days.

Overland communication is effected by rail through Cape Town and Delagoa Bay daily, through the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The journey is performed in four days.

The number of Colonial post offices is 797, and of money order offices 227. The expenditure on the postal service amounted to 197,206l. in 1893; the revenue was 197,947l., and the commission on money orders 11,603l.
Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1891 the total population of the Colony was found to be 1,527,224, comprising 767,827 males, and 759,897 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 876,987; Malays, 13,907; Hottentots, 50,888; Fingoes, 229,680; Kaffirs, 608,456; and other coloured persons, 247,806.

Cape Town, which had in 1875 a population of 88,289, had at the census a population of 51,261, and with its suburbs, connected by rail and tramway, 83,898, as compared with 50,259 in 1875. The Cape division, which includes Cape Town, had in 1865, a population of 50,064; in 1875, 57,819; and in 1891, 97,288, of which 48,544 were European and white.

The population of the other principal towns was: Kimberley, 28,718; Port Elizabeth, 23,266; Beaconfield, 10,498; Grahamstown, 10,498; Paarl, 7,668; King Williams Town, 7,226; East London, 6,924; Graaff Reinet, 5,946; Worcester 5,404; Uitenhage, 5,831; Cradock, 4,889; Oudtshoorn, 4,386; Queenstown, 4,094; Stellenbosch, 3,462; and Somerset East, 2,894.

The following is a brief abstract of the 1891 census returns:

The number of persons of European descent has been estimated as follows:—Dutch and French origin, 230,000; English, Scotch, Irish, &c., 180,000; other Europeans, 16,000.

The European, or white, then represents one-quarter, and the coloured races three quarters of the total population of the whole colony, whereof one-fifth is urban. The proportion of females is now 99-03 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 6-50. The number of inhabited dwellings was 276,807, of which 522 were not intended for dwelling houses, though used as such.

Birthplaces.—1,472,996 persons had Africa for a birthplace, 49,849 Europe, 2,844 Asia, 988 America, 890 Australasia, 155 were born at sea, and the birthplaces of 502 were unknown or unspecified. About 98-12 per cent. of the population are British subjects.

Religions.—Protestants numbered 782,047; Catholics, 17,275; Jews, 8,009; Mohammedans, 15,099; other sects, 1,394; no denomination, 638; no religion, 758,824; unspecified, 3,277; and 661 persons objected to state their religion. Protestants may be divided as follows:—Dutch Reformed Church, 297,983; Gereformeerde Kerk, 8,837; English Church, 189,058; Presbyterians, 37,102; Independents, 69,692; Methodists, 111,522; other Protestants include, inter alia, 51,557 German Lutherans.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact
Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

There is a Legislative Council of 22 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 76 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony, including the Transkeian territories. The Colonial Ministers are the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Public Works, and the Secretary for Agriculture, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. The session lasts usually from May to August.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act 39 of 1877, a Member is added to the Council for that province. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of £2,000., or movable property worth £4,000. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act of 1892) by possession of property worth £75., or receipt of salary or wages of not less than £50. per annum; but no one can be newly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation. The number of registered electors in 1893-4 was 91,875. The Registration Act No. 41 of 1887 makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy.

Elections are now conducted under the Ballot Act.

Members of either house are paid one guinea per day, with 15s. per day extra for not more than 90 days if residing over 15 miles from Capetown. Speeches may be made either in English or in Dutch (Law No. 1 of 1882).

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The supreme court, as consolidated by Act No. 40, of 1882, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puisne Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall the territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, and Tembuland.

The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold Sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold Sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and Transkei, and the Judges of the High Court holds session at Kimberley.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. A "Native Territories Penal Code" came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John's on 1st January, 1887.

By Act No. 3 of 1890, the Supreme Court has been constituted a Court of Appeal under the Africa Order in Council of 1889.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of eight elective members exclusive of the Civil Commissioner who is usually also Resident Magistrate as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns ten members. The electors are the registered parliamentary voters, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not not less than £500. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they have also important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; may promote the establishment of a Divisional Police Force, on payment to Government of one-third of the cost of such force; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and roadrates. They were 72 in number in 1893, and their receipts during the year 1894 amounted to £79,611., of which £10,973. was money borrowed for public works. Payments for the same period amounted to £174,264. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an ordinance in 1886. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of which are elected annually by the ratepayers. Town councils or municipalities have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £, on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value, excepting in Capetown, where a landlord's rate of 3d. may be levied.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There were 86 municipalities in the Colony, whose receipts from all sources during the year 1894 amounted to £799,584., which includes £427,301. loans raised and repaid. Payments during the same period amounted to £48,302. The Controller and Auditor-General has no control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 75 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 8 members elected annually by the voters registered for
Parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1893-94 to £5,734l.

Defence.

There is an extensive Admiralty establishment and several forts at Simon's Bay, and to defend this Naval station an Imperial garrison is stationed at Cape Town and Wynberg. The defence of the Colony from native attacks, however, devolves since 1871 upon the Colonial forces. These now consist of the Cape Mounted Rifles (838 strong) and the Cape Police (1,169 strong), liable in an emergency, which are permanently embodied and paid. There are also 45 Volunteer Corps, of all arms, numbering 5,971 men (with 12 guns), maintained by a capitation grant. Table Bay has been strongly fortified at the joint expense of the War Office and the Colonial Government.

Dependent Territories.

Basutoland, which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa, who also holds the office of Governor of the Cape Colony. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of British Bechuanaland, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under those headings.

The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amaxosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government, and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Colonel C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885 the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas, Pali, chief of the Amatsezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pondomai tribe, under the chiefs Umditshwa and Umhlonhlo, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1882.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Ponds, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigceau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigceau and Nquiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule, and Magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5, of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Nquiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000l.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now subject to Colonial rule, and had a revenue of £81,830l. in 1892-93, and an expenditure of £98,646l. in 1892-93; all of this is included in the ordinary Colonial revenue.

They are now re-grouped, under two Chief Magistrates, with several subordinate magistrates, in the following manner, viz.:

Griqualand East, including East Pondoland, under one Chief Magistrate, Mr. W. E. Stanford, C.M.G., and twelve subordinate magistrates. It had (excluding East Pondoland) a population of 4,150 Europeans and 148,468 natives in 1891, at census date.
Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvansland, Emigrant Tembuland, and West Pondoland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Major Elliot, C.M.G., and nine subordinate magistrates. It had (excluding West Pondoland) a population of 5,179 Europeans and 175,236 natives, including Port St. John's in 1891.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, all under the Chief Magistrate of Tembuland, and six subordinate magistrates. It had a population of 1,019 Europeans and 152,544 natives in 1891.
