Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,876 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

Physical Features.

The coast line, extending for a distance of about 3,000 miles, is indented by a certain number of bays, creeks, and harbours, and in the northern parts fringed by numerous islands. In the south there are three separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The loftiest range in the Southern District is the Stanley Range, the highest point of which is about 3,420 feet. The principal other ranges are known as the Blackwood, Darling, and Roe; these, with the exception of Mount William, in the Murray District, 8,000 feet high, do not reach greater altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea. In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the Leopold and the Mueller ranges the highest point in the latter attaining about 2,300 feet. The settled districts are usually level or undulating, rarely mountainous. The western seaboard is comparatively flat, of a sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation. To the eastward of the Darling range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character, and improves as you proceed inland. The north and north-eastern parts of the Colony contain a large area of good pastoral country, suitable also in some parts for the growth of tropical products, such as sugar and coffee.

The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the north, to Point d'Entrecasteaux in the south, a distance of about 800 miles.

Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this range, and flow into the sea to the westward.

The principal rivers of the Colony are the Ord, Prince Regent, Panton, Fitzroy, De Grey, Harding, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoyne, Murchison, Greenough, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Preston, Blackwood, Warren, Pallinup, and Gordon. Most of these are mere storm-water channels filled only during the rainy season, and very few of them are navigable even for boats for any distance.

Lakes.

The lake district may be considered to be confined to the westward of the Darling range; within this area there are numerous salt and fresh water lakes and lagoons—but many of them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.

Numerous islands and islets occur along the coast-line. Dirk Hartog Island, in Sharks Bay, is the largest of those used for pastoral purposes, whilst guano is found on the islands comprised in Houtman's Abrolhos, the Lacedepes, and various other islands on the north-west coast.

History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1828 Captain Gilbert, R.N., in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and in June, 1829, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1850, the Colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution was what is called "Representative," established by Act 33 Victoria, No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The legislature consists of two houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 21 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 33 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The Colony is divided into 7 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the Colony for at least 2 years; (3) a natural born subject of Her Majesty or naturalized for 5 years, and a resident in the Colony during that period.
Qualification of Elector.—(1) Each elector must be of at least 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity; (2) a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, resident in the Colony for 12 months, or a denizen of Western Australia; (3) have possessed for at least 1 year before being registered, and within the electoral province for which he seeks to be registered: (a) either a freehold estate of the clear value of 100l. above all charges or encumbrances affecting the same; or (b) have been a householder for the last preceding 12 months, the dwelling house being of the clear annual value of 25l.; or (c) holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 25l., the lease having 18 months to run; or (d) holder of a leasehold, for the last preceding 18 months, of the annual value of 25l.; or (e) holder of a lease or license from the Crown at an annual rental of at least 10l.; or (f) have his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Boards in respect of property in the province of the annual rateable value of 25l.

Legislative Assembly.—There are 33 electorates for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by a single member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 4 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the Colony for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the Queen, or shall have been naturalized for 5 years, and shall have resided in the Colony for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Any man of the age of 21 years being a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and not subject to any legal incapacity, who shall have resided in the Colony for at least 12 months if he (1) is resident in the district at the time of making his claim and during the previous 6 months; or (2) has a freehold estate in the district of the clear value of 50l. above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same for 6 months next before the time of making the claim; or (3) is a householder for the last preceding 6 months, the house or premises being of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (4) is the holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l., the lease of which has 18 months to run; or (5) is a holder for the last preceding 18 months of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (6) is the holder for the last preceding 6 months of a lease or licence of Crown Lands at an annual rental of 5l.; or (7) has his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Boards in respect of property within the district.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Colonial Treasurer (also Colonial Secretary), the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Director of Public Works (also Commissioner of Railways), and the Minister for Mines and Education.

Local Government.

Under Act 40 Vict., No. 13, as amended by 42 Vict., No. 16, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Perth, Fremantle, Albany, Geraldton, Bunbury, Busselton, Guildford, York, Newcastle, Northam, Roebourne, Cossack, Beverley, Cue, Coolgardie, Day Dawn, Gingin, Carnarvon, and Southern Cross. The municipal councils, with the exception of the last seven, which are presided over by a chairman, consist of a mayor and councillors—the mayor and chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. Under "The Water Works Act, 1889" (53 Vic. 13), the Perth City Council is authorized to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £; also under "The Public Health Act, 1886," Councils of Municipalities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 3d. in the £; 25,919l. was granted in 1894 to district roads boards (of which there are 59) and municipal councils (19) for the repair and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the Colony.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the Colony at the 31st December, 1894, was estimated to be 82,072, consisting of 55,072 males, and 27,050 females, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese was 1,320, of whom 1,313 were males and only 7 females.

The chief towns are Perth (15,703), Fremantle (9,500), Albany (3,000), Geraldton (1,500), York (1,900), Bunbury (800), and Guildford.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the Colony, 5,923,946 acres only have been alienated, while 88,128,993 acres are leased for pastoral, and 2,087,407 for other purposes. No less than 528,420,294 acres are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 3,000 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, three hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley and Eucla districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes, but Geraldton is the centre of a fertile and flourishing agricultural district. In the south-west corner of the Colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the Colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total cultivated area is 193,197 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.
Industry.

The principal industry, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,132,311) are depastured in all parts of the Colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1894, principally to London, was 9,432,876 lbs, which, at 6d. per lb., is valued at £22,201. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1894 was valued at £74,804l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore and China, to the extent of about £28,430l. during 1894.

At Sharks Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounted to £62,805l. in 1894.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but for the last few years little work has been done in them, owing to the fall in the value of these metals. The prospects in copper are, however, improving.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

There are now (30th June, 1895) eleven goldfields in existence:—Kimberley, Pilbara, Ashburton, Murchison, East Murchison, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, and Dundas, and a large population continually employed in searching for, and extracting, precious metals.

Much machinery is now in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a great future before them, judging from the steady increase both in returns and population. The value of gold exported up to the end of 1894 was £1,728,423/19s. 4½d. The gold export during 1894 was £787,099l.

There is also evidence of the existence of good coal both in the south-west corner of the Colony and in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood River, and this export appears for 1894 as valued at £15,274l. There is little doubt that a fairly rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in very small quantities, near Perth.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Australasia.

The average amount of their deposits for the year ending the 31st December, 1894, was £1,808,562l., and their note circulation £143,156l.

A Government Post Office saving bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863, and the deposits during the year, ended 30th June, 1894, amounted to £146,388l.

The establishment of a branch of the Royal Mint at Perth is in contemplation.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are under the supervision of the Minister of Education, assisted by elected district boards. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (35 Vict., No. 14), and are enforced.

Assisted schools of different denominations are also subsidised by the State. The amount expended on education for 1894 was £18,270l., on school buildings £10,643l. A high school is also subsidised by the State.

In January, 1894, there were 116 Government schools in the Colony, with 5,037 scholars on the rolls, and 21 assisted schools, with 2,381 scholars: Total 7,418.

Means of Communication.

The Colony possesses at present three lines of Government railways: The Eastern Railway (110 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, and with Guildford, York, and Beverley, with branch lines from Clackline Junction to Newcastle (14 miles), and from Spencer's Brook Junction to Northam and Southern Cross (Yilgarn) (176 miles); the Northern Railway, with a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district, one from Geraldton to Walkaway (17 miles), and one from Geraldton to Mullewa (57 miles); the South-Western Railway, from Perth to Bunbury (115 miles), with a line from Picton Junction to Vasse (37 miles), and a line from Boyanup Junction to Donnybrook (10 miles)—in all, 570 miles of railway open for traffic.

In addition to these the Great Southern Railway (243 miles) constructed by the West Australian Land Company, Limited, was opened for traffic on the 1st June, 1890. This line connects the port of Albany with the Government railway system at Beverley. Trains run daily between Perth and Albany.

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Guildford and Champion Bay, and connect the two Government railways.

There are also several lines constructed by private timber companies in the south of the Colony, in extent about 52 miles; one, the Darling Range Railway, running from Guildford into the Darling Range (20 miles). The following lines are now under survey by Government:—Northern Railway Extension, Mullewa to Cue, 200 miles; Eastern Railway Extension, Southern Cross to Coolgardie, 115 miles; South-Western Railway Extension, Donnybrook to Bridgetown, 52 miles, and Brunswick to the Collie coalfield, 25 miles. The receipts of the Government railways for the year ending 30th June, 1895, were £298,251l.,
and the working expenses £183,940l. The total cost of construction has been £2,112,818l.

Of electric telegraph at the end of 1894 there were 5,010 miles of wire, and 48 more miles in course of erection. The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1894 was 446,780, and the revenue received £25,986l. (worked by Post Office Department); cost of Post and Telegraph, £77,459l.

There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and also by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the Colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 887 miles of private telephone wire in the Colony, and 794 miles of railway telephone.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient Companies, and Messageries Maritimes carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, and the other Australian colonies. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 30 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, Newspapers per ½-oz. papers |
|--------------------------------------|
| Within a Town                        | 1d. Free* |
| Australasia                          | 2d. ¼d. per 10 ozs. |
| United Kingdom and Postal Union      | 2½d. 1d. per 4 ozs. |

The postal statistics for 1894 give the following as the number of letters and postcards, &c., received and despatched:

| English, Intercolonial, and Foreign |
|------------------------------------|
| Letters and postcards              | 6,069,476 |
| Newspapers                         | 4,164,497 |
| Packets and parcels                 | 888,195   |

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 152 vessels and a tonnage of 5,376 on 31st December, 1894.

**Defence.**

In December, 1894, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 776 of all ranks. Of this number 119 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder to the various rifle corps. King George's Sound, on the south coast, is being strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office. The port of Fremantle is also about to be fortified.

**Aborigines.**

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. They were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they used to be largely utilised as pearl-shell divers, whilst their industry was confined to moderately shallow waters. As a general rule they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. There is now a Board of Management appointed by the Governor, which deals with all matters connected with the aborigines.

*Throughout the Colony within seven days after publication, after that ½d. each.*

**Climate.**

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate is 14 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33·362 inches, and the mean temperature is 64°. The rainy season extends from April to September.

The Windward Islands.

(See Map, page 146.)

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago has been united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. The remaining three British Colonies are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and its population about 146,000.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was united to Trinidad 1st Jan., 1889.
The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

**Constitution.**

Each island retains its own institutions, and when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. A common audit system was instituted in 1889.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling doubloons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

**Communications.**

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 13 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Barbados for the purpose of transhipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call at least once a month, and there is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York, Grenada being the first and last port of call.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A government telephone system of exchanges has been constructed at Grenada, and connects all the out-districts with the town of St. George. A similar system is in course of construction at Vincent. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cable to St. Thomas and St. Croix. The rate per word for telegrams to Europe from Grenada is 9s. 11½d.

**The Rates of Postage are:—**

| Letters per ½ oz. | Newspapers. |
|------------------|------------|
| Internal ...     | 1d.        |
| Grenada, to all parts of the World. | ¼d. per 4 oz. |

**GRENADA.**

**Situation, Area, &c.**

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 183 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 58 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 6,190 souls.

**General Description.**

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and bushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Étang, a lake on
the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. All the roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. There are about 40 miles of driving road in various directions, and the perfect network of byways, all in first rate order, shows that the important item of inland communication has not been overlooked. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1894, 53 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 816 tons. The town has a population of 5,000.

The other towns in the island are Charlotte Town (or Gouyave), Victoria (or Sauteurs), and Grenville (or La Baye). Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois. About two per cent, are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race, except the Indian population, which amounts to about 2,000 souls.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. Yellow fever, the bugbear of the West Indies, is almost unknown, and if new arrivals do get a touch of "acclimatizing fever," which is far from being the rule, it is mild and soon disappears. The average annual rainfall for the last four years is 78-74 inches, and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer at St. George's for the last four years are 93° and 67° respectively, the average mean temperature being 79.5° in the shade.

The island is a great health resort for the neighbouring colony of Trinidad, and in addition to the restoring influence of the climate, it affords excellent sea bathing.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. Unlike the other islands however it has long ceased to be a sugar producing colony, and has therefore not suffered so severely as they have from the depreciation in the value of cane sugar. There are very few sugar estates at present in cultivation. The chief produce of Grenada is, and has been for some time, cocoa, of which 72,623 cwt., of the total value of 168,498l., were shipped in 1893. When the above shipment is compared with the shipments of 1885 (49,107 cwt.) and 1880 (42,154 cwt.), it will be seen to what an extent the cultivation of cocoa has increased. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such as coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, &c. Nutmeg cultivation now occupies a prominent position, and is being largely developed. So general is the cultivation of spices carried on here that Grenada is already called "The Spice Island of the West." The export of spices has increased from 3,483l. in 1880, to 9,584l. in 1894. Tropical fruits of almost every description, and of the finest quality, are always abundant, and large quantities are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, taro, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, &c. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and all the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullet wood, locust, mahogany, white cedar, galba, &c., and large quantities of firewood are exported to Barbados. A considerable quantity of rum is manufactured here for local consumption, the total number of gallons in 1894 being 53,363.

The main imports are food stuffs, textiles, timber, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are Indian corn, cotton, and cotton seed, coconuts, ground nuts, hides and skins, whale oil, and live stock (principally goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry).

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,653; estimated acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, under cultivation, 22,050.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George, established in 1887, with 680 depositors and 5,223l. deposited. Branch banks were opened in the out districts on 1st April, 1889; the number of depositors on 31st December, 1894, was 279, and 2,379l. deposited.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1795–6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated and assisted by the French. The Lieutenant-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred in cold blood, and the Colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercromby suppressed the rising, and the ring-leaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the African slaves.

Constitution.

There was formerly a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, in lieu of the Legislative Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.
The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council was established by the Queen, which now consists of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The unofficial members hold their seats for six years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, under which Grenada was made the head-quarters of the Government.

**Education.**

There are 9 Government elementary schools, and 25 aided schools. The latter are under the local management of the ministers of the different religious sects. Building grants have been made by the Government to assist in establishing schools in districts requiring them, and annual grants in aid are made on the result of inspections. The central administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1888 an Ordinance was passed imposing upon parents as a legal obligation the duty of providing elementary education for their children. In 1894 the average attendance was 3,608 children, the number on the rolls being 6,723. Fees are charged in all schools. There is a grammar school for boys, and two schools for the secondary education of girls, all of which receive grants in aid from the general revenue.
