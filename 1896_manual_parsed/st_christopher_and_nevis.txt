ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

The Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis, and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population is 49,963 by the census of 1891, and the total area about 158 square miles, about the size of Rutland.

Constitution.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of ten official and ten nominated unofficial members; the Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator appointed by him, presides, and the Administrator enjoys an original and also a casting vote. Of the ten unofficial members, seven are chosen from among the inhabitants of St. Christopher and Anguilla, and three from Nevis. The council meets at Basseterre in St. Christopher, and is convened at such times as the Governor or Administrator sees fit.

Industry.

Tobacco was at first the principal crop grown, but it soon lost its pre-eminence, and the main industry of the two larger islands is now the production of sugar, molasses, and rum. Arrow-root, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco are also grown in small quantities. Cattle are raised. Salt is produced in St. Kitts and Anguilla. The sugar crop of 1894 amounted to 16,901 hogsheads for St. Kitts and Nevis, and the export of rum was 56,480 gallons, and of molasses 440,160 gallons.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seacoast of which lies Basseterre, the capital. Basseterre, population about 10,000, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1894, 54 sailing vessels of 1,188 tons.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The temperature is from 78° to 85°.

The rainfall for the year 1894 was 42.45 inches.

Total area under various crops:

| Island | Cane Crops |
|--------|-----------|
| St. Kitts | 15,426 acres |
| Nevis   | 5,483     |

St. Kitts, the native name of which was Liamuiga, or "the fertile island," was the first settled of the Leeward group. Thomas Warner was dispatched thither in 1628 by Mr. Ralph Merrifield, but a hurricane destroyed the first results of his first efforts at cultivation, and it was only in 1625, when he had obtained the patronage and assistance of the Earl of Carlisle, and a commission as King's Lieutenant over St. Kitts, alias Merwar's Hope, Nevis, Barbados, and Monserrat, that a permanent lodgment was effected. On the very day that Warner landed, Desnambuc, with a few Frenchmen, reached the island, and in the face of the common enemy, the Caribs, the two colonies settled peacefully side by side, the French obtaining the two ends of the island and the English the middle portion. From thence all the other islands in the group were colonized, and the settlement grew fast. In 1629 they were almost destroyed by the Spaniards, but soon recovered. The war with France and Holland, in the early part of the reign of Charles II, led to a struggle between the colonists of the rival nations, ending in a victory for the French, the English settlers capitulating in 1666. The English part of the island was restored at the peace of Breda, 1667. The same thing happened during the war of the Spanish Succession, and it was not till the Treaty of Utrecht that the island in its entirety passed into the hands of Great Britain. With all the other Leeward Islands it was captured by the French in the beginning of the wars of the French Revolution, but was re-captured after Rodney's victory in 1788.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he appointed in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it. It has a population of about 1,500, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1894, one vessel registered, with a tonnage of 136.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two Islands—the distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.
The united Presidency now maintains steam communication twice daily, at a present cost of $5,000 per annum.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at £500, and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,300, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, licences, &c.
