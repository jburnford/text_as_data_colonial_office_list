VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass' Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and on the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the colony meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 81' S., longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,944,628 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity; throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places. That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.
Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other colonies of the group, that it now contains 36 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The estimated population, on the 31st December, 1894, was 1,179,103, viz., 607,260 males and 571,843 females. These numbers give a proportion of 94 females to 100 males, or 106 males to 100 females.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 577 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. & O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India, and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number about 1,719. The postal and telegraph revenue is not accurately known, but was estimated to have been £86,700l. in 1893-94, and the expenditure was £67,377l.

Victoria, with the other Australasian colonies, having joined the Universal Postal Union from 1st October, 1891, the rates of postage are now uniform for all countries outside Australasia.

There are 3,020 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1894, was £77,483,663l. The revenue for 1893-94 was £2,726,159l.; and the expenditure £1,635,419l.

There are 7,141 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 14,420 miles of wire; also about 9,700 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams during 1894 was 2,866,365, about 84,000, being on Government business were transmitted free. There are 13 telephone exchanges in the colony, with 2,398 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1893-94 was £130,332l.

Stage coaches run to all parts of the Colony where railway communication is not available.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57°4; the mean atmospheric pressure at 91-3 feet above the sea level was 29-94 inches; rain falls on the average upon 131 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25½ inches.

History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England, he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonization, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement; but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and, rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year, an attempt was made to colonize the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the as yet unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellency of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales, speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to
bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is agriculture, 2,960,299 acres being under cultivation in 1894-95. The chief products were wheat grown on an area of 1,273,888 acres, producing 11,446,878 bushels; oats, 266,444 acres, producing 5,638,286 bushels; barley, 97,860 acres, producing 1,596,463 bushels; potatoes, 56,883 acres, producing 196,706 tons; and hay, 492,578 acres, producing 621,647 tons. About 80,000 acres are devoted to the culture of the vine, producing annually about 2,000,000 gallons of wine. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown extensively. On the 31st March, 1895, it is estimated that there were in the colony 481,547 horses, 1,833,900 cattle, 18,180,943 sheep, and 337,588 pigs. The wool exported in 1894 amounted to 154,286,170 lbs., valued at £4,742,522. The amount of gold raised in 1894 was 678,680 oz., making a total since 1851 of 59,446,235 oz., valued at £27,784,940L. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have recently been discovered are being worked with great success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the Colony will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of black coal raised in 1894 was 171,660 tons. The chief exports other than wool and gold (which comprise one-half of the total), are grain and flour, butter and cheese, hides and skins, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, coal, tea, and iron. About half the trade is with the United Kingdom, and more than a third with the other Australasian Colonies, only one-eighth being with foreign countries. The latter consist principally of the following:—France, Germany, Belgium, United States, Java, and China, in the order named, Melbourne does 85 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool; also Echuca, Wodonga, Wahgunyah, Tocumwal, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1894 numbered 420, with a total tonnage of 90,897.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments of an extensive character, except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on thereat; were this done, the manufactories of the Colony might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. According to the latest returns, there are in the Colony 81 flour mills, which during the year operated upon 8,923,427 bushels of wheat and 374,861 bushels of other grain; 62 breweries, in which 14,208,547 gallons of beer were brewed; 138 brick yards, some being also potteries, which made 48,467,490 bricks, and pottery valued at £39,349l.; 108 tanneries, fellmongeries, and wool-washing establishments, which tanned 1,896,570 hides and skins, stripped 2,360,000 sheep skins, and washed over 8,800,000 lbs. of wool; 7 woollen mills, which used 1,128,542 lbs. of wool, and produced 1,196,832 yards of tweed, cloth, and flannel, 3,700 pairs of blankets, and 752 shawls; 35 soap and candle works, which made 147,000 cwt. of soap, and 57,000 cwt. of candles; 18 tobacco manufactories, which manufactured 1,101,088 lbs. of tobacco, 5,884,000 cigars, 28,500,000 cigarettes, and 512 lbs. of snuff; 7 distilleries, which made 306,100 gallons of spirits; 133 butter and cheese factories which made 18,000,000 lbs. of butter, and 1,106,000 lbs. of cheese; 27 bacon and ham curing establishments which cured 5,800,000 lbs. of bacon and ham; 189 establishments working in books or stationery; 5 in musical instruments; 11 in carving and figures; 8 in designs, medals, and dies; 5 in philosophical instruments; 4 in surgical instruments; 7 in arms and ammunition; 299 in machines, tools, and implements; 255 in carriages and harness; 15 in ships and boats; 32 in houses, buildings, &c.; 81 in furniture; 53 in chemicals; 197 in dress; 17 in fibrous materials; 5 in animal food; 47 in vegetable food; 185 in drinks and stimulants; 58 in animal matters; 435 in vegetable matters; 48 in coal and gas; 46 in stone, clay, earthenware, and glass; 8 in water; 21 in gold, silver, and precious stones; and 35 in metals other than gold and silver. The total number of these establishments is 2,737, of which 1,648 use steam or gas engines, the total horse power of which is 28,834. They employ 89,815 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is £3,641,111.

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other colonies. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation.
upon a large scale. The more important works connected with the principal rivers to provide for the supply for local schemes, are undertaken by and under the direct control of the state. These are known as "National Works," the total expenditure on which to 30th June, 1894, amounted to £75,244. Local schemes are carried out by "Irrigation and Water Supply Trusts," constituted by the Governor in Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Loans are advanced by the Government, and the Commissioners are empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation within the area under their jurisdiction, in order to provide the annual interest on the loan and the necessary payment to the sinking fund; also to defray the current expenses attendant upon the operations of the trust. On 30th June, 1894, there were thirty of these trusts, having jurisdiction over 2,740,000 acres of land, of which about two-thirds is capable of being irrigated, and with power to borrow £1,512,000, of which £940,740 has already been obtained.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, is the most populous city in Australasia, having, with its suburbs, at the end of 1894 a population of 438,955. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (45,936), Bendigo (42,098), Geelong (24,152), Warrnambool (6,600), Castlemaine (6,840), and Stawell (5,250).

Chinese.

By the Chinese Immigration Restriction Act, 1888, the immigration of Chinese is limited to one Chinese to every 500 tons known of any vessel arriving. There are not more than 7,600 in the Colony.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks (exclusive of the City of Melbourne, recently closed), had branches, numbering about 419 in all, throughout the Colony during the last quarter of 1894:-The Bank of Australasia, of New South Wales, of New Zealand, of Victoria, Colonial of Australasia, Commercial of Australia, English Scottish and Australian Chartered, London Chartered of Australia, National of Australia, Royal Australia, and the Union of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to £38,574,214, and the value of the notes in circulation to £1,070,022.

There are also 402 Post Office and ordinary Savings Banks throughout the Colony. The number of accounts open at the end of the year 1894 was 322,721, and the amount on deposit was £7,105,902. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of over £8,000,000 is coined annually.

Education.

Educational establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education; private schools for both primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognized in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1894 was 594. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1894, the total number of students who matriculated was 3,770, and 1,803 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, embrace 10 Schools of Art, 10 Schools of Mines, 3 Working Men's Colleges, and 2 Agricultural Colleges. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes, open to women as well as men; the average number of enrolments of individual students in 1894 was 1,240.

The system of primary public instruction which was commenced on 1st January, 1878, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 16, and state instruction is granted free of cost. In 1894 there were 1,966 State schools, with a total enrolment of 281,321 scholars, instructed by 4,968 teachers. The average attendance was 182,083. In 1893-94 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was £640,929. There is no local control over the schools, and the teachers are paid by a fixed salary only, payment by results having been abolished.

The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1893-94, there were 826 private schools in Victoria, with 2,042 teachers, and an attendance of 35,742 scholars. Of these schools, the Roman catholic denomination had 199, with 691 teachers and 20,978 scholars.

Australasian Federal Council.

Victoria has taken a leading part in promoting the Federation of the Australasian Colonies, and was mainly instrumental in procuring the passing of the "Federal Council Act of Australasia" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act creates a Council of two members from each Colony, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which have only one member each, with power to Her Majesty at the request of the Legislatures of the Colonies to increase the number of representatives for each Colony by Order in Council. This Council has power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits, service, and enforcement respectively of civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they have been passed, the extradition of offenders, and the custody of offenders on ships belonging to Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order.
of Her Majesty in Council, on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two or more Colonies may also refer to it for legislation questions of defence, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and joint stock companies, and other matters of general Australasian interest; but legislation of the Council on such matters is to extend only to the Colonies by whose Legislatures the matters shall have been so referred, and such Colonies as may afterwards adopt the same. It has also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent. The Council is to meet at least once in every two years.

The first meeting took place on 25th January, 1886, when representatives were present from Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed extending the operation of warrants and judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented, and various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits. The second session opened on 16th January, 1888. An address was adopted to Her Majesty respecting the deportation of French criminals to the Pacific. An Act was also passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Béche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Queensland. The Council met for its third session on 29th January, 1889, when representatives from South Australia were present for the first time. The amendment of the basis of representation in the Council was discussed at the session, and communications on the subject have since passed with the Imperial Government. The fourth session opened 20th January, and closed 24th January, 1891. South Australia was not represented, the Act (a temporary measure for two years only) under which that province joined the Federation having expired. The only Bill passed was one to facilitate the recognition in other colonies of Orders and Declarations of the Supreme Court of any colony in matters of Lunacy. An address to Her Majesty was also adopted referring to the desirability of British subjects being placed on an equal footing with subjects of other countries in regard to the acquisition of land in, and trading with, natives of the New Hebrides.

The fifth session was commenced on 26th January, 1893, when the colonies of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia were represented. An Act was passed providing for the discipline and government of the garrisons established at King George's Sound and Thursday Island; and a resolution was adopted in favour of an increase in the number of representatives for each Colony, except any Crown Colony, to five. The Standing Committee was instructed to take steps for giving effect to this resolution, and also for securing the adhesion of the Colonies not represented in the Council. As the result of action taken by the Standing Committee, the Legislatures of all the Colonies in the Federation addressed Her Majesty, requesting that the proposed increase in the number of representatives might be made; and, on 3rd March, 1894, Her Majesty was pleased to make an Order in Council providing "that each Colony which is or shall be represented in the said Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members each."

The sixth session opened on the 30th January, 1895, when the same four colonies were represented as at the preceding session. There were present, for the first time, five delegates from each colony. At this session no Bills were brought forward, but resolutions were adopted affirming the desirability of defining the status, and of granting facilities for the winding up of Companies carrying on business in different colonies; of rendering uniform the laws relating to banking; of establishing an effectual system of quarantine; of adopting a more economic method of raising public loans; and of taking steps with a view to the holding of a second Federation Convention. An address to the Queen was also adopted praying for the appointment of an Australasian representative on the Privy Council Bench, in view of the special features often presented by Australasian appeals. All the sessions were held at Hobart.

Australasian Federation.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Federal Council, however, a movement has been made for the establishment of a more perfect Federation, to embrace a Federal Executive, as well as Legislature, somewhat upon the model of Canada. Towards the end of 1889 negotiations were opened between the various Australasian Colonies, the result being that a Conference of the seven principal Australasian Colonies was held in Melbourne, on the 6th February, 1890. At this Conference it was unanimously agreed that the best interests of the Australian Colonies would be promoted by their "early union under the Crown," and that the Legislatures of the various Colonies should be invited to appoint to a National Australasian Convention during the year 1891 delegates empowered to report upon scheme for a Federal Constitution.

In accordance with these resolutions, delegates were appointed, and the Convention commenced its deliberations in Sydney on the 2nd March, 1891. After an animated debate, which lasted more than a fortnight, a "Bill to Constitute a Commonwealth of Australia" was drawn up and adopted. This Bill the Convention recommended should be submitted for the approval of the people and Parliaments of the several colonies. It provided for the union of the Australasian Colonies in a Federal Commonwealth under the Crown, for a Governor-General to be appointed by the Crown, who should be aided and advised by an Executive Council, the constitution of a Senate and House of Representatives, with certain definite powers, the latter to have the initiation of money bills, which the former might pass or reject, but not amend, and for the establishment of a Federal Judicature; the revenue of the Commonwealth to be derived from the Customs and Excise duties, which should be collected by Federal officers, and expended as required for Federal purposes, any surplus to be returned to the respective colonies. It also provided for absolute free trade internally throughout the Commonwealth, so soon as the Parliament should have imposed uniform Customs duties.

At its last meeting the Federal Council passed a resolution in favour of the holding of a Second Federation Convention on the lines of the Bill drawn up by the First Convention; and a meeting of the Premiers of all the Australasian Colonies took place in Hobart in January, 1895, and agreed to a scheme for a complete Federation, to be
submitted for the approval of their respective Parliaments.

The enabling Bill, adopted at this Conference providing for the election of 10 delegates by each Colony to prepare a scheme of Federation, has already been adopted by the Parliaments of N. S. Wales, Victoria, S. Australia, and Tasmania.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Ministry. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 48 members elected for fourteen Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 95 members returned by 84 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

One of the Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years, so that the tenure of seats is six years; and there is a further special election once every six years for an extra Member for six of the provinces. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council. The property qualification of Members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 100l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 25l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of Members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is under ordinary circumstances three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856.

All Members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 240l. a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The Members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,165 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the Colony. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the Members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1894 there were 58 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 145 shires. The number of ratepayers was 298,559; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 11,676,079l.; representing a value in fee simple of 175,000,000l.; the total income (including 317,024l. received from Government) was 1,436,528l., and the expenditure was 1,379,767l.; whilst their indebtedness (exclusive of amounts borrowed from the General Government) amounted to 3,549,936l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1894 was 115,526l., and its expenditure 147,869l. The debt of the Trust at the end of 1894 amounted to 2,000,000l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1893-94 the Board's ordinary revenue was 177,715l., and its expenditure 239,886l., exclusive of 309,175l. from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1894, amounting to 4,943,222l., of which, however, 2,359,157l. was raised in the first instance by the General Government, and is included in the Public Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works in course of construction amounted to 793,491l. up to the 30th June, 1894.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities, and the Insurance Companies. In 1893 their revenue amounted to 42,782l., their ordinary expenditure to 42,715l., their loan expenditure to 84,755l., and their debt to 100,000l.

The Melbourne Tramways Trust is a Municipal Corporation, created for the purpose of constructing tramways in Melbourne and suburbs, which it has done at a cost of 1,705,794l., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. This debt will be gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a Public Company, to whom the lines have been let for a period of 80 years. On the 1st March, 1894, the sinking fund amounted to 227,286l.

About the 30th June, 1894, the aggregate indebtedness (exclusive of that of the Tramways Trust) of the Colony, general and local, amounted to 54,781,700l.

Defences.

The land forces, chiefly militia, at the end of 1893, comprised an establishment of 5,888 men of all arms, of whom 393 were permanent and 3,195 formed the militia, the remainder being volunteers.

The fleet, which has an establishment of 576 men, comprises the armoured turret-ship "Cerberus," the frigate "Nelson," the gunboats "Victoria" and "Albert," the torpedo boats "Childers," "Countess of Hopetoun," "Nepean," "Lonsdale," and "Gordon;" the steam launches "Commissioner," and "Customs No. 1;" the Harbor Trust dredges "Batman," "Fawkner," "Gannet," and the steam patrol boats "Lion" and "Spray," and the steel Customs steamer, "Lady Loch."

Note.—With a few exceptions the salaries of Public Officers were reduced during the years ended the 30th June, 1894 and 1895, according to a scale, ranging from 5 to 15 per cent.
Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,876 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

Physical Features.

The coast line, extending for a distance of about 3,000 miles, is indented by a certain number of bays, creeks, and harbours, and in the northern parts fringed by numerous islands. In the south there are three separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The loftiest range in the Southern District is the Stanley Range, the highest point of which is about 3,420 feet. The principal other ranges are known as the Blackwood, Darling, and Roe; these, with the exception of Mount William, in the Murray District, 8,000 feet high, do not reach greater altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea. In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the Leopold and the Mueller ranges the highest point in the latter attaining about 2,300 feet. The settled districts are usually level or undulating, rarely mountainous. The western seaboard is comparatively flat, of a sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation. To the eastward of the Darling range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character, and improves as you proceed inland. The north and north-eastern parts of the Colony contain a large area of good pastoral country, suitable also in some parts for the growth of tropical products, such as sugar and coffee.

The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the north, to Point d'Entrecasteaux in the south, a distance of about 800 miles.

Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this range, and flow into the sea to the westward.

The principal rivers of the Colony are the Ord, Prince Regent, Panton, Fitzroy, De Grey, Harding, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoyne, Murchison, Greenough, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Preston, Blackwood, Warren, Pallinup, and Gordon. Most of these are mere storm-water channels filled only during the rainy season, and very few of them are navigable even for boats for any distance.

Lakes.

The lake district may be considered to be confined to the westward of the Darling range; within this area there are numerous salt and fresh water lakes and lagoons—but many of them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.

Numerous islands and islets occur along the coast-line. Dirk Hartog Island, in Sharks Bay, is the largest of those used for pastoral purposes, whilst guano is found on the islands comprised in Houtman's Abrolhos, the Lacedepes, and various other islands on the north-west coast.

History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1828 Captain Gilbert, R.N., in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and in June, 1829, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1850, the Colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution was what is called "Representative," established by Act 33 Victoria, No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The legislature consists of two houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 21 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 33 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The Colony is divided into 7 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the Colony for at least 2 years; (3) a natural born subject of Her Majesty or naturalized for 5 years, and a resident in the Colony during that period.
Qualification of Elector.—(1) Each elector must be of at least 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity; (2) a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, resident in the Colony for 12 months, or a denizen of Western Australia; (3) have possessed for at least 1 year before being registered, and within the electoral province for which he seeks to be registered: (a) either a freehold estate of the clear value of 100l. above all charges or encumbrances affecting the same; or (b) have been a householder for the last preceding 12 months, the dwelling house being of the clear annual value of 25l.; or (c) holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 25l., the lease having 18 months to run; or (d) holder of a leasehold, for the last preceding 18 months, of the annual value of 25l.; or (e) holder of a lease or license from the Crown at an annual rental of at least 10l.; or (f) have his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Boards in respect of property in the province of the annual rateable value of 25l.

Legislative Assembly.—There are 33 electorates for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by a single member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 4 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the Colony for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the Queen, or shall have been naturalized for 5 years, and shall have resided in the Colony for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Any man of the age of 21 years being a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and not subject to any legal incapacity, who shall have resided in the Colony for at least 12 months if he (1) is resident in the district at the time of making his claim and during the previous 6 months; or (2) has a freehold estate in the district of the clear value of 50l. above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same for 6 months next before the time of making the claim; or (3) is a householder for the last preceding 6 months, the house or premises being of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (4) is the holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l., the lease of which has 18 months to run; or (5) is a holder for the last preceding 18 months of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (6) is the holder for the last preceding 6 months of a lease or licence of Crown Lands at an annual rental of 5l.; or (7) has his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Boards in respect of property within the district.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Colonial Treasurer (also Colonial Secretary), the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Director of Public Works (also Commissioner of Railways), and the Minister for Mines and Education.

Local Government.

Under Act 40 Vict., No. 13, as amended by 42 Vict., No. 16, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Perth, Fremantle, Albany, Geraldton, Bunbury, Busselton, Guildford, York, Newcastle, Northam, Roebourne, Cossack, Beverley, Cue, Coolgardie, Day Dawn, Gingin, Carnarvon, and Southern Cross. The municipal councils, with the exception of the last seven, which are presided over by a chairman, consist of a mayor and councillors—the mayor and chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. Under "The Water Works Act, 1889" (53 Vic. 13), the Perth City Council is authorized to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £; also under "The Public Health Act, 1886," Councils of Municipalities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 3d. in the £; 25,919l. was granted in 1894 to district roads boards (of which there are 59) and municipal councils (19) for the repair and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the Colony.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the Colony at the 31st December, 1894, was estimated to be 82,072, consisting of 55,072 males, and 27,050 females, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese was 1,320, of whom 1,313 were males and only 7 females.

The chief towns are Perth (15,703), Fremantle (9,500), Albany (3,000), Geraldton (1,500), York (1,900), Bunbury (800), and Guildford.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the Colony, 5,923,946 acres only have been alienated, while 88,128,993 acres are leased for pastoral, and 2,087,407 for other purposes. No less than 528,420,294 acres are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 3,000 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, three hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley and Eucla districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes, but Geraldton is the centre of a fertile and flourishing agricultural district. In the south-west corner of the Colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the Colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total cultivated area is 193,197 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.
Industry.

The principal industry, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,132,311) are depastured in all parts of the Colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1894, principally to London, was 9,432,876 lbs, which, at 6d. per lb., is valued at £22,201. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1894 was valued at £74,804l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore and China, to the extent of about £28,430l. during 1894.

At Sharks Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounted to £62,805l. in 1894.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but for the last few years little work has been done in them, owing to the fall in the value of these metals. The prospects in copper are, however, improving.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

There are now (30th June, 1895) eleven goldfields in existence:—Kimberley, Pilbara, Ashburton, Murchison, East Murchison, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, and Dundas, and a large population continually employed in searching for, and extracting, precious metals.

Much machinery is now in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a great future before them, judging from the steady increase both in returns and population. The value of gold exported up to the end of 1894 was £1,728,423/19s. 4½d. The gold export during 1894 was £787,099l.

There is also evidence of the existence of good coal both in the south-west corner of the Colony and in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood River, and this export appears for 1894 as valued at £15,274l. There is little doubt that a fairly rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in very small quantities, near Perth.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Australasia.

The average amount of their deposits for the year ending the 31st December, 1894, was £1,808,562l., and their note circulation £143,156l.

A Government Post Office saving bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863, and the deposits during the year, ended 30th June, 1894, amounted to £146,388l.

The establishment of a branch of the Royal Mint at Perth is in contemplation.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are under the supervision of the Minister of Education, assisted by elected district boards. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (35 Vict., No. 14), and are enforced.

Assisted schools of different denominations are also subsidised by the State. The amount expended on education for 1894 was £18,270l., on school buildings £10,643l. A high school is also subsidised by the State.

In January, 1894, there were 116 Government schools in the Colony, with 5,037 scholars on the rolls, and 21 assisted schools, with 2,381 scholars: Total 7,418.

Means of Communication.

The Colony possesses at present three lines of Government railways: The Eastern Railway (110 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, and with Guildford, York, and Beverley, with branch lines from Clackline Junction to Newcastle (14 miles), and from Spencer's Brook Junction to Northam and Southern Cross (Yilgarn) (176 miles); the Northern Railway, with a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district, one from Geraldton to Walkaway (17 miles), and one from Geraldton to Mullewa (57 miles); the South-Western Railway, from Perth to Bunbury (115 miles), with a line from Picton Junction to Vasse (37 miles), and a line from Boyanup Junction to Donnybrook (10 miles)—in all, 570 miles of railway open for traffic.

In addition to these the Great Southern Railway (243 miles) constructed by the West Australian Land Company, Limited, was opened for traffic on the 1st June, 1890. This line connects the port of Albany with the Government railway system at Beverley. Trains run daily between Perth and Albany.

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Guildford and Champion Bay, and connect the two Government railways.

There are also several lines constructed by private timber companies in the south of the Colony, in extent about 52 miles; one, the Darling Range Railway, running from Guildford into the Darling Range (20 miles). The following lines are now under survey by Government:—Northern Railway Extension, Mullewa to Cue, 200 miles; Eastern Railway Extension, Southern Cross to Coolgardie, 115 miles; South-Western Railway Extension, Donnybrook to Bridgetown, 52 miles, and Brunswick to the Collie coalfield, 25 miles. The receipts of the Government railways for the year ending 30th June, 1895, were £298,251l.,
and the working expenses £183,940l. The total cost of construction has been £2,112,818l.

Of electric telegraph at the end of 1894 there were 5,010 miles of wire, and 48 more miles in course of erection. The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1894 was 446,780, and the revenue received £25,986l. (worked by Post Office Department); cost of Post and Telegraph, £77,459l.

There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and also by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the Colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 887 miles of private telephone wire in the Colony, and 794 miles of railway telephone.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient Companies, and Messageries Maritimes carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, and the other Australian colonies. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 30 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 152 vessels and a tonnage of 5,376 on 31st December, 1894.

**Defence.**

In December, 1894, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 776 of all ranks. Of this number 119 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder to the various rifle corps. King George's Sound, on the south coast, is being strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office. The port of Fremantle is also about to be fortified.

**Aborigines.**

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. They were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they used to be largely utilised as pearl-shell divers, whilst their industry was confined to moderately shallow waters. As a general rule they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. There is now a Board of Management appointed by the Governor, which deals with all matters connected with the aborigines.

**Climate.**

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate is 14 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33·362 inches, and the mean temperature is 64°. The rainy season extends from April to September.

The Windward Islands.

(See Map, page 146.)

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago has been united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. The remaining three British Colonies are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and its population about 146,000.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was united to Trinidad 1st Jan., 1889.
The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

**Constitution.**

Each island retains its own institutions, and when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. A common audit system was instituted in 1889.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling doubloons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

**Communications.**

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 13 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Barbados for the purpose of transhipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call at least once a month, and there is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York, Grenada being the first and last port of call.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A government telephone system of exchanges has been constructed at Grenada, and connects all the out-districts with the town of St. George. A similar system is in course of construction at Vincent. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cable to St. Thomas and St. Croix. The rate per word for telegrams to Europe from Grenada is 9s. 11½d.

**GRENADA.**

**Situation, Area, &c.**

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 183 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 58 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 6,190 souls.

**General Description.**

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and bushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Étang, a lake on
the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. All the roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. There are about 40 miles of driving road in various directions, and the perfect network of byways, all in first rate order, shows that the important item of inland communication has not been overlooked. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1894, 53 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 816 tons. The town has a population of 5,000.

The other towns in the island are Charlotte Town (or Gouyave), Victoria (or Sauteurs), and Grenville (or La Baye). Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois. About two per cent, are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race, except the Indian population, which amounts to about 2,000 souls.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. Yellow fever, the bugbear of the West Indies, is almost unknown, and if new arrivals do get a touch of "acclimatizing fever," which is far from being the rule, it is mild and soon disappears. The average annual rainfall for the last four years is 78-74 inches, and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer at St. George's for the last four years are 93° and 67° respectively, the average mean temperature being 79.5° in the shade.

The island is a great health resort for the neighbouring colony of Trinidad, and in addition to the restoring influence of the climate, it affords excellent sea bathing.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. Unlike the other islands however it has long ceased to be a sugar producing colony, and has therefore not suffered so severely as they have from the depreciation in the value of cane sugar. There are very few sugar estates at present in cultivation. The chief produce of Grenada is, and has been for some time, cocoa, of which 72,623 cwt., of the total value of 168,498l., were shipped in 1893. When the above shipment is compared with the shipments of 1885 (49,107 cwt.) and 1880 (42,154 cwt.), it will be seen to what an extent the cultivation of cocoa has increased. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such as coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, &c. Nutmeg cultivation now occupies a prominent position, and is being largely developed. So general is the cultivation of spices carried on here that Grenada is already called "The Spice Island of the West." The export of spices has increased from 3,483l. in 1880, to 9,584l. in 1894. Tropical fruits of almost every description, and of the finest quality, are always abundant, and large quantities are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, taro, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, &c. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and all the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullet wood, locust, mahogany, white cedar, galba, &c., and large quantities of firewood are exported to Barbados. A considerable quantity of rum is manufactured here for local consumption, the total number of gallons in 1894 being 53,363.

The main imports are food stuffs, textiles, timber, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are Indian corn, cotton, and cotton seed, coconuts, ground nuts, hides and skins, whale oil, and live stock (principally goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry).

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,653; estimated acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, under cultivation, 22,050.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George, established in 1887, with 680 depositors and 5,223l. deposited. Branch banks were opened in the out districts on 1st April, 1889; the number of depositors on 31st December, 1894, was 279, and 2,379l. deposited.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1795–6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated and assisted by the French. The Lieutenant-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred in cold blood, and the Colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercromby suppressed the rising, and the ring-leaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the African slaves.

Constitution.

There was formerly a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, in lieu of the Legislative Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.
The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council was established by the Queen, which now consists of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The unofficial members hold their seats for six years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, under which Grenada was made the head-quarters of the Government.

**Education.**

There are 9 Government elementary schools, and 25 aided schools. The latter are under the local management of the ministers of the different religious sects. Building grants have been made by the Government to assist in establishing schools in districts requiring them, and annual grants in aid are made on the result of inspections. The central administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1888 an Ordinance was passed imposing upon parents as a legal obligation the duty of providing elementary education for their children. In 1894 the average attendance was 3,608 children, the number on the rolls being 6,723. Fees are charged in all schools. There is a grammar school for boys, and two schools for the secondary education of girls, all of which receive grants in aid from the general revenue.
