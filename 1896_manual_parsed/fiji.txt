FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs, between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Taviuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterized by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior, 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the "Pandora" in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty." Lying to the north-west, from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hoflua, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1891 to number 2,219, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra, of which about 800 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are three native stipendiary magistrates who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor,
The following table shows the number of people living in each ward of the town at the time of the census of 1861:

| Ward          | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| North         | 2,500      |
| South         | 3,000      |
| East          | 1,500      |
| West          | 2,000      |

Total: 9,000

The table also shows the number of people living in each ward of the town at the time of the census of 1871:

| Ward          | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| North         | 3,000      |
| South         | 3,500      |
| East          | 2,000      |
| West          | 2,500      |

Total: 11,000
1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1894 was 98° in the months of February and March, and the lowest 59° in July. The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva, 111-80 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is the driest period. Between December and April is the hurricane season.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd Jan., 1875. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and four official members, and when sitting for the re-hearing of claims of land, under Ordinance No. 25 of 1879, consists of the ordinary members, with the Chief Justice, the Commissioner for Lands, and Mr. W. S. Carew.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and six official and six non-official nominated members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the Island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and suburbs numbered 834 at the census of 1891. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had on 31st December, 1893, 6 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 180 tons. During the year 1894 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 196 vessels, of a total tonnage of 1,793; of these 55 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 749), and 141 by natives (tonnage 1,046).

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000£. to 19,000£. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:—

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce. The produce contributed consists of sugar-cane, copra, tobacco, maize, bêche-de-mer, and occasionally green fruit and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar mills under contracts which are generally entered into for a term of years. Copra (the principal item in which native taxes are paid) and cotton are sold by public tender annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed price per ton for all that is received. Tobacco, maize, and other products are sold by tender or by public auction as the quantity from time to time contributed, and the state of the market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Bulli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money. The amount thus returned in 1894 was 11,915l. 10s.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

A grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1894 were: Suva town board, 1,491l. and 1,479l.; ditto school board, 679l. and 814l.; Levuka town board, 961l. and 977l.; ditto school board, 518l. and 519l.

Total receipts of local authorities, 3,650l.; total expenditure, 3,789l., in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council, and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva with 99 scholars, and one in Levuka with 106 scholars on the roll.
There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka, and one in Suva, with an attendance of 112.

There is a Government technical school on the island of Vitilevu, within ten miles of Suva, where 78 native youths are instructed in primary education, planting, boat building, and other industrial pursuits. The school is partly self-supporting.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 1,942 schools, with 2,382 native teachers, and 36,158 scholars.

The latter have 143 schools, with 2,010 scholars.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New Zealand has two branches in Fiji—at Suva and Levuka.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the cocoanut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 34 tons were exported. Since that date the cultivation of kidney cotton has revived, and now gives indications of expansion. In the meantime, the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney. This trade increased year by year, until it ranked as the export second only in importance to that of sugar.

The quantity of fruit exported during the year 1892 was 788,100 bunches of bananas, 5,555 cases, and 8 packages (pineapples for the most part), and 65 cwt.s of dried fruit, which, valued at £s. 6d. per bunch and 12s. per package on an average, amounts to £2,064l., but owing to the competition of Queensland and the maintenance of high rates of freight from Fiji the export fell, in 1893, to 348,599 bunches, and 17,421 cases of fruit, valued at £6,597l. In 1894 a slight increase was experienced, the export having amounted to 390,746 bunches and 39,014 cases of fruit, valued at £49,114l.

Freights have been reduced to a lower scale than has previously prevailed. The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, grenadillas, and perhaps mangoes and guavas, which might well be extended.

The following table will illustrate the expansion of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar | Fruit | Copra |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
| 1875 | 96 | £3,417 | 97 | £3,871 | 40,058 |
| 1880 | 593 | £20,920 | 5,216 | £7,339 | 109,758 |
| 1890 | 15,291 | £244,655 | 57,563 | £4,657 | 42,901 |
| 1891 | 20,470 | £327,528 | 61,573 | £6,669 | 63,039 |
| 1892 | 18,883 | £302,133 | 62,564 | £6,067 | 50,812 |
| 1893 | 15,899 | £246,231 | 36,598 | £4,790 | 42,226 |
| 1894 | 27,265 | £436,245 | 49,115 | £5,833 | 57,281 |

The other principal exports in 1894 consisted of:—Peanuts, 130 tons, valued at £2,486l.; desiccated cocoanut, 14 tons 5 cwt., valued at £80l.; cotton, kidney, 19 tons 6 cwt., valued at £74l.; colonial distilled spirit, 138,971 gallons, valued at £16,746l.; cocoanuts, 2,496l.; wool, 1,161l. Minor exports consist of arrowroot, bark, ginger, tortoise shell, gum, angora hair, hides, mats, pearl shell, plants and seeds, sandalwood, tea, tobacco, turtles, yams, cocoanuts, wool, and béche-de-mer.

The cultivation of a superior class of tobacco, specially adapted for use as cigar wrappers, is being entered on by Europeans. The growth of rice has also been commenced, and notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the markets the cultivation of sugar cane is being extended.

About 90 per cent. of the trade of the Colony is with the Australian colonies and New Zealand. There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and all trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through those colonies.

Means of Communication.

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the colony: Sydney, (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Melbourne (10 days), monthly; Auckland (4 days), fortnightly, in connection with the San Francisco Mail Service. Many extra steamers run during the sugar season. Since the end of 1893, Suva has been a port of call of the Canadian-Australian line of steamers running between Sydney and Vancouver. The Colony joins the other Australian Colonies in subsidising the mail service by the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient lines of mail steamers.

Postage to the United Kingdom, via Vancouver or via Brindisi, 2½d. per ½ oz., via San Francisco, 5d.; to the Australian Colonies and New Zealand, 2½d. per ½ oz. Internal postal rates: town 1½d., country 2½d. per ½ oz.; newspapers 1½d. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is two shillings for the first 2 lbs., and one shilling per lb. thereafter.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco in about forty-three days, and letters via Vancouver in about 35 days.

The number of letters, newspapers, and book packets received and despatched by the Post Office during the year 1894 is given in the following statement:
The municipal debt on 31st December, 1894, was 286,190 rupees. Of this amount 218,704 rupees is the balance unpaid out of a loan of 250,000 rupees for the construction of water works at Kandy, and 67,418 rupees balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle in 1890 for the construction of water works.

The value of coffee exported in 1894 was 2,817,488 rupees; the greater part of it, to the value of 1,808,188 rupees, being shipped to the United Kingdom. Cinchona, rated at 202,341 rupees, and tea 46,103,214 rupees, respectively, were exported. The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,892,965 lbs.; 1886, 7,849,888 lbs.; 1888, 23,820,471 lbs.; 1890, 45,799,518 lbs.; 1892, 72,282,525 lbs.; 1893, 82,269,353 lbs.; and 1894, 85,376,322 lbs. The other exports are coconut oil, kernels, coir, copra, and desiccated coconut, cacao, cinnamon, cardamom, citronella oil, plumbago, and tobacco.

The exports are mainly to the United Kingdom, some going however to India, the United States, the Continent of Europe, and Australia. The imports are mainly rice from India, and textiles and coal from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requesta, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever. In addition to these there are the Gan-sabawas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 26 of 1871, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1894 was 44,366, in schools aided by Government 86,968, and in unaided schools 32,576 making altogether a total of 163,910.

The total expenditure on account of the Educational Department was 597,388, as compared with 1868, when the number of scholars was 6,879, and the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education, small fees are charged for English teaching.

The higher education of the Colony has since 1st January, 1885, been mainly left to local effort, as, owing to retrenchment, the Department has been compelled to devote its funds mainly to the extension and development of primary education. The only High School entirely supported by Government is now the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-Aid High Schools. One Government scholarship of 150l. for 4 years, to be spent at an English University, is awarded annually.

There is one school of agriculture at Colombo which was opened at the beginning of 1884, and there are 10 branch institutions officered by young men trained in the Colombo School of Agriculture. Six of these men are paid by Government.

Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-Aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are ten. A central Technical Institute was founded in Colombo in 1893.

There is a Medical College, with a full staff of professors. The lectures are recognised by the examining bodies in Great Britain. There are two departments in the College, the Senior and the Junior. The former consists of students whose course of study extends over five years. A licence to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery is granted to each member of the Senior department who passes the prescribed examinations in the College. The members of the Junior department, after a training of three years, and after passing the prescribed examinations, are qualified to serve as medical practitioners, hospital assistants, dispensers and vaccinators. Female students were admitted from 1st May, 1892. There were 106 students attending during the session 1893-94, of whom 64 (57 males and 7 females) belonged to the Senior, and 42 (39 males and 3 females) to the Junior, department.

The Government maintains 45 hospitals exclusive of those for infectious diseases and sick prisoners, two asylums, one for lunatics and the other for lepers, and 162 dispensaries, of which 42 are attached to hospitals, and 120 independent institutions. Besides these, there are 13 hospitals with dispensaries attached, and 31 independent dispensaries in the planting districts, to afford medical aid to 1,555 estates, scheduled to 31 districts, and 26 sub-districts. There is a government medical staff consisting of one principal civil medical officer and inspector-general of hospitals, 64 officers having British qualifications, of whom one is a lady, 52 having licences of the Ceylon Medical College, 75 medical assistants of local training, 104 dispensers and hospital assistants, 9 inspectors of vaccination, and 99 vaccinators, of whom 2 are females, distributed throughout the island. The cost of working the department amounted in 1894 to rs. 1,266,712-75, the sum of rs. 332,436 58 being on account of estate medical aid. The receipts, which include cost of maintenance of paying patients in hospitals, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, &c., amounted to rs. 176,790-19. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estate Branch of the Department yielded rs. 82,857-26

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British. Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in
circulation is exclusively Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, which is alone legal tender. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pice. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1883, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue, of which the amount on the 31st December, 1894, was rs. 8,915,000. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon. The Chartered Mercantile Bank had rs. 4,355,600, the Madras Bank rs. 6,882,828, and the National Bank rs. 1,879,916 deposits in the island on 31st December, 1890. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank had 54 lacs in deposit on 31st December, 1893.

The Ceylon Savings Bank, was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885, and the two together had on 31st December, 1894, rs. 3,828,377 deposited.

Public Works.

The Colombo South-West Breakwater was commenced in 1875, and was completed in 1885. A single arm composed of large concrete blocks on a rubble foundation running from the shore, a distance of 4,200 feet in a northerly direction, terminates with a slight curve.

In 1893 a Northern Arm, a North-West Breakwater, and the reclamation of 26 acres on the east side of the harbour were sanctioned, and work in connection with these commenced in May, 1894.

The Northern Arm to be a rubble embankment, 1,000 feet long, in a westerly direction, with an entrance 700 feet wide between it and the North-West Breakwater.

The North-West breakwater to be similar in construction to the South-West breakwater, 2,670 feet long, in a south-westerly direction, with an entrance 800 feet wide between the breakwaters.

The total expenditure on the Harbour from 1875 to August 31st, 1894, is rs. 10,637,076.

Works have been constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo. The water is stored in a great reservoir at Labugama 25 miles distant from Colombo, and conveyed by piping to the service reservoir at Maligakanda, whence it is distributed through the town. The total cost of the scheme was Rs. 4,330,000.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—918 miles are open in Ceylon. There are 191½ miles of railway, all owned and worked by the Government.

The lines of railway are distributed thus:—Colombo to Kandy (7¾ miles), Kandy and Matale (17½ miles), Peradeniya Junction and Nawalapitya (16¼ miles), Nawalapitiya and Nanu-Oya (41½ miles), Nanu-Oya and Haputale (25½ miles), Haputale and Bunderawala (7½ miles), Maradana Junction and Kalutara South (2¼ miles), Matare Quarry and Matara Points (1¼ miles), Fort Junction and Wharf (1¼ miles), Kalutara South and Alutgama (10⅔ miles), Alutgama and Galle (3¾ miles), Polgahawelle and Kurunegala (1½ miles). The total cost of construction up to 31st December, 1894, charged in accounts, was rs. 49,394,348*. The receipts during 1894, rs. 5,555,058, and the expenditure rs. 4,145,647. Of metalled roads there are 2,122-06 miles; of gravelled and natural roads, 744-03 and 541-82 miles; of canals, 165-26 miles. The maintenance of 3,407-91 miles of road cost, in 1894, rs. 1,128,493-44, or an average rate of rs. 331-14 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees who collect the commutation received during 1894 a revenue of 965,557 rupees; but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. The amount expended in 1894 was rs. 943,498. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new water works. The amount expended on irrigation in 1894 was rs. 251,356-51.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon, Straits and China, and Australia. 2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles, Ceylon, Straits and China, and India, by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes. 3. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, Ceylon, by steamers of the Orient Navigation Company. 4. A fortnightly service by the steamers of the Nordeutscher Lloyd Steam Navigation Company between Europe and Ceylon. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia and China by these steamers. The passage to Brindisi or Marseilles generally occupies from 15 to 18 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, which is carried on by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company.

Letters, &c., from England reach Colombo in about 17 days (14 minimum, 18½ maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, the Clan Line, the City Line, &c. The steamers of the first leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports in India, and their fortnightly service between Calcutta and London calls at Colombo.

FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Monte Video. They consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Rocne in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited, and almost perpetually icebound. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles (equal to Wales).

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1768 they were taken possession of by France, and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1764. In the following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison, which was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774, and no further formal occupation made till in 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it was moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 694. There is a small hamlet at Darwin. Stanley is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1893, 6 vessels, of a total tonnage of 249 tons. It has a fine inner and an outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going round Cape Horn. There are 2 Government schools there, with 151 pupils, 1 school of the Falkland Islands Company, at Darwin, with 24 pupils, and a Roman Catholic school, at Stanley, with 56 pupils, and 2 private schools for infants with an attendance of 71. The attendance is about two-thirds of the numbers on the rolls.

The climate is healthy, though severe. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The winds rise at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. In winter the weather is less boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. The thermometer ranges from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 65° in summer. The average annual rainfall is 28-80 inches. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the clay is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Stone of two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

In the main the Islands are a wild stretch of moorland, but there is a great variety of sweet-scented flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussock grows to the height of seven feet, with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat. On all the small islands along the coast this grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East and West Falkland since cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in a wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, sorrel, &c., besides a small plant called the tea-plant, known and much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos.

The main industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Patagonia. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were, in 1894—3,294 horses, 8,192 horned cattle, 763,244 sheep.

The chief export is wool. The other exports consist of frozen mutton, sheep skins, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general supplies, and ship's stores.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government savings bank of the usual type was established, in which on 30th September, 1894, the deposits were £2,753l., belonging to 250 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 108,684 acres purchased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a very flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is 100,000l., all paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by A. E. Baillon, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin.
Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England every 21 days. The German "Kosmos" Steamship Company steamers call at Stanley on their voyage to Callao nine times a year, and nine times on the return voyage. The voyage between Stanley and London occupies four weeks. Mails from the Falkland Islands are also carried by the British Company's Steamers between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos Steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and back to the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to the United Kingdom is 4½d. per oz.; to the rest of Europe 4½d. per oz.; there is an internal post 1d. per oz. Parcel post to London, 9½d. per lb. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Monte Video. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of £600.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Judge, the Colonial Secretary, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet.

FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes merely uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs, between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Taviuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior, 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ira rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the "Pandora" in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty." Lying to the north-west, from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hoflua, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1891 to number 2,219, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra, of which about 300 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are three native stipendiary magistrates who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor,
The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1879 was somewhat inaccurate; however, there was then a tendency on the part of the authorities to exaggerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the results of 1879 came to be made known, it had become evident that the opposite was true, and that the impression that the assessment of taxes would follow the result of the enumeration. The birth and death returns furnished during the ten years, and believed to be fairly accurate, indicate a decrease of about 5% in the native Fijian population. The results among the native population in 1864 were 12,300 and the deaths 4,850. The birth rate was 17.5% and the death rate 4.6% per 1,000. The death rate among native children is excessive.

Indian immigration has almost taken the place of Polynesian immigration, hence the progressive increase and decrease in the population of Indians and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian laborers are both cheaper and more suitable than Europeans for work on sugar plantations. The Indian immigrant population now exceeds 10,000 souls.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions give the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1879:

| Wesleyan | 5,418 |
| Roman Catholic Mission | 4,850 |
| Total | 10,268 |

**History**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643 and visited by Captain Cook in 1774. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the "Bounty," signed part of the group in 1789, and was chased off by a canoe from the island of Wava, in the Yasawa group. Missions were started in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American Civil War, led to an influx of Europeans and Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1874, several Englishmen set up a Fijian government with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government became bound into mutual hostility, and the Ministry mainly governed with the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and Fiji and since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1874, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Fijians, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Maua, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 16th day of October...
1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1894 was 98° in the months of February and March, and the lowest 59° in July. The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva, 111.80 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is the driest period. Between December and April is the hurricane season.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd Jan., 1875. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and four official members, and when sitting for the re-hearing of claims of land, under Ordinance No. 25 of 1879, consists of the ordinary members, with the Chief Justice, the Commissioner for Lands, and Mr. W. S. Carew.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and six official and six non-official nominated members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the Island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and suburbs numbered 834 at the census of 1891. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had on 31st December, 1893, 6 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 180 tons. During the year 1894 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 196 vessels, of a total tonnage of 1,793; of these 55 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 749), and 141 by natives (tonnage 1,046).

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000l. to 19,000l. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce. The produce contributed consists of sugar-cane, copra, tobacco, yamona (*Macropiper methysticum*), cotton, maize, boche-de-mer, and occasionally green fruit and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar mills under contracts which are generally entered into for a term of years. Copra (the principal item in which native taxes are paid) and cotton are sold by public tender annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed price per ton for all that is received. Tobacco, maize, and other products are sold by tender or by public auction as the quantity from time to time contributed, and the state of the market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further subdivision among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money. The amount thus returned in 1894 was 11,915l. 10s.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

A grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1894 were: Suva town board, 1,491l.; ditto school board, 679l.; Levuka town board, 961l.; ditto school board, 518l. and 519l.

Total receipts of local authorities, 3,650l.; total expenditure, 3,789l., in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council, and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva with 99 scholars, and one in Levuka with 106 scholars on the roll.
There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka, and one in Suva, with an attendance of 112.

There is a Government technical school on the island of Viti Levu, within ten miles of Suva, where 78 native youths are instructed in primary education, planting, boat building, and other industrial pursuits. The school is partly self-supporting.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 1,942 schools, with 2,382 native teachers, and 36,158 scholars.

The latter have 143 schools, with 2,010 scholars.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New Zealand has two branches in Fiji—at Suva and Levuka.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the cocoanut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 34 tons were exported. Since that date the cultivation of kidney cotton has revived, and now gives indications of expansion. In the meantime, the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney. This trade increased year by year, until it ranked as the export second only in importance to that of sugar.

The quantity of fruit exported during the year 1892 was 788,100 bunches of bananas, 5,555 cases, and 8 packages (pineapples for the most part), and 65 cwts. of dried fruit, which, valued at £s. 6d. per bunch and 12s. per package on an average, amounts to £2,664. But owing to the competition of Queensland and the maintenance of high rates of freight from Fiji the export fell, in 1893, to 348,599 bunches, and 17,421 cases of fruit, valued at £6,597. In 1894 a slight increase was experienced, the export having amounted to 390,746 bunches and 38,014 cases of fruit, valued at £9,114. Freights have been reduced to a lower scale than has previously prevailed. The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, granadillas, and perhaps mangoes and guavas, which might well be extended.

The following table will illustrate the expansion of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar | Fruit | Copra |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
| 1875 | 96     | £3,417 | 97       | £3,871 | 40,058   |
| 1880 | 583    | £20,920 | 5,216   | £7,339 | 109,758  |
| 1890 | 15,291 | £244,655 | 57,563 | £4,657 | 42,901   |
| 1891 | 20,470 | £327,526 | 61,573 | £6,669 | 63,039   |
| 1892 | 18,883 | £302,133 | 62,564 | £6,067 | 50,812   |
| 1893 | 15,389 | £246,231 | 36,598 | £4,790 | 42,225   |
| 1894 | 27,265 | £436,245 | 49,116 | £5,833 | 57,261   |

The other principal exports in 1894 consisted of:—Peanuts, 180 tons, valued at £2,484.; desiccated cocoanut, 14 tons 5 cwt., valued at £801.; cotton, kidney, 19 tons 6 cwt., valued at £741.; colonial distilled spirit, 183,971 gallons, valued at £16,746.; cocoanuts, £2,496.; wool, £1,161. Minor exports consist of arrowroot, bark, ginger, tortoise shell, gum, angora hair, hides, mats, pearl shell, plants and seeds, sandalwood, tea, tobacco, turtles, yams, cocoanuts, wool, and bêche-de-mer.

The cultivation of a superior class of tobacco, specially adapted for use as cigar wrappers, is being entered on by Europeans. The growth of rice has also been commenced, and notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the markets the cultivation of sugar cane is being extended.

About 90 per cent. of the trade of the Colony is with the Australian colonies and New Zealand. There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and all trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through those colonies.

Means of Communication.

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the colony: Sydney, (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Melbourne (10 days), monthly; Auckland (4 days), fortnightly, in connection with the San Francisco Mail Service. Many extra steamers run during the sugar season. Since the end of 1893, Suva has been a port of call of the Canadian-Australian line of steamers running between Sydney and Vancouver. The Colony joins the other Australian Colonies in subsidising the mail service by the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient lines of mail steamers.

Postage to the United Kingdom, via Vancouver or via Brindisi, 2½d. per ½ oz., via San Francisco, 5d.; to the Australian Colonies and New Zealand, 2d. per ½ oz. Internal postal rates: town 1d., country 2d. per ½ oz.; newspapers 1d. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is two shillings for the first 2 lbs., and one shilling per lb. thereafter.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco in about forty-three days, and letters via Vancouver in about 35 days.

The number of letters, newspapers, and book packets received and despatched by the Post Office during the year 1894 is given in the following statement:—
exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

**Constitution.**

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Treasurer; and a Legislative Council of 17 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and eight nominated unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen, are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

**Defence.**

Imperial troops are stationed at Colombo, Kandy, and Trincomalee, and an annual contribution is paid to the Imperial Government for the cost of the European garrison, the strength being 1,582 men. The Colonial contribution for 1894 was Rs. 1,394,559. Trincomalee is a fortified Naval Station, and possesses an Admiralty dockyard. Colombo harbour is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of Dec., 1894, consisted of 1,283 of all ranks.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

The population of Ceylon was ascertained by the Census taken in 1881 to be 2,763,984, being an increase of 14.67 per cent. on the population of 1871. The present population is 3,008,466, according to the census of 1891, the details of which are as follows (including the military, shipping, and estates):

| Province                        | Population |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Western Province                | 763,187    |
| Central ditto                   | 474,487    |
| Northern ditto                  | 319,193    |
| Southern ditto                  | 489,761    |
| Eastern ditto                   | 148,727    |
| North-Western Province          | 320,032    |
| North-Central ditto             | 75,319     |
| Province of Uva                  | 159,155    |
| Province of Sabaragamuwa        | 258,605    |
| **Total**                       | **3,008,466** |

Among these are about 8,000 Europeans, 21,000 Burghers and Eurasians, 200,000 Moormen, 10,000 Malays, 2,000,000 Sinhalese, and three-quarters of a million Tamils. The Buddhists number more than half the population: there are about 600,000 Hindus, 200,000 Mohammedans, and 302,000 Christians. The population of the chief towns was as follows: Colombo, 126,926; Kandy, 20,252; Galle, 33,505; Trincomalee, 11,411; Jaffna, 48,092; Badulla, 5,548; Kurunegala, 4,676; Anuradhapura, 2,497.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea and coffee estates, &c., is about 200,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 250,000.

The area of the Colony is 25,365 square miles, or 16,233,600 acres; and rather more than one-fifth of this, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. About 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The most important productions are:

| Crop       | Acres   |
|------------|---------|
| Rice       | 564,844 |
| Other Grain| 122,329 |
| Coffee     | 20,931  |
| Tea        | 331,466 |
| Cinchona   | 2,062   |
| Coconuts   | 854,221 |
| Cinnamon   | 39,816  |
| Tobacco    | 10,114  |
| Cocoa      | 26,708  |

There are 525 plumbago mines in the island, giving an aggregate yield of over 23,000 tons of mineral every year, the value of which may be roughly estimated at over Rs. 3,353,000. There are 171 gem and a few iron quarries.

The pearl fisheries, for which Ceylon is famous, are carried on on the banks which fringe the east coast. They have for many years been carried on by the Government itself.

The revenue derived from this source fluctuates considerably, as appears from the following statements:

- 1860, Rs. 375,120; 1874, Rs. 101,587; 1879, Rs. 84,567; 1880, Rs. 200,152; 1881, Rs. 599,533; 1884, Rs. 33,658; 1887, Rs. 400,766; 1888, Rs. 804,312; 1889, Rs. 499,201; 1890, Rs. 315,452.

The highest price realised by the sale of the pearl oysters was in 1860, the average being Rs. 129 per thousand. There was a very successful fishery in 1891, which realised Rs. 961,542, the largest revenue since 1814.

The upset price of Crown land is ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs duties, land sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Gam-pola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Badulla, and Ratnapura, amounted in 1893 to 1,916,453 rupees, and their expenditure in the same year to 1,898,124 rupees.

CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustán, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 51' N. lat. and 79° 41' and 81° 54' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 266 miles; its greatest width 140½ miles, from Colombo on the west coast, to Sangomankande on the east. Its area is 25,365 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Málvive Archipelago, 500 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probable Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is roughly estimated at about 30,000, the people being well governed, and energetic traders and seamen. Mali, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands were transferred to the Government of the Straits Settlements in 1886.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustán. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual rainfall is about 100 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November.

History.

The great Indian epic, the Rámáyana, has a chapter describing Ceylon at least ten centuries before the Christian era, but the authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced 306 B.C., and from that date this faith has been preserved in comparative purity,
exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

**Constitution.**

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Treasurer; and a Legislative Council of 17 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and eight nominated unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen, are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

**Defence.**

Imperial troops are stationed at Colombo, Kandy, and Trincomalee, and an annual contribution is paid to the Imperial Government for the cost of the European garrison, the strength being 1,582 men. The Colonial contribution for 1894 was Rs. 1,394,559. Trincomalee is a fortified Naval Station, and possesses an Admiralty dockyard. Colombo harbour is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of Dec., 1894, consisted of 1,283 of all ranks.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

The population of Ceylon was ascertained by the Census taken in 1881 to be 2,763,984, being an increase of 14.67 per cent. on the population of 1871. The present population is 3,008,466, according to the census of 1891, the details of which are as follows (including the military, shipping, and estates):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 763,187    |
| Central ditto             | 474,487    |
| Northern ditto            | 319,193    |
| Southern ditto            | 489,761    |
| Eastern ditto             | 148,727    |
| North-Western Province    | 320,032    |
| North-Central ditto       | 75,319     |
| Province of Uva           | 159,155    |
| Province of Sabaragamuna  | 258,605    |
| **Total**                 | **3,008,466** |

Among these are about 8,000 Europeans, 21,000 Burghers and Eurasians, 200,000 Moormen, 10,000 Malays, 2,000,000 Sinhalese, and three-quarters of a million Tamils. The Buddhists number more than half the population: there are about 600,000 Hindus, 200,000 Mohammedans, and 302,000 Christians. The population of the chief towns was as follows: Colombo, 126,926; Kandy, 20,252; Galle, 33,605; Trincomalee, 11,411; Jaffna, 43,092; Badulla, 5,548; Kurunegala, 4,676; Anuradhapura, 2,497.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea and coffee estates, &c., is about 200,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 250,000.

The area of the Colony is 25,365 square miles, or 16,233,600 acres; and rather more than one-fifth of this, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. About 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The most important productions are:

| Crop         | Acres   |
|--------------|---------|
| Rice         | 564,844 |
| Other Grain  | 122,329 |
| Coffee       | 20,931  |
| Tea          | 331,466 |
| Cinchona     | 2,062   |
| Coconuts     | 854,221 |
| Cinnamon     | 39,816  |
| Tobacco      | 10,114  |
| Cocoa        | 26,708  |

There are 525 plumbago mines in the island, giving an aggregate yield of over 23,000 tons of mineral every year, the value of which may be roughly estimated at over Rs. 3,358,000. There are 171 gem and a few iron quarries.

The pearl fisheries, for which Ceylon is famous, are carried on on the banks which fringe the east coast. They have for many years been carried on by the Government itself.

The revenue derived from this source fluctuates considerably, as appears from the following statements:

| Year | Revenue |
|------|---------|
| 1860 | Rs. 375,120 |
| 1874 | Rs. 101,587 |
| 1879 | Rs. 84,567 |
| 1880 | Rs. 200,152 |
| 1881 | Rs. 599,533 |
| 1884 | Rs. 33,658 |
| 1887 | Rs. 400,766 |
| 1888 | Rs. 804,312 |
| 1889 | Rs. 499,201 |
| 1890 | Rs. 315,452 |

The highest price realised by the sale of the pearl oysters was in 1860, the average being Rs. 129 per thousand. There was a very successful fishery in 1891, which realised Rs. 961,542, the largest revenue since 1814.

The upset price of Crown land is ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs duties, land sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Gam-pola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Badulla, and Ratnapura, amounted in 1893 to 1,916,433 rupees, and their expenditure in the same year to 1,898,124 rupees.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale are being constructed at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London, under the direction of local boards, composed of elective and nominee members.

The expenditure upon construction of works at Table Bay to the 30th June, 1895, has been £2,117,492l., and on maintenance and interest on loans £85,897l. and £44,121l. respectively.

The breakwater is now carried out to a length of 3,640 feet. The graving dock was opened for use in 1882. Its length is 539 feet, and it is capable of taking vessels of the largest class likely to visit these waters. It is constructed throughout of colonial granite.

Extensive additions to the shipping accommodation have been authorised, and are in course of construction, comprising an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater, and a south arm running parallel with it, which will enclose an area of 64 acres, in addition to the inner docks, or a total area, when the works are completed, of about 75 acres, with a depth ranging from 24 to 36 feet at low water.

The works constructed at Port Elizabeth were two iron pile jetties, 1,152 and 840 feet long respectively, which have much facilitated the landing and shipping of passengers and goods; an iron bridge over the Baakens River, and two retaining banks, and the removal of the old wooden jetties, and the old breakwater and shield. The net expenditure from 1st Jan., 1878 to the 30th June, 1893 was £320,625l.* The work of extending the north jetty, at a cost of £100,000l., is completed.

The administration of the harbour is in the hands of a board of seven members, three elected by residents paying 10l. a year wharfage, one nominated by the Chamber of Commerce, two by the Government, and the Mayor being a member ex officio.

At East London and at Port Alfred, at the mouths of the Buffalo and Kowie Rivers, the attempt made to overcome the obstructions of the sand-bars which close the entrances, by the construction of training-walls intended to have the effect of removing the bar by the natural scouring of the stream, has resulted in regard to the former in increased depth of water and general improvement. Two steam pump hopper dredgers are now employed at East London, with highly satisfactory results in opening the entrance channel. To the 31st July, 1895, there had been expended at East London for works and interest on loans, £965,620l. 10s. 11d., and at Port Alfred £741,363l.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin,

* The actual expenditure on works, construction and maintenance of Port Elizabeth Harbour, from 1st Jan., 1878, to 30th June, 1893 (not including interest on loans and not giving credit for the revenue received), was £63,901l.

nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the Mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The River Diggings, which still support a population of between 3,000 and 4,000, extend along the Vaal River, principally on the right bank from above Hebron to its junction with the Hart at Delport's Hope. The Dry Mines at present worked are at Kimberley, De Beers, Du Toits Pan, and Bultfontein. St. Augustine's Mine also figures to a small extent in the production returns.

The following tables give the total quantity and value of the production and export of Diamonds during the past five years:

| Production |
|------------|
| 1890 | 1891 | 1892 | 1893 | 1894 |

Minerals, &c.

Cape coal from various mines situated in the Stormbergan is now extensively used upon the Eastern system of railways, with good results both as regards the working of the line, and the development of an industry likely to prove of the greatest benefit to the Colony. The use of the coal is at present confined to the Eastern system, but a junction line joining the Midland system at Middelburg Road has been constructed from a point a few miles south of Burghersdrop, with the object of providing ready access to the coal for the other systems when circumstances render possible its more extended employment. A good class of coal is procured from the Indwe mine situated in the district of Wodehouse, and small supplies have been drawn from this source at various times. The cost of transport, however, by wagon in the absence of railway connection has rendered its adoption on
a large scale impossible up to the present time. By Act of Parliament certain persons who have devoted considerable attention to the development of this mine, are authorised under specified conditions to construct the required line, receiving in exchange grants of land and money, and the survey is now being proceeded with. The coal from both the Stormberg and the Indwe mines is used locally for domestic purposes and for mill furnaces, &c. The output from the mines during 1894 is returned at 69,690 tons.

In the neighbourhood of the Indwe, trending in a north-east direction, are considerable tracts of Crown land as yet untested, but reported by mining and geological experts to be in all probability the seat of valuable deposits of coal. It has been suggested that these beds may be connected with those found on the north-west border of Natal.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist.

The output from the mines during 1894 was 34,281 tons of ore, the quantity exported being 27,077 tons, valued at 284,800L

Guano is found in large quantities on the various islets along the coast; the industry is under government control.

**Industries.**

The chief industries are the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of the Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked. Those reserved to the Crown cover an estimated area of about 250,000 acres. They are controlled by the Department of Agriculture, at an annual charge of some 22,000L. The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests with anticipated satisfactory results. The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, gold, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are textiles, leather, sugar, coffee, hardware, explosives, and machinery.

The wine exported in 1894 amounted to 83,132 gallons, valued at 18,908L.

Ostrich breeding is not now carried on so largely as heretofore. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in many districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1894 it amounted to 350,404 lbs.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—835 lbs., 403,158 lbs., and 10,008,173 lbs. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871, and stood at 54,540,787 lbs. in 1894.

The Agricultural Department, which was established in 1887, has, by the consent of Parliament, been placed under a separate Minister. Amongst the more important works of the past few years have been the reconstitution of the phylloxerised vineyards by means of the French American resistant stocks, the improvement in the Hackney breed of horses, the establishment of a Bacteriological Laboratory for investigating diseases of animals, and for ensuring the supply of calf lymph for purposes of vaccination, the cultivation of tobacco, and the preparation of raisins and fresh and dried fruits for export purposes. A general Scab Act, passed during the session 1894, came into force in November, 1895, and repealed the existing permissive Acts. The Game Laws are also administered by the department, and an attempt to acclimatise trout is meeting with considerable success. Oysters have lately been laid down in the Zwartkops River, near Port Elizabeth. There are Agricultural schools in connection with the Department at Stellenbosch and Somerset East.

Capetown, East London, and Port Elizabeth are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1894, 29 vessels registered, of together 3,431 tons.

The following return supplied by establishments producing manufactures of the value of 190L or upwards per annum, showed the value and importance of the various industries of the colony in 1890:

| Class of Industry | Value of Articles produced | Number of Workmen | Value of Materials used | Value of Machinery, Buildings, Land, &c. |
|------------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|

| **Grand total** | **9,238,870** | **32,735** | **4,111,912** | **13,001,860** |

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account.

Since the beginning of 1892, the banks having their head offices outside the colony are only allowed to issue notes supplied to them by the government, which holds securities deposited by the institutions for the total supply of such notes given to the banks. The notes are legal tender and guaranteed by the government, the banks having to redeem the notes in gold on demand at their chief places of business.

Banks having their head office in the colony, and having been registered on the 1st January, 1891, can continue to issue their own notes, which are neither guaranteed nor legal tender.

There are 5 banks with 81 branches.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (58 branches), the Bank of Africa, Limited (11 branches), the African Banking Corporation, Limited (14 branches), the Stellenbosch District Bank, Limited, and the National Bank, S.A. Rep.

The total amount of notes in circulation on the 30th of June, 1895, was 563,477L.
Post Office savings banks were established in 1884; on 30th June, 1895, there was 1,441,065l. deposited, to the credit of 41,450 depositors. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. on certificates and 3½ per cent. on deposits.

Number of branches 238.

The weights and measures in use are British; besides which there are the Morgen=¼ acres, the Cape Foot=1.03 feet, and the Cape ton=2,000 lbs.

Education.

Under the Education Act, No. 18 of 1865, and the Higher Education Act, No. 24 of 1874, the department administers parliamentary grants to colleges, and to the following classes of schools, viz.:—undenominational public, district boarding, evening, private farm, poor, mission, aborigines', aborigines' institutions, and special institutions, such as art schools and a normal college, for the following purposes, viz.: Part payment of salaries, purchase of buildings, furniture, apparatus, and books; training of teachers; support of indigent boarders.

Schools are managed and teachers appointed, subject to the control of the department, by local committees or managers nominated by the voluntary promoters and supporters of the schools, or by divisional or municipal councils acting as such managers.

The Government grants are, generally speaking, given to supplement local contributions of at least equal amount. There is no school tax, the necessary grants being provided from the general revenue. The department further undertakes the periodical inspection of schools, collects and publishes educational statistics, and issues certificates of professional competency to teachers.

The Government expenditure on schools in 1893-94 was 175,890l. 9s. 3d. On the 30th of June, 1895; there were in operation five colleges with 378 students and 2,195 schools of various classes, with an enrolment of 107,318, and an average attendance of 79,441.

The University.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowment, &c. The Council consists of 20 members.

In 1891 the number of students who matriculated was 142, 35 passed the intermediate examination, and 16 took direct degrees. In 1892 the numbers were 207, 40, and 19; in 1893, 214, 40, and 24; in 1894, 214, 37, and 28; in 1895, 242, 43, and 25 respectively.

In connection with the University, school examinations are held annually. 12,331 candidates have passed the elementary, and 2,888 the higher examinations during the years 1875-1895.

Sea and Land Communications.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Capetown, by the Western cable, and via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable. The telegraph system is well developed, there being now 14,831 miles of telegraph wire, and 386 miles of telephone wire open, erected by the Government at a cost of 458,000l.; the gross earnings in 1894 being 159,388l., and the expenditure 82,910l.

The packets of the Union Steam Ship Company and the Castle Mail Packets Company, under contracts with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 19 days, and in 19½ days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena. The average passage is under 18 days. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. Up to the 20th June, 1891, the mail packets called at Lisbon on outward voyages to take up the supplementary English and the Continental mails; but after that date it was arranged that they should call at Madeira only on the direct outward voyage, the Lisbon service as well as the St. Helena-Ascension service being performed by the intermediate steamers of the two companies. The mail packets call at Madeira on the homeward voyages.

Steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal calling at Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and East London, to land and embark passengers; and usually leave about 48 hours after the arrival of the English mail.

A "limited mail train" is despatched from Cape Town conveying mails to all parts of the Colony, about five or six hours after the arrival of the English mail steamer, the mails for the Transvaal, Orange Free State, Bechuanaland Protectorate, and Rhodesia, Mashonaland, etc., being despatched only at 9 p.m. daily by train, and the Natal mails are sent overland by this train or the limited mail trains to connect with a steamer at East London.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A "Castle" Company's steamer leaves Natal once a fortnight for Delagoa Bay, and every four weeks for Mauritius and Madagascar. The "Union" Company extend their Natal service to Delagoa Bay once every fortnight. Monthly communication is maintained with East Coast ports north of Delagoa Bay by means of the German East Africa Company's steamers sailing from Natal, and there is a fortnightly service between Cape Town and the Australasian Colonies performed by the steamers of the Shaw, Saville and Albion, and the New Zealand Shipping Company.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily; with Natal daily, via the South African Republic; with the Orange Free State daily, with Rhodesia (Mashonaland, etc.) twice a week via Mafeking, and with the Transvaal daily by rail through the Orange Free State. The latter is the direct route to the Transvaal, and the journey from Cape Town is performed in little more than two days.

Transit between England and Johannesburg and Pretoria by this route is, therefore, about 20 days.

Overland communication is effected by rail through Cape Town and Delagoa Bay daily, through the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The journey is performed in four days.

The number of Colonial post offices is 797, and of money order offices 227. The expenditure on the postal service amounted to 197,206l. in 1893; the revenue was 197,947l., and the commission on money orders 11,603l.
Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1891 the total population of the Colony was found to be 1,527,224, comprising 767,327 males, and 759,897 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 376,987; Malays, 13,907; Hottentots, 50,388; Fingoes, 229,680; Kaffirs, 608,456; and other coloured persons, 247,806.

Cape Town, which had in 1875 a population of 88,289, had at the census a population of 51,261, and with its suburbs, connected by rail and tramway, 83,898, as compared with 50,259 in 1875. The Cape division, which includes Cape Town, had in 1865, a population of 50,064; in 1875, 57,819; and in 1891, 97,283, of which 48,544 were Europeans and white.

The population of the other principal towns was: Kimberley, 28,718; Port Elizabeth, 23,266; Beaconfield, 10,498; Grahamstown, 10,498; Pearl, 7,668; King Williams Town, 7,226; East London, 6,924; Graaff Reinet, 5,946; Worcester 5,404; Uitenhage, 5,331; Cradock, 4,389; Oudtshoorn, 4,386; Queenstown, 4,094; Stellenbosch, 3,462; and Somerset East, 2,894.

The following is a brief abstract of the 1891 census returns:

The number of persons of European descent has been estimated as follows:—Dutch and French origin, 280,000; English, Scotch, Irish, &c., 130,000; other Europeans, 16,000.

The European, or white, then, represents one-quarter, and the coloured races three quarters of the total population of the whole colony, whereof one-fifth is urban. The proportion of females is now 59-03 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 6-90. The number of inhabited dwellings was 276,607, of which 522 were not intended for dwelling houses, though used as such.

Birthplaces.—1,472,996 persons had Africa for a birthplace, 49,849 Europe, 2,344 Asia, 988 America, 890 Australasia; 155 were born at sea, and the birthplaces of 502 were unknown or unspecified. About 98-12 per cent. of the population are British subjects.

Religions.—Protestants numbered 782,047; Catholics, 17,275; Jews, 8,009; Mohammedans, 15,099; other sects, 1,394; no denomination, 638; no religion, 753,824; unspecified, 3,277; and 661 persons objected to state their religion. Protestants may be divided as follows:—Dutch Reformed Church, 297,983; Reformederkerk, 8,337; English Church, 139,058; Presbyterians, 37,102; Independents, 69,602; Methodists, 111,522; other Protestants include, inter alia, 51,557 German Lutherans.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact
Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

There is a Legislative Council of 22 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 76 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony, including the Transkeian territories. The Colonial Ministers are the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Public Works, and the Secretary for Agriculture, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. The session lasts usually from May to August.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act 39 of 1877, a Member is added to the Council for that province. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of £2,000, or movable property worth £4,000. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act of 1892) by possession of property worth £75, or receipt of salary or wages of not less than £50 per annum; but no one can be newly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation. The number of registered electors in 1893-4 was 91,875. The Registration Act No. 41 of 1887 makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy.

Elections are now conducted under the Ballot Act.

Members of either house are paid one guinea per day, with 15s. per day extra for not more than 90 days if residing over 15 miles from Capetown. Speeches may be made either in English or in Dutch (Law No. 1 of 1882).

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The supreme court, as consolidated by Act No. 40, of 1882, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puisne Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall the territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, and Tembuland.

The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold Sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold Sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and Transkei, and the Judges of the High Court holds session at Kimberley.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. A "Native Territories Penal Code" came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John's on 1st January, 1887.

By Act No. 3 of 1890, the Supreme Court has been constituted a Court of Appeal under the Africa Order in Council of 1889.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of eight elective members exclusive of the Civil Commissioner who is usually also Resident Magistrate as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns ten members. The electors are the registered parliamentary voters, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not not less than £500. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they have also important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; may promote the establishment of a Divisional Police Force, on payment to Government of one-third of the cost of such force; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and roadrates. They were 72 in number in 1893, and their receipts during the year 1894 amounted to £179,611, of which £10,973 was money borrowed for public works. Payments for the same period amounted to £174,254. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of which are elected annually by the ratepayers. Town councils or municipalities have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £, on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value, excepting in Capetown, where a landlord's rate of 3d. may be levied.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There were 86 municipalities in the Colony, whose receipts from all sources during the year 1894 amounted to £799,358, which includes £427,801 loans raised and repaid. Payments during the same period amounted to £548,302. The Controller and Auditor-General has no control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 75 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 members elected annually by the voters registered for
Parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 8d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1893-94 to 5,734l.

Defence.

There is an extensive Admiralty establishment and several forts at Simon's Bay, and to defend this Naval station an Imperial garrison is stationed at Cape Town and Wynberg. The defence of the Colony from native attacks, however, devolves since 1871 upon the Colonial forces. These now consist of the Cape Mounted Rifles (838 strong) and the Cape Police (1,169 strong), liable in an emergency, which are permanently embodied and paid. There are also 45 Volunteer Corps, of all arms, numbering 5,971 men (with 12 guns), maintained by a capitulation grant. Table Bay has been strongly fortified at the joint expense of the War Office and the Colonial Government.

Dependent Territories.

Basutoland, which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa, who also holds the office of Governor of the Cape Colony. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of British Bechuanaland, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under those headings.

The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amazosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Nomans Land, as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government, and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Colonel C. D. Griffiths, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885 the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas. Pali, chief of the Amatshezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The PondoMai tribe, under the chiefs Umbitshwa and Umbhlonho, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umgikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umgikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umgikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigcau and Nquiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule, and Magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5, of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Nquiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for 1,000l.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now subject to Colonial rule, and had a revenue of 81,830l. in 1892-93, and an expenditure of 98,646l. in 1892-93; all of this is included in the ordinary Colonial revenue.

They are now re-grouped, under two Chief Magistrates, with several subordinate magistrates, in the following manner, viz.:

Griqualand East, including East Pondoland, under one Chief Magistrate, Mr. W. E. Stanford, C.M.G., and twelve subordinate magistrates. It had (excluding East Pondoland) a population of 4,150 Europeans and 148,668 natives in 1891, at census date.
Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, and West Pondoland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Major Elliot, C.M.G., and nine subordinate magistrates. It had (excluding West Pondoland) a population of 5,179 Europeans and 175,236 natives, including Port St. John's in 1891.

Transkei, comprising Fingolanda, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekalan, all under the Chief Magistrate of Tembuland, and six subordinate magistrates. It had a population of 1,019 Europeans and 152,544 natives in 1891.

CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustán, lying between 5° 53' and 9° 51' N. lat. and 79° 41' and 81° 54' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 266 miles; its greatest width 140½ miles, from Colombo on the west coast, to Sangemunkande on the east. Its area is 25,365 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldive Archipelago, 500 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probable Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is roughly estimated at about 30,000, the people being well governed, and energetic traders and seamen. Mali, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands were transferred to the Government of the Straits Settlements in 1886.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustán. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual rainfall is about 100 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November.

History.

The great Indian epic, the Rāmāyana, has a chapter describing Ceylon at least ten centuries before the Christian era, but the authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced 306 B.C., and from that date this faith has been preserved in comparative purity.
exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

**Constitution.**

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Treasurer; and a Legislative Council of 17 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and eight nominated unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen, are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

**Defence.**

Imperial troops are stationed at Colombo, Kandy, and Trincomalee, and an annual contribution is paid to the Imperial Government for the cost of the European garrison, the strength being 1,582 men. The Colonial contribution for 1894 was Rs. 1,394,559. Trincomalee is a fortified Naval Station, and possesses an Admiralty dockyard. Colombo harbour is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of Dec., 1894, consisted of 1,283 of all ranks.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

The population of Ceylon was ascertained by the Census taken in 1881 to be 2,763,984, being an increase of 14·67 per cent. on the population of 1871. The present population is 3,008,466, according to the census of 1891, the details of which are as follows (including the military, shipping, and estates):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 763,187    |
| Central ditto             | 474,487    |
| Northern ditto            | 319,193    |
| Southern ditto            | 489,761    |
| Eastern ditto             | 148,727    |
| North-Western Province    | 320,032    |
| North-Central ditto       | 75,319     |
| Province of Uva           | 159,155    |
| Province of Sabaragamuna  | 258,605    |
| **Total**                 | **3,008,466** |

Among these are about 8,000 Europeans, 21,000 Burghers and Eurasians, 200,000 Moormen, 10,000 Malays, 2,000,000 Sinhalese, and three-quarters of a million Tamils. The Buddhists number more than half the population; there are about 600,000 Hindús, 200,000 Mohammedans, and 302,000 Christians. The population of the chief towns was as follows: Colombo, 126,926; Kandy, 20,252; Galle, 33,505; Trincomalee, 11,411; Jaffna, 43,092; Badulla, 5,548; Kurunegala, 4,676; Anuradhapura, 2,497.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea and coffee estates, &c., is about 200,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 250,000.

The area of the Colony is 25,365 square miles, or 16,233,600 acres; and rather more than one-fifth of this, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. About 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The most important productions are:

| Crop         | Area   |
|--------------|--------|
| Rice         | 564,844|
| Other Grain  | 122,329|
| Coffee       | 20,931 |
| Tea          | 531,466|
| Cinchona     | 2,062  |
| Coconuts     | 854,221|
| Cinnamon     | 39,816 |
| Tobacco      | 10,114 |
| Cocoa        | 26,708 |

There are 525 plumbago mines in the island, giving an aggregate yield of over 23,000 tons of mineral every year, the value of which may be roughly estimated at over Rs. 3,353,000. There are 171 gem and a few iron quarries.

The pearl fisheries, for which Ceylon is famous, are carried on on the banks which fringe the east coast. They have for many years been carried on by the Government itself.

The revenue derived from this source fluctuates considerably, as appears from the following statements:

- 1860, Rs. 375,120; 1874, Rs. 101,587; 1879, Rs. 84,567; 1880, Rs. 200,152; 1881, Rs. 599,533; 1884, Rs. 33,658; 1887, Rs. 400,768; 1888, Rs. 804,312; 1889, Rs. 499,201; 1890, Rs. 315,452.

The highest price realised by the sale of the pearl oysters was in 1860, the average being Rs. 129 per thousand. There was a very successful fishery in 1891, which realised Rs. 961,542, the largest revenue since 1814.

The upset price of Crown land is ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs duties, land sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Gam-pola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Badulla, and Ratnapura, amounted in 1893 to 1,916,433 rupees, and their expenditure in the same year to 1,898,124 rupees.
The municipal debt on 31st December, 1894, was 286,190 rupees. Of this amount 218,704 rupees is the balance unpaid out of a loan of 250,000 rupees for the construction of water works at Kandy, and 67,418 rupees balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle in 1890 for the construction of water works.

The value of coffee exported in 1894 was 2,817,488 rupees; the greater part of it, to the value of 1,808,138 rupees, being shipped to the United Kingdom. Cinchona, rated at 202,341 rupees, and tea 46,103,214 rupees, respectively, were exported. The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1886, 7,849,888 lbs.; 1888, 23,820,471 lbs.; 1890, 45,799,518 lbs.; 1892, 72,282,525 lbs.; 1893, 82,269,353 lbs.; and 1894, 85,376,822 lbs. The other exports are coconut oil, kernels, coir, copra, and desiccated coconut, cacao, cinnamon, cardamoms, citronella oil, plumbago, and tobacco.

The exports are mainly to the United Kingdom, some going however to India, the United States, the Continent of Europe, and Australia. The imports are mainly rice from India, and textiles and coal from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever. In addition to these there are the Ganabawas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 26 of 1871, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1894 was 44,366, in schools aided by Government 86,968, and in unaided schools 32,576 making altogether a total of 163,910.

The total expenditure on account of the Educational Department was 597,388, as compared with 1868, when the number of scholars was 6,879, and the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education, small fees are charged for English teaching.

The higher education of the Colony has since 1st January, 1885, been mainly left to local effort, as, owing to retrenchment, the Department has been compelled to devote its funds mainly to the extension and development of primary education. The only High School entirely supported by Government is now the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-Aid High Schools. One Government scholarship of 150l. for 4 years, to be spent at an English University, is awarded annually.

There is one school of agriculture at Colombo which was opened at the beginning of 1884, and there are 10 branch institutions officered by young men trained in the Colombo School of Agriculture. Six of these men are paid by Government.

Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-Aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are ten. A central Technical Institute was founded in Colombo in 1893.

There is a Medical College, with a full staff of professors. The lectures are recognised by the examining bodies in Great Britain. There are two departments in the College, the Senior and the Junior. The former consists of students whose course of study extends over five years. A licence to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery is granted to each member of the Senior department who passes the prescribed examinations in the College. The members of the Junior department, after a training of three years, and after passing the prescribed examinations, are qualified to serve as medical practitioners, hospital assistants, dispensers and vaccinators. Female students were admitted from 1st May, 1892. There were 106 students attending during the session 1893-94, of whom 64 (57 males and 7 females) belonged to the Senior, and 42 (39 males and 3 females) to the Junior, department.

The Government maintains 45 hospitals exclusive of those for infectious diseases and sick prisoners, two asylums, one for lunatics and the other for lepers, and 162 dispensaries, of which 42 are attached to hospitals, and 120 independent institutions. Besides these, there are 13 hospitals with dispensaries attached, and 31 independent dispensaries in the planting districts, to afford medical aid to 1,555 estates, scheduled to 31 districts, and 26 sub-districts. There is a government medical staff consisting of one principal civil medical officer and inspector-general of hospitals, 64 officers having British qualifications, of whom one is a lady, 52 having licences of the Ceylon Medical College, 75 medical assistants of local training, 104 dispensers and hospital assistants, 9 inspectors of vaccination, and 99 vaccinators, of whom 2 are females, distributed throughout the island. The cost of working the department amounted in 1894 to rs. 1,266,712-75, the sum of rs., 332,436 58 being on account of estate medical aid. The receipts, which include cost of maintenance of paying patients in hospitals, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, &c., amounted to rs. 176,790-19. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estate Branch of the Department yielded rs. 82,857-26.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British. Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in
circulation is exclusively Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, which is alone legal tender. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pie. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1898, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1894, the Government has instituted a note-issue, of which the amount on the 31st December, 1894, was Rs. 8,915,000. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited, Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon. The Chartered Mercantile Bank had Rs. 4,355,600, the Madras Bank Rs. 6,862,828, and the National Bank Rs. 1,271,916 deposits in the island on 31st December, 1890. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank had £4 lac in deposit on 31st December, 1893.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1862, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885, and the two together had on 31st December, 1894, Rs. 3,828,377 deposited.

Public Works.

The Colombo South-West Breakwater was commenced in 1875, and was completed in 1875. A single arm composed of large concrete blocks on a rubble foundation running from the shore, a distance of 4,200 feet in a northerly direction, terminates with a slight curve.

In 1893 a Northern Arm, a North-West Breakwater, and the reclamation of 26 acres on the east side of the harbour were sanctioned, and work in connection with these commenced in May, 1894.

The Northern Arm to be a rubble embankment, 1,000 feet long, in a westerly direction, with an entrance 700 feet wide between it and the North-West Breakwater.

The North-West breakwater to be similar in construction to the South-West breakwater, 2,670 feet long, in a south-westery direction, with an entrance 800 feet wide between the breakwaters.

The total expenditure on the Harbour from 1875 to August 31st, 1894, is Rs. 10,637,076.

Works have been constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo. The water is stored in a great reservoir at Labugama 25 miles distant from Colombo, and conveyed by piping to the service reservoir at Maligakanda, whence it is distributed through the town. The total cost of the scheme was Rs. 4,350,000.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—918 miles are open in Ceylon. There are 1,914 miles of railway, all owned and worked by the Government.

The lines of railway are distributed thus:—Colombo to Kandy (74½ miles), Kandy and Matale (17¼ miles), Peradeniya Junction and Nawalapitiya (16¾ miles), Nawalapitiya and Nanu-Oya (41½ miles), Nanu-Oya and Haputale (25¼ miles), Haputale and Buduerawela (7¼ miles), Maradana Junction and Kalutara South (27¼ miles), Matara Quarry and Matara Points (1¾ miles), Fort Junction and Wharf (1¼ miles), Kalutara South and Alutgama (10¾ miles), Alutgama and Galle (33½ miles), Polgahawelle and Kurunegala (18½ miles). The total cost of construction up to 31st December, 1894, charged in accounts, was Rs. 49,894,348*. The receipts during 1894, Rs. 5,555,058, and the expenditure Rs. 4,145,047. Of metalled roads there are 2,122-06 miles; of gravelled and natural roads, 744-08 and 541-82 miles; of canals, 165-25 miles. The maintenance of 3,407-91 miles of road cost, in 1894, Rs. 1,128,493-44, or an average rate of Rs. 351-14 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees who collect the commutation received during 1894 a revenue of 965,587 rupees; but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. The amount expended in 1894 was Rs. 943,458. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new water works. The amount expended on irrigation in 1894 was Rs. 251,356-51.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon, Straits and China, and Australia. 2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles, Ceylon, Straits and China, and India, by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes. 3. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, Ceylon, by steamers of the Orient Navigation Company. 4. A fortnightly service by the steamers of the Norddeutscher Lloyd Steam Navigation Company between Europe and Ceylon. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia and China by these steamers. The passage to Brindisi or Marselles generally occupies from 15 to 18 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, which is carried on by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company.

Letters, &c., from England reach Colombo in about 17 days (14 minimum, 18½ maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, the Clan Line, the City Line, &c. The steamers of the first leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports in India, and their fortnightly service between Calcutta and London calls at Colombo.

FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Monte Video. They consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,800 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Rocne in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited, and almost perpetually icebound. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles (equal to Wales).

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1763 they were taken possession of by France, and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1764. In the following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison, which was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774, and no further formal occupation made till in 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it was moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 694. There is a small hamlet at Darwin. Stanley is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1893, 6 vessels, of a total tonnage of 249 tons. It has a fine inner and an outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going round Cape Horn. There are 2 Government schools there, with 151 pupils, 1 school of the Falkland Islands Company, at Darwin, with 24 pupils, and a Roman Catholic school, at Stanley, with 56 pupils, and 2 private schools for infants with an attendance of 71. The attendance is about two-thirds of the numbers on the rolls.

The climate is healthy, though severe. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The winds rise at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. In winter the weather is less boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. The thermometer ranges from 30° to 60° in winter, and from 40° to 65° in summer. The average annual rainfall is 28-80 inches. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the clay is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Stone of two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

In the main the Islands are a wild stretch of moorland, but there is a great variety of sweet-scented flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussock grows to the height of seven feet, with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat. On all the small islands along the coast this grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East and West Falkland since cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in a wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, sorrel, &c., besides a small plant called the tea-plant, known and much used formerly by the sealers and Ganchos.

The main industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Patagonia. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were, in 1894—8,294 horses, 8,192 horned cattle, 763,244 sheep.

The chief export is wool. The other exports consist of frozen mutton, sheep skins, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general supplies, and ship's stores.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government savings bank of the usual type was established, in which on 30th September, 1894, the deposits were £2,753l., belonging to 250 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 108,684 acres purchased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a very flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is 100,000l., all paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by A. E. Baillon, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin.
Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England every 21 days. The German "Kosmos" Steamer Company steamers call at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao nine times a year, and nine times on the return voyage. The voyage between Stanley and London occupies four weeks. Mails for the Falkland Islands are also carried by the Pacific Company's Steamers, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos Steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to the United Kingdom 2½d. per ½ oz.; to the rest of Europe 4d. per ½ oz.; there is an internal post 1d. the ½ oz. Parcel Postage to London, 9d. per lb. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Monte Video. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of 600l.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Judge, the Colonial Secretary, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet.

FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs, between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Taviuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterized by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior, 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Iba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the "Pandora" in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty." Lying to the north-west, from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hodua, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1891 to number 2,219, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra, of which about 800 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are three native stipendiary magistrates who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor,
rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotuman Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner, the chiefs, and magistrates). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji.

**Population.**

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1881 and 1891 respectively, was found to be as follows:

| Class of population | Males | Females | Total |
|---------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Europeans           | 1,879 | 987     | 2,866 |
| Half-Castes         | 388   | 388     | 776   |
| Indians             | 5,629 | 5,629   | 11,258|
| Polynesians         | 60,899| 60,899  | 121,798|
| Fijians             | 1,126 | 1,126   | 2,252 |
| Rotumans            | 1,666 | 1,666   | 3,332 |
| Others              | 1,666 | 1,666   | 3,332 |
| **Total**           | 70,401| 67,981  | 138,382|

Net decrease during the decade 31st Dec., 1891

The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1881 was somewhat incorrect inasmuch as there was then a tendency on the part of the natives to exaggerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the census of 1891 came to be made, that tendency had taken a turn in the opposite direction, under the impression that the assessment of taxes would follow the result of the enumeration. The birth and death returns furnished during the ten years, and believed to be fairly accurate, indicate a decrease of about 4,500 in the native Fijian population. The births among the native population in 1894 were 3,912, and the deaths 4,630. The birth rate was 37-70, and the death rate 44-63 per mil. The death rate among native children is excessive.

Indian immigration has almost taken the place of Polynesian immigration, hence the respective increase and decrease in the population of Indians and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian labourers are both cheaper and more suitable than Polynesians for work on sugar plantations. The Indian immigrant population now exceeds 10,000 souls.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions give the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1894:

| Wesleyan          | ... | ... | 98,297 |
| Roman Catholic Mission | ... | ... | 9,580 |
| **Total**         | ... | ... | 107,877 |

**History.**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the "Bounty," sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the Island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1865, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October.
1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1894 was 98° in the months of February and March, and the lowest 59° in July. The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva, 111-80 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is the driest period. Between December and April is the hurricane season.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd Jan., 1875. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and four official members, and when sitting for the re-hearing of claims of land, under Ordinance No. 25 of 1879, consists of the ordinary members, with the Chief Justice, the Commissioner for Lands, and Mr. W. S. Carew.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and six official and six non-official nominated members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the Island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and suburbs numbered 884 at the census of 1891. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had on 31st December, 1893, 6 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 180 tons. During the year 1894 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 196 vessels, of a total tonnage of 1,793; of these 55 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 749), and 141 by natives (tonnage 1,046).

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000£. to 19,000£. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce. The produce contributed consists of sugar-cane, copra, tobacco, yagona (Macropiper melhythmicum), cotton, maize, bêche-de-mer, and occasionally green fruit and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar mills under contracts which are generally entered into for a term of years. Copra (the principal item in which native taxes are paid) and cotton are sold by public tender annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed price per ton for all that is received. Tobacco, maize, and other products are sold by tender or by public auction as the quantity from time to time contributed, and the state of the market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money. The amount thus returned in 1894 was 11,915£. 10s.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

A grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1894 were: Suva town board, 1,491£. and 1,479£.; ditto school board, 679£. and 814£.; Levuka town board, 961£. and 977£.; ditto school board, 518£. and 519£.

Total receipts of local authorities, 3,650£.; total expenditure, 3,789£., in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council, and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva with 99 scholars, and one in Levuka with 106 scholars on the roll.
There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka, and one in Suva, with an attendance of 112.

There is a Government technical school on the island of Vitilevu, within ten miles of Suva, where 78 native youths are instructed in primary education, planting, boat building, and other industrial pursuits. The school is partly self-supporting.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 1,942 schools, with 2,382 native teachers, and 86,158 scholars.

The latter have 143 schools, with 2,010 scholars.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New Zealand has two branches in Fiji—at Suva and Levuka.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the cocoanut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. Since that date the cultivation of kidney cotton has revived, and now gives indications of expansion. In the meantime, the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney. This trade increased year by year, until it ranked as the export second only in importance to that of sugar.

The quantity of fruit exported during the year 1892 was 788,100 bunches of bananas, 5,555 cases, and 8 packages (pineapples for the most part), and 65 cwt.s of dried fruit, which, valued at £s. 6d. per bunch and 12s. per package on an average, amounts to £2,664l., but owing to the competition of Queensland and the maintenance of high rates of freight from Fiji the export fell, in 1893, to 348,599 bunches, and 17,421 cases of fruit, valued at £36,597l. In 1894 a slight increase was experienced, the export having amounted to 390,746 bunches and 33,014 cases of fruit, valued at £49,114l. Freights have been reduced to a lower scale than has previously prevailed. The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, grenadillas, and perhaps mangoes and guavas, which might well be extended.

The following table will illustrate the expansion of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar | Fruits | Copra |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
| 1875 | 96     | £3,417 | 97     | £3,871 | 190     | £40,058 |
| 1880 | 593    | £20,920 | 5,216  | £7,339 | 14      | £109,752 |
| 1890 | 15,291 | £244,655 | 57,563 | £4,657 | 2,496   | £42,901 |
| 1891 | 20,470 | £327,526 | 61,573 | £6,669 | 1,161   | £63,039 |
| 1892 | 18,883 | £302,133 | 62,564 | £8,067 | 5,833   | £50,812 |
| 1893 | 15,849 | £246,231 | 36,598 | £4,790 | 4,225   | £42,225 |
| 1894 | 27,265 | £436,245 | 49,115 | £5,833 | 57,261 |

The other principal exports in 1894 consisted of:—Peanuts, 190 tons, valued at £2,484l.; desiccated cocoanut, 14 tons 5 cwt., valued at £80l.; cotton kidney, 19 tons 6 cwt., valued at £74l.; colonial distilled spirit, 138,971 gallons, valued at £16,746l.; cocoanuts, 2,496l.; wool, 1,161l. Minor exports consist of arrowroot, bark, ginger, tortoise shell, gum, angora hair, hides, mats, pearl shell, plants and seeds, sandalwood, tea, tobacco, turtles, yams, cocoanuts, wool, and bêche-de-mer.

The cultivation of a superior class of tobacco, specially adapted for use as cigar wrappers, is being entered on by Europeans. The growth of rice has also been commenced, and notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the markets the cultivation of sugar cane is being extended.

About 90 per cent. of the trade of the Colony is with the Australian colonies and New Zealand. There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and all trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through those colonies.

Means of Communication.

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the colony:—Sydney, (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Melbourne (10 days), monthly; Auckland (4 days), fortnightly, in connection with the San Francisco Mail Service. Many extra steamers run during the sugar season. Since the end of 1893, Suva has been a port of call of the Canadian-Australian line of steamers running between Sydney and Vancouver. The Colony joins the other Australian Colonies in subsidising the mail service by the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient lines of mail steamers.

Postage to the United Kingdom, via Vancouver or via Brindisi, 2½d. per ½ oz., via San Francisco, 5d.; to the Australian Colonies and New Zealand, 2d. per ½ oz. Internal postal rates: town 1d., country 2d. per ½ oz.; newspapers 1d. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is two shillings for the first 2 lbs., and one shilling per lb. thereafter.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco in about forty-three days, and letters via Vancouver in about 35 days.

The number of letters, newspapers, and book packets received and despatched by the Post Office during the year 1894 is given in the following statement:—

There is no railway or telegraph in the colony. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Auckland (N.Z.) and Sydney, (N.S.W.). Intercommunication within the group is maintained by sailing boats and steam launches, and by an inter-island steamer. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands.
