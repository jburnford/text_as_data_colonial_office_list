Straits Settlements.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament 29 & 30 Vict., c. 115.

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 10' north, and long. 102° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the main land, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 288 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 265 square miles, two-thirds forest, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coaling steamers to call regularly. The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed, by letters patent of 13th October, 1878, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., annexed in July, 1888, was placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. It is nine miles long and nine miles wide; wooded, but uninhabited. It lies 200 miles S.W. of Java.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is 1,542 square miles (nearly equal to that of Kent).

History.

Malacca, known as an important independent state from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795 when it was taken possession of by the English and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally passed into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland of the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should leave the Malay Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch restrictions; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade,
which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon (Puket or Tongkah), and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island as it is officially called, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1783, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1798, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Raja, now called Province Wellesley. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 288 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and coconuts. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangku and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Native Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British, and the whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

There is some evidence of Singapore having been an important trading centre in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the tradition is that the place was attacked and devastated in 1252 by the Javanese. Thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johor princes. It was at first subordinate to Bencoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1825 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated, in 1826, with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

**Constitution, Law, and Justice.**

The government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 9 official members and 7 unofficial members, of whom two are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts.

There is a Supreme Court which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

**Defence.**

The new harbour of Singapore, comprising the coal stores, wharves, and docks, is defended by several forts armed with armour piercing and medium guns, and by a system of submarine mines. The initial cost of the forts amounted to nearly 100,000£, and was defrayed out of the revenue of the Colony; the Imperial Government supplying the guns and ammunition only.

The garrison comprises one battalion of infantry at war strength, one company of garrison artillery on the higher establishment, and district establishment royal artillery, one company of Asiatic artillery, half a company of fortress engineers, and a company of Malay submarine miners.

The Colony also maintains an armed police force, consisting of 32 officers and over 1,500 men, and a battery of volunteer artillery, consisting of 100 officers and men. The latter during time of war would be placed under the orders of the officer commanding the troops, and act as auxiliaries to the European artillery.

**Climate.**

The climate varies but little in temperature during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1894 was 79°-1° F.; in Penang, 79°-8° F.; in Province Wellesley, 81°-2° F.; and in Malacca, 78°-9° F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 93°-5° and 69°-0° F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations from 1869 to 1890 it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 167 wet days; the average rainfall for the same period being 91-79 inches. In 1894 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 81-24 inches, in Penang 80-24 inches, in Province Wellesley 75-63 inches, in Malacca, 91-24 inches, and in the Dindings 75-09 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have south-east, south or south-west winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.

**Population.**

At the census taken in April, 1881 and 1891, the population of the settlements was ascertained to be as follows:

|                | 1881     | 1891     |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Singapore      | 139,208  | 184,554  |
| Penang, Province Wellesley, and Dindings | 190,597  | 235,618  |
| Malacca        | 93,579   | 92,170   |
| **Total**      | **423,384** | **512,342** |

The total at the census of 1866 was 273,000.

" " 1871 " 307,951.

**Trade.**

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of 1 anna per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmegs, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides.
and horus, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, &c. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are gambier and pepper (in Singapore); tapioca and rice (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). The quantities of some of the exports in 1893 were: Coffee, 83,973 pikuls; gambier, 806,282 pikuls; gums, 179,241 pikuls; spices, 1,058,862; tapioca, 649,662 pikuls; and tin, 865,732 pikuls. The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The quantities imported in 1894 were: Cotton piece goods, 5,595,310 pieces; coal, 438,737 tons; rice, 7,020,671 pikuls; opium, 15,054 chests; and silk piece goods, 288,549 pieces. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and the Native States. Singapore and Georgetown (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had on the 31st December, 1894, 659 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 35,374.

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of sea-going steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe, via Ceylon, and with China and Japan weekly by the P. and O., Messageries Maritimes, and Ocean Company (Holt's) steamers, and at longer intervals by those of the German Mail (Nords, Lloyd's), Austro-Hungary Lloyd's, British India, Glen, and other lines; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla, via Saigon, by Messageries Maritimes and Spanish packets; with Bangkok weekly by Holt's and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Messageries Maritimes and Netherlands India Company's steamers; with Australian ports weekly, and otherwise by P. and O. and Messageries Maritimes, via Ceylon, by British India, China Navigation Company, and other lines; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, fortnightly by the Negapatam steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, British India, Apcar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and other ports of the Native States, &c., by local lines. Most of the larger steamers call at Penang. Letters from England reach Singapore in from 21 to 26 days.

Postage and Communications.

| Letters, per ½ oz. | Printed papers per 2 oz. |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Within the Colony, and to the Protected Native States and Johor | 3 cents | 1 cent |
| To all parts of the world outside the Straits Settlements, the Protected Native States, and Johor | 8 cents | 1 cent |

The number of letters, books, &c., received in 1894 was 2,760,420, and 2,778,960 were dispatched.

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1894 to $671,231, the principal business done being with the United Kingdom, India, and the Native States.

There is telegraphic communication by submarine cables (3) from Penang to Madras, Malacca, and Singapore; and from Singapore (2) to Saigon and Hue, and thence to Hong Kong, Japan, and Russia. There is also a Government telegraph line from Penang to Province Wellesley and thence to Perak, Selangor, Sungei Ujong, and Malacca. The cable from Singapore to Malacca is subsidized by the Government. There are 20 miles of telegraph line in connection with the cables, and there are 1,018 miles of telephone line. There are no railways within the Colony itself, but there is a tramway in Singapore from the docks to the business portion of the town, about 4 miles. In Penang there are 9 miles of tramway open, constructed and worked by a private firm; the motive power in both places is steam.

Education.

There is no law affecting education. The expenditure on education is voted each year by the Legislative Council of the Colony. The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Inspector of Schools.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unsectarian, and there is no compulsory education.

The number of schools and scholars is as follows:

| No. of Schools | Attendance |
|---------------|------------|
| Grant-in-aid boys' schools | 25 | 4,129 |
| Grant-in-aid girls' schools | 11 | 1,148 |
| Government English schools | 8 | 970 |
| Government vernacular boys' schools | 152 | 6,459 |
| Government vernacular girls' schools | 27 | 747 |
| **Total** | **223** | **13,433** |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the colony, by an order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, is the silver Mexican dollar, but the British dollar, the Japanese yen, and the old Hong Kong dollar, are also legal tender.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively.

The amount of coin in circulation is estimated at seven and a half million dollars.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Mercantile Bank of India Limited, and the Netherlands Trading Society.

The aggregate note issue amounts to seven and a half million dollars.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1894, the deposits amounted to $230,677.97.

The Native Weights are:

- 1 kati = 16 tahil = 1¼ lb.
- 100 kati = 1 picul = 133¾ lbs.
- 40 picul = 1 koyan = 538¾ lbs.
Local Government.

There are Municipal Boards at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, the members of which are partly elected by the ratepayers and partly nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1894 was $1,012,324; and the expenditure $1,038,491.

THE PROTECTED NATIVE STATES IN THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years prior to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (29th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungai Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889, by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungai Ujong, who since 1885 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland state of Jejulu, and in August of that year an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present federal state (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to aid the native rulers by advice, and generally to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native authorities and the principal English officials.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State, and are subordinate to the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In addition to the above States, the State and Territory of Johor, with which a treaty had been made as early as the year 1835, and other treaties subsequently, entered into closer relations with the Colony in 1887, when the Sultan placed his foreign relations in the hands of the British Government, and agreed to receive a British Agent.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States (Johor excluded), by which they
agreed to constitute their countries a federation (to be known as the Protected Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States, who will control the Residents appointed to each State and be the means of communication between the State Governments and the Governor of the Straits Settlements. Subject to the new authority created by the appointment of this officer, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remain unchanged.

The States undertake to give each other material assistance in men and money; the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertake to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States; and should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power they engage to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

Statistics.

The following figures will give an idea of the relative importance of the four Protected States with British Residents:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| Pétrak | $3,034,094 | $2,895,589 |
| Selangor | 2,765,851 | 2,605,588 |
| S. Ujong, and | 888,976 | 876,562 |
| N. Sembilan | 180,988 | 182,067 |
| Pahang | 83,688 | 222,236 |

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| Pétrak | $3,542,115 | $8,587,224 |
| Selangor | 3,834,468 | 2,817,292 |
| S. Ujong, and | 897,130 | 864,082 |
| N. Sembilan | 137,876 | 144,679 |
| Pahang | 100,220 | 212,975 |

Area; Population, 1891; and Debt, 1894.

| Area | Population | Debt |
|------|------------|------|
| Pétrak | 7,751 | 214,254 |
| Selangor | 3,000 | 81,592 |
| S. Ujong, and | 1,860 | 28,602 |
| N. Sembilan | 1,200 | 41,617 |
| Pahang | 10,156 | 57,462 |

Railways.

Railway construction has made and is making rapid progress.

The following lines are open for traffic: in Pétrak from Port Weld, via Taiping, the capital, to Ulu Sa'petang 17 miles; from Teluk Anson to Ipoh 50 miles, and a small branch line to connect Lahat with the main line, 14 miles; in Selangor, from Klang, the chief port, to Kwala Lumpor, the capital, 22 miles; and from thence to Kwala Kubu 8¾ miles, with a small branch line from Kwala Lumpor to Sungai Besi, 9 miles; in Sungai Ujong, from Port Dickson to Seremban, the capital, 21 miles.

The following lines are under construction: in Pétrak, from Taiping to K. Kangsar, 12 miles; in Selangor, from Klang to the Coast, 6 miles; from Pudoh to Sungai Besi.

An important line has been surveyed to connect the East and West States of the Peninsula. If constructed, it will probably run from K. Kubu via Ulu Semangko or Ulu Kali to Kuala Lipis, in Pahang, a distance of 70 miles.

Pétrak.

Pétrak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the West Coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment to the Seychelles of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated with him.

The State is well watered, the Pétrak, Kinta, Krian, and Bernam being the chief rivers. The hills on the east boundary, being part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of 8,000 feet.

The chief export is tin. Sugar and rice are extensively grown, and tea and coffee plantations have been opened with success.

Larut and Kinta are the chief mining districts, the tin from the former being shipped at Port Weld, the port of Taiping, which is the headquarters of Government; and from the latter at Teluk Anson, a port at the mouth of the Pétrak River.

A battalion of Sikhs, recruited in India, performs the Police duties of the State.

Selangor.

Selangor adjoins Pétrak along its southern frontier. Its inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Pétrak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines. The State is drained by four rivers, the Bernam, Selangor, Klang, and Langat.

Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula, there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet, and one of 6,200 feet.

The chief town is Kwala Lumpor, which is the largest and best built town on the mainland of the Peninsula. It is connected by a railway with Klang, its port. Kwala Lumpor and Langat are the chief mining centres. Rice, coffee, pepper, and sugar are the principal agricultural products.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

The federal state of the Negri Sembilan, as at present constituted, dates from 1895; but a federation under that title already existed in the last
century. The present federation consists of six States, viz., S. Ujong, Sri Menanti, Jelebu, Johol, Rembau, and Tampin. The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban, and there are district officers at Port Dickson on the coast, K. Klawang in Jelebu, K. Pilah, and Tampin. A railway connects Seremban with Port Dickson.

The revenue is derived mainly from tin, which is found in all parts of the State. It is worked at present most successfully in the Seremban district and Jelebu. The miners are Chinese, the Malay population being almost entirely agricultural. Gold reefs are said to exist in Gemenekeh and on the Muar River. Coffee has been successfully cultivated, and there are many large tapioca estates. The cultivation of pepper and gambier is on the increase. A large part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Pahang.

Pahang, the largest of the Protected Native States, is the only one on the East Coast of the Peninsula. Its native rulers have for many years looked southward, formerly towards Johor and later to the Colony, for protection against their Northern neighbours.

Gunung Tahan, which is believed to be about 10,000 feet high, and therefore the highest summit in the Peninsula, has not yet been ascended.

Besides containing the highest summit, the State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jalat, and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan, and to the south the RUMPIN also debouch into the China Sea.

These rivers are unfortunately so shallow as to be navigable for only steam launches and other small craft, except in the rainy season; and during the North-East monsoon their mouths are very difficult of access.

The country is rich in gold, tin, and galena, and several companies under European or Australian direction are at work. The capital is Pekan, at the mouth of the Pahang River. A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Lipis in this state.
