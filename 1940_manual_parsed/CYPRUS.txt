CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the eastern-
most basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia
Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances
of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between
34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20'
and 34° 35' E. longitude. Famagusta, with a harbour
able to accommodate vessels up to 23 ft. draught,
is 295 miles from Egypt, while the port of Larnaca
on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said,
and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

Its area is 3,572 square miles, equal to Kent,
Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third
largest island in the Mediterranean, being only
exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest
length from west-south-west to east-north-east,
between Cape Drapano and Cape St. Andrea, is
about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north
to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are
the northern and southern mountain chains, and the
great plain of the Mesaoria extending between them
across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that
of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas
Mountains, and, towards their western extremity,
the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain
near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to
Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The
southern range, which is the more extensive and
lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-
western portions of the island, and trending thence
eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the
isolated peak called Sante Croce (or Stavrovouni),
about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit
of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the
sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the
summer quarters of the garrison, of the Governor,
and some of the principal officials.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain
torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The
principal are the Pedias and the Yalias.

History and Archaeology.

The history of Cyprus is too long and eventful
to be related here except in the briefest outline.
Recent excavations have carried knowledge of
prehistoric Cyprus back to the Neolithic Age, when
the Island was already widely populated, and have
shown that in the Second Millennium B.C. it must
have been an important centre of Aegean civilization.
Greek and Phoenician colonies were established at
an early date, and from the fusion of foreign and
indigenous elements arose a series of quasi in-
dependent kingdoms; these were the basis of the
political life of the Island under the successive rulers
down to Roman times. In the 6th century B.C. it
passed under the rule of Egypt, but in 525 B.C. it
joined Cambyses in his war against the Egyptians
and so was absorbed in the Persian Empire. The
whole island, with the exception of the Phoenician
town of Amathus, took part in the Ionian revolt in
502 B.C., but the Persians recovered possession in
about a year and at the battle of Salamis the fleet
of Xerxes included 160 Cypriote ships. At the end
of the 5th century the famous Evagoras of Salamis
established his supremacy over the whole island
and raised it for a brief period to a position of practical
independence, but after his death it again came under
the control of Persia. After the battle of the Issus,
Cyprus hastened to join Alexander the Great and
sent 120 ships to assist him in the siege of Tyre. At
the division of Alexander's Empire, the possession of
Cyprus was disputed by Syria and Egypt, but it
eventually passed to the latter. In 58 B.C. it became
a Roman province and was for a time joined to
Cilicia, during which period it was administered
by Cicero. Presented by Antony to Cleopatra, it
reverted to Rome on her death, and remained a
Roman province until the division of the Empire,
when it was assigned to the Eastern Emperor.
Its proximity to Syria exposed it to the assaults
of the Saracens, and it changed hands more than
once between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D. It
was finally recovered for Byzantium by Nicephorus
Phocas in 965, and remained attached to the Eastern
Empire until 1184. In that year its Governor,
Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself
Emperor of Cyprus. Isaac maintained his inde-
pendence until 1191, when Cyprus was con-
quered by Richard I. of England in revenge for
the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships
which had been wrecked on the island. Richard
sold the island first to the Order of the Temple
and later, when the Templars found the task of
government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan,
King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the
Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, but during
that period the Genoese Republic exercised a
ascendancy over part of the kingdom, from 1373
until 1464, by holding possession of the principal
port of Famagusta. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus
belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter
year the Turks conquered the island, and retained
possession of it until its cession to England in 1878
for administrative purposes. On the outbreak of
war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed
to the British Crown by Order in Council of the
5th of November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty
of Peace with Turkey signed at Lausanne on 24th
July, 1923, Turkey recognised the annexation.

On the 1st of May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed
under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the
island was formally elevated to the status of a
Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the
title of Governor.

Historical Monuments and Museums.

Neolithic, Bronze Age, Phoenician, Hellenic, and
Roman antiquities have been found in immense
quantities all over Cyprus from time immemorial, and
scientific explorations on a large scale have been
conducted in recent years by Swedish and American
Expeditions, and, on a smaller scale, by the
Antiquities Department. But it is more the ambition
of the present administration of antiquities to place
the numerous ancient sites and monuments in a
condition rendering them accessible and of greater
interest to the visitor than has hitherto been
attempted. Paphos, Salamis, Soli, and many other
places demand attention in order to preserve their
ancient character, now threatened by the island
becoming once more a centre of revived life and
activity. Salamis possesses the remains of probably
the largest market place ever built by the Romans,
foreshadowing perhaps the famous "Emporium
of the East" as Famagusta was called in the middle
ages. A Roman temple of the largest size at Nea-
Paphos lies in ruins which have never been explored
(mde Hogarth's "Devia Cypria," 1899).

The Museum Nicosia, built as a memorial to Queen
Victoria and much added to in recent years, contains
a unique collection of Cypriot pottery, sculpture,
gold and metal works of art, which was re-arranged
during the years 1935-1937 in accordance with the
most up-to-date methods of display. Separate
smaller collections, of the mediaeval architectural
fragments, which are always coming to light, have
been formed, and District Museums have recently
been established in Larnaca, Famagusta and Paphos.

The superb Gothic cathedrals and churches of
Nicosia and Famagusta, in their curious Eastern
surroundings, attract numerous visitors. These
buildings, of the finest type of French medieval art,
are singularly well preserved where they have been
converted into mosques; in other cases they are
interesting ruins. The conservation of this fine
series of Monuments is now the care of the recently
established Antiquities Department which has already
done much to make them secure and more attractive
to visitors.

The Venetian and Genoese Republics left few
traces of their rule in the island beyond the imposing
fortifications of the seaports of Famagusta, Kyrenia,
Paphos and Limassol, all of which are scheduled as
Ancient Monuments.

The number of Ancient Monuments in Cyprus
now protected by the Antiquities Law of 1935
amounts to 182, of which 77 are Government's
property. At several of the most important
monuments there are resident Custodians and
entrance fees are charged to visitors from outside
Cyprus.

Climate.

The mean temperature, as recorded in the screen at
Nicosia, for the last fifteen years is 66°7 F.; mean
maximum, 78°5° F.; mean minimum, 54°8° F.;
Highest shade temperature during that time 111° F.;
lowest 25° F.; Average rainfall for last ten years
20-58 inches. The year 1938 had a rainfall of 28-40
inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole island.
The rainy and cool season is from October to March.
The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in
summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on
the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the
temperature rarely falls below freezing point. Malarial
fevers are prevalent during the hot months, and if
the winter is mild, they occur throughout the year.
Sanitary improvements and plantations of trees
have, however, had a beneficial effect.

Population.

The population, excluding the military, in 1901
was 237,022; in 1911, 274,108; in 1921, 310,715;
and in 1931, 347,959.

The Moslems, who are all Ottoman Turks, form
about 18°46 per cent. of the population, the rest
being nearly all Christians of the Independent
Cypriote Church.

The Cypriote Church is a branch of and in com-
munion with the Orthodox Eastern Church, but is
"autocephalous"(i.e., The Archbishop of Cyprus is
not subordinate to any Patriarch). This position
of independence it has retained undisputed since
the 5th century when the Emperor Zeno finally
decided against the claims of the Patriarch of
Antioch to exercise authority over it.

Christianity was originally introduced into
the island by St. Paul and St. Barnabas, the
latter of whom, a Cypriote Jew by birth, was
martyred at Salamis.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 23,507
inhabitants; Larnaca, 11,725; Limassol, 15,066.
The two latter are open roadsteads. At Fam-
agusta, on the east, the harbour and quay space
have been considerably enlarged. The inner
harbour is dredged over an area of approxi-
mately 1,800 feet by 700 feet, to 24 feet at
low water (ordinary spring tides), with a channel
of approach 250 feet wide and 26 feet deep. The
curtain wall, south of Othello's Tower, has been
pierced with three arches, giving access from the
town to the quay. The quay is faced with a
concrete wall 1,770 feet long in 24 feet of water
and has road and rail access. Further accommo-
dation for sailing vessels and local craft has been
provided by means of a steel jetty 325 feet long by
20 feet wide with a depth of 15 feet at low water.
The port may be entered in safety both by night
and day. The town of Famagusta is little more
than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications
and the inhabitants are nearly all Moslems. The
Christian suburb of Varosia is built on more modern
lines. The combined population of Famagusta
and Varosia is 8,771. The four towns already
mentioned are the capitals of four of the six
administrative districts into which the island is
divided—the other two capitals being Ktima,
4,467, the modern capital of Paphos, on the south-
west, and Kyrenia, 2,049, where a small harbour
has been constructed, in the district of the same
name on the north coast, which has some trade
with the opposite coast of Karamania. A harbour
for small coasting vessels exists at Paphos, the
site of the ancient capital of that district. This
had become silted up and almost useless, but it has recently been dredged sufficiently to enable small sailing vessels to enter and lie in safety.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its copper mines, and today the principal mineral product is cuprous pyrites which is mined on a large scale by the Cyprus Mines Corporation in the Evrychou valley and near Lefka, with a crushing and concentrating plant at Morphou Bay where steamers call and load the ore. Cuprous pyrites is also produced at other localities, notably at Kalavaso in the south of the Island. Asbestos occurs on Mount Troodos where the Tunnel Asbestos Cement Company Ltd. has established quarries and mills for the production of fibre which is transported by aerial ropeway to the port of Limassol for shipment. Chrome iron ore is mined at Troodos by the Cyprus Chrome Co. Ltd.; it is transported by aerial ropeway to a crushing and concentrating plant near Kakopetria, the product being sent by road and rail to the port of Famagusta for shipment. Terra umbra (Turkey umber) is mined chiefly in the Larnaca district, and is carried by road to factories situated at Larnaca where burnt umber is prepared and exported. Gypsum, of which there are extensive beds in Cyprus, is quarried for local requirements, and there is a small export trade in both crude gypsum and plaster of paris.

The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, carobs, olives, wines, spirits and vinegar, tobacco and cigarettes, linseed, flax, sumach, silk, silk cocoons, wool, straw, hides and skins, cotton, cotton seed, cheese, potatoes, onions, raisins, grapes, oranges, lemons, mandarines, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, almonds, and hazel nuts; cattle, mules, donkeys, sheep, poultry and eggs are also exported.

Agriculture is dependent largely on irrigation, the water for which is obtained mainly from wells in the dry season and by flooding from streams during the rainy season. Agriculture has been greatly retarded by the deficient rainfall and the lack of water for irrigation. Drilling has, however, revealed the presence of underground water which is being developed; and, with the formation of a Water Supply and Irrigation Department as from 1939, it is hoped not only to continue the development of these underground supplies but also to impound and put to good and regulated use many surface supplies which are at present running to waste. It is also hoped gradually to introduce improved irrigation methods.

Special attention has been given in recent years to tobacco production. The itinerant Tobacco Instructors employed by the Government afford instruction to the peasant growers, and the efforts made have resulted in considerable improvement in the preparation of tobacco for the market.

A scheme for the improvement of cotton growing is being gradually put into force. The main object is to produce a grade of cotton readily marketable in the United Kingdom; an undertaking which necessitates, amongst other things, the control of cotton seed for sowing purposes and licensing of ginneries. The Cotton Law of 1937 was passed with a view to giving the Department of Agriculture wide powers for controlling the industry.

Cyprus wine, which has been famous from early times, has lately received a good deal of attention. It was formerly a domestic industry, and the wines produced consequently lacked uniformity in character and quality. Modern methods of manufacture have now been introduced and good light table wines are now on the market, owing mainly to the efforts of the Cyprus Wines and Spirits Co., Ltd., who have established modern wineries at Perapedhi, Mallia and Limassol. An effort is also being made to market Cyprus wines in the United Kingdom, and a Law has been enacted to prohibit the export to British Possessions of wines not coming up to the standards required. This, it is hoped, will secure recognition of the good wines produced in Cyprus and prevent the export of inferior wines, prejudicial to the marketing of the best Cyprus wines.

There has been steady expansion in the export of Cyprus oranges which, owing to their good quality, have found ready sale in the United Kingdom and continental markets, particularly those of the Scandinavian countries. The value of oranges exported in 1938 was £4,408, compared with £59,031 in 1934.

The improvement of agriculture is fostered by the Government Department of Agriculture, and technical assistance and advice is rendered by the Veterinary, Animal Husbandry, Entomological, Plant Pathological, Viticultural branches of the Department and by a field staff of itinerant Agricultural Officers.

A Central Experiment Farm has been established at Morphou and there is an Experimental Vineyard at Saitta, a Citrus Experimental Grove at Famagusta, a Deciduous Fruit Nursery at Trikoukiai and Nursery Gardens in suitable centres for the distribution of seeds and plants.

Considerable attention is given by the Government to animal husbandry. Cyprus is famous for its donkeys and mules. The Government maintains a stock farm at Athalassa and stud stables throughout the Island. Good breeds of cattle, horses and pigs are imported for the improvement of the local breeds. Good breeds of poultry are maintained by the Government for distribution. The export of cattle has increased and there is a steady demand for the best type of mules and donkeys.

The heavy tariff now imposed by the Egyptian Government on fruits has adversely affected the fruit export trade to Egypt and exporters are now unable to look to that market as an assured outlet for fruits and vegetables. In addition the economic difficulties encountered in marketing Cyprus produce in Central Europe have forced merchants to seek markets further afield. Such markets demand a higher standard of grading and packing before trade can be established on a permanent footing and in order to extend and encourage this trade to more distant markets a new Law known as the Agricultural Produce (Export) Law, 1933, has been brought into operation. Under this Law a Produce Inspection Service has been organised and Regulations for the inspection of Citrus Fruits, Potatoes and onions before export are enforced. Regulations for the inspection of other produce before export are contemplated.

In past years much injury was done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, were stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts were then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as the pits were topped with a zinc lining, they could not emerge. This system, as the locusts became more scattered, was discarded in favour of a system of collecting locust eggs and purchasing live locusts. Both the purchase and the spraying systems have been employed in recent years. The spraying system has latterly been replaced by the use of poisoned bran bait.
The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the depredations of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains a large number, and partly in consequence of past denudation and subsequent soil erosion.

Sponge fishing is carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek and Italian Islands. Sponge fishers are issued a licence at a nominal fee and the Government takes a duty in kind of 20% in the case of harpoon boats and 25% in the case of machine boats of the catch.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected by the local fishermen, who only use trammel nets and long line, but Italian and Greek trawlers work most of the year and fish is becoming more plentiful in the market than heretofore.

The chief imports are beans and peas, cement, coffee, edible oils, fertilizers, fish, flour, iron, leather, machinery, motor cars and chassis, petrol and petroleum, rice, sugar, textiles, timber and tobacco; the exports are chiefly animals, artificial teeth, carobs, cheese, citrus and other fruit, corn and grain, cotton, cuminseed, embroidery and needlework, onions, potatoes, raisins, tobacco, wines and spirits, wool and mining and quarry products, viz., asbestos, cuprous concentrates, cuprous pyrites, metallic residues, terra umbra and yellow ore.

The Customs import duties are mostly on a specific basis. The ad valorem duties vary from 7 to 40 per cent.

A preference is granted on most classes of imports from British sources.

The following is the percentage of trade with the United Kingdom, other parts of the British Empire and the principal foreign countries:

| Country                  | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| United Kingdom           | 32-37      |

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1901, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign. Silver, 18, 9, 4½, 3 piastre pieces, limit of tender 540 piastres (nine equal to one shilling). Bronze, 1 piastre, half piastre, quarter piastre, limit of tender, 27 piastres (40 paras = 1 piastre). By a proclamation dated the 7th of January, 1936, bronze coins, with the exception of the quarter piastre piece, are in course of withdrawal from circulation and are being replaced by cupro-nickel coins of the same denominations. By proclamation of 28th April, 1928, a new silver 45-piastre piece is current and legal tender in the colony as from that date. Currency Notes were issued from time to time from September, 1914, as a war measure. Notes of the following denominations are in circulation:—£1, £2, 10s. By an Order-in-Council of 1st November, 1928, the Treasurer as "Commissioner" of Currency was authorised to issue Currency Notes of the Government; such Notes are to be legal tender, and provision was made for the conversion of the Notes into sterling and vice versa, and for the establishment of a Note Security Fund.

The Ottoman Bank has branches at Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos, also at Troödos during summer season.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Limited has branches at Nicosia, Limassol, and Famagusta, also at Troödos during the summer season.

The Bank of Athens has branches at Limassol and Nicosia, with Correspondents at Larnaca, Famagusta and Paphos.

The Ionian Bank has a branch at Nicosia, agencies at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos, and Correspondents at Kyrenia and Morphou.

The Bank of Cyprus has its Head Office at Nicosia, agencies at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Paphos, Kyrenia and Morphou.

The Agricultural Bank of Cyprus, Limited, which operates under a Government Guarantee, was established in 1925, with Head Offices at Nicosia. It lends money to farmers through the medium of Co-operative Credit Societies or direct to individuals.

Other banks operating in Cyprus are Bank of Larnaca, Limited and Emmiet Bank, Limited with Head Offices at Larnaca; Peoples Bank, Limassol, Limited, with Head Office at Limassol; Famagusta Bank, Limited, with Head Office at Famagusta; Popular Bank of Paphos, Limited, and Melissa Bank, Limited, with Head Offices at Paphos.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oke=2'8lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum=about ¼ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

The Cyprus Government Railway of 2' 6" gauge extended originally from Famagusta Harbour to the Capital, Nicosia, and then to Morphou and up to the foot-hills of Troödos at Evrychou.

Owing to uneconomic results the Section from Kalokhorion to Evrykhou was taken up and the remaining Section Nicosia to Kalokhorion closed to scheduled traffic.

There is no navigable waterway in the island. The main and secondary roads have recently been reconstructed and good roads exist between all important centres. Most villages are connected with these roads by cart roads. There are motor car services between the chief towns of each district. The Famagusta harbour was completed in 1906, and...
was enlarged in 1929-33 with assistance from the Colonial Development Fund. An extension to the pier at Larnaca with a sheltering arm at the sea end was completed in 1909. The ancient harbour at Paphos and the harbour at Kyrenia are of sufficient depth to admit of their use by the small coastal craft that trade between Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor and Cyprus. There are no Government telegraphs, other than those along the railway. Telecommunication services are conducted by Cable and Wireless Limited whose extensive telegraph and telephone network connects the towns and larger villages of the Colony. The Company's cables from Egypt and Palestine are landed at Larnaca whence the six principal towns are connected by landlines. During the summer season telegraph and telephone offices are open at Pedhoulas, Prodromos and Troodos. The Company owns and operates the coast station and aeradio station at Larnaca for communication with ships and aircraft respectively. Emergency wireless communication with neighbouring countries is available should the cables become interrupted.

A weekly mail service is maintained between Egypt and Cyprus by subsidised steamers of the Khedivial S.S. Company. Steamers of the "Adriatica" Navigation Company of Venezia call weekly from Italy en route for Palestine and Syria on the outward voyage, and from Syria and Palestine on the homeward voyage to Italy (Fast Line). Steamers of the same Company call fortnightly (a) from Italy via Greece, Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Mersina on the outward voyage en route for Rhodes, Greece and Italy; (b) from Italy via Greece en route for Mersina, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Italy; and (c) from Italy via Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Mersina en route for Izmir and Italy. Since the outbreak of war, however, steamers of this Company have called at irregular intervals at Cyprus ports. Steamers of the Hellenic Coast Line Company of Piraeus call fortnightly from Greece direct en route for Syria and vice versa; and steamers of the "Service Maritime Roumain" of Bucharest call fortnightly from Romania (via Istanbul and Greece) en route for Palestine and Syria on their outward voyage, and from Syria and Palestine on their homeward voyage to Roumania (via Greece and Istanbul). Mail for Arabia, North-West India, Iraq and Iran are forwarded weekly to Jaffa for onward transmission by the Overland Mail Service Palestine-Iraq; and mails destined for countries served by the England-India-Malaya (Australia) or the England-South Africa Air Mail services are despatched weekly to Palestine and Egypt, respectively, by the ordinary route for onward transmission by air.

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal Colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the Colony. Money Orders and British Postal Orders are also issued and paid in the Colony. "Cash on Delivery" parcels for delivery within the Colony are accepted and delivered at the principal post offices. A reciprocal service of "Cash on Delivery" of parcels has been established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom, Egypt and the Sudan.

**Education: (a) Elementary.**

A general system of grants in-aid of elementary schools was established in 1882, and further regulated by various laws up to 1929, when Government assumed the chief responsibility for elementary education. In 1933 the Governor became the central authority for all matters connected with elementary education, including the appointment and discipline of teachers and control of books and curriculum. Teachers' salaries and gratuities on retirement are paid by the Government, but the provision and maintenance of schools is met from local rates, with assistance from Education Funds under Government control.

There are separate schools for each religious community, i.e., Orthodox-Christian, about 81 per cent. of the population, Moslem, about 18 per cent., and smaller communities of Armenians, Maronites, and Latin Catholics. For each community there is a Board of Education with advisory functions and control over the amounts to be raised by local rates.

Government elementary schools provide a six years' course from the age of 6. Education is free and voluntary. The following are the statistics of schools, teachers and pupils for the school year 1937-38:

**Orthodox-Christians:** Schools, 492 (boys' 37, girls' 36, mixed 419); pupils 37,646 (boys 21,434, girls 16,212); teachers 957 (masters 622, mistresses 335).

**Moslem:** Schools, 213 (boys' 28, girls' 27, mixed 158); pupils 7,483 (boys 4,440, girls 3,063); teachers 252 (masters 213, mistresses 45).

**Others:** Schools 16 (boys' 3, girls' 1, mixed 12); pupils 1,312 (boys 610, girls 702); teachers 73 (masters 26, mistresses 47).

The total expenditure on education (primary and secondary) for the year 1937-38 was 197,362L, of which 120,137L was from Colonial Revenue.

**(b) Secondary.**

Under the Secondary Education Law, 1935, all Schools above the primary standard are required to be registered and open to inspection, and all teachers in them are licensed. There are about 50 such schools. Strict conditions, relating to management, finance, staff, curriculum and teaching conditions, are imposed on schools in receipt of grants from Government.

Among the most important schools are: for Moslems—a boys' Lycee and girls' High School in Nicosia, administered by a Governing Body constituted under the law, and supported by Government and Evcaf grants and by fees; for Orthodox-Christians—6 Gymnasiums (classical): (1 for boys, 1 for girls, 4 mixed) and 2 High Schools for girls in the towns, and a Commercial Lyceum at Larnaca, all managed by local committees appointed under...
the Law; 5 high schools in the larger villages, managed by local elected committees; private commercial schools in Nicosia, Famagusta and Limassol, and a commercial school with private endowments at Lemythou; Latin (Catholic)—a boys' school in Nicosia and convents in Nicosia, Larnaca and Limassol; undenominational—the English School, Nicosia, administered by a Board of Management on behalf of the Governor and now reorganised with a largely English staff; and the American Academies (for boys and girls at Larnaca, for girls at Nicosia) managed by the Reformed Presbyterian Mission. The Armenian elementary schools have secondary classes attached to them. There are also a considerable number of small private schools, mainly for teaching English, in towns and villages. Many of the boys' schools admit girls also.

The total enrolment in secondary schools is about 4,690.

Elementary schoolmasters receive their training at the Normal School, Morphou, which was opened in November, 1937. It is situated on the grounds of the Agricultural Department's Central Experiment Farm at Morphou, and provides a practical and theoretical training in Agriculture, suitable to rural conditions in Cyprus, as part of a two-year course in education.

There is no training college for elementary schoolmistresses.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation.

On the 14th of August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

The island was annexed to and became part of His Majesty's dominions by an Order in Council of the 5th of November, 1914.

Government

Up to the 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent bearing date 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official Members and fifteen elected Members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and twelve by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island these clauses of the Letters Patent, dated 10th March, 1925, which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated the 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor.

The island, for administrative purposes, is divided into six districts namely:—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Paphos and Kyrenia. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

This division (which formed the basis of the original judicial system of the Colony under the Courts Order-in-Council of 1882, but was abandoned under the Order of 1927 in favour of three judicial divisions, each comprising two districts) was readopted by the new Courts Law, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1936. By this Law the Courts were reorganised in the light of the experience afforded by the working of the system in force under the Order of 1927, and the re-organisation may be described as a blend of that system with the system obtaining under the Order of 1882.

The new Law provides for:—

(1) A Supreme Court, consisting of a Chief Justice and two or more Puisne Judges, with appellate jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, over the decisions of all other Courts, and original jurisdiction as a Colonial Court of Admiralty under the Imperial Act of 1890 and in matrimonial causes, with powers in such causes similar to those of the High Court in England; when hearing appeals the Court is constituted by three or two judges, as the Chief Justice may determine; but in criminal appeals leave to appeal is granted or refused absolutely by a single Judge. A single judge exercises the original jurisdiction of the Court. In civil matters where the amount or value in dispute is 300l. or over an appeal lies from the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council. The Supreme Court may also in its discretion grant leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council from any other judgment which involves a question of great general or public importance.

(2) Six Assize Courts, one for each district, with unlimited criminal jurisdiction and power to order compensation up to 300l. These Courts are constituted by a Judge of the Supreme Court sitting with a President of a District Court and a District Judge or with two District Judges. This bench of three is nominated by the Chief Justice whenever a sitting is to be held.

(3) Six District Courts, one for each district, consisting of a President and such District Judges and Magistrates (previously called Assistant District Judges) as the Chief Justice may from time to time direct. There are at present three Presidents (each in charge of two district Courts, namely Nicosia and Kyrenia, Famagusta and Larnaca, and Limassol and Paphos, respectively), nine District Judges, and six Magistrates. The District Courts exercise original civil and criminal jurisdiction, the extent of which depends upon the bench constituting the Court.

(I) In Civil matters (other than those within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) a President and one or two District Judges sitting together have unlimited jurisdiction; a President or a District Judge sitting alone has jurisdiction up to 200l., and a Magistrate up to 25l. (which the Governor may increase to 50l.). The jurisdiction of a member of the Court sitting alone to try an action on the merits is determined by the amount or value actually in dispute between the parties as disclosed at the settlement of issues or upon the pleadings. But any member of the Court can in any action, even though beyond his power to try, settle issues, or make an order not disposing of the action on the merits, or give judgment when the defendant fails to appear or admits the claim. A President has also power to hear appeals from decisions of Magistrates in actions where the amount in dispute does not exceed 25l. (or 50l. in case of a Magistrate whose jurisdiction has been increased to this amount).

(II) In criminal matters the jurisdiction of a District Court is exercised by its members sitting
singly, and is of a summary character. A President has power to try any offence punishable with imprisonment up to three years or with fine up to £100l. or with both, and may order compensation up to £100l.; a District Judge has power to try any offence punishable with imprisonment up to one year or with fine up to £100l. or with both, and may order compensation up to £50l.; and a Magistrate has power to try any offence punishable with imprisonment up to six months or with fine up to £25l. or both, and may order compensation up to £25l. Subject to these limits of punishment which the members of the Court cannot exceed, a President or a District Judge may also try any offence punishable with imprisonment up to five years if the Attorney-General and the person accused consent; a District Judge may (with, in prosecutions conducted by a Law Officer or a Police Officer, his consent) also try certain offences punishable with imprisonment up to three years; and a Magistrate may (with the like consent in such prosecutions) try a few offences punishable up to three years. In addition, every member of a District Court has power to hold a preliminary enquiry into an offence not summarily triable and commit the accused person for trial by an Assize Court.

The jurisdiction above described may be exercised over Cypriots and non-Cypriots, but the Law expressly states that it does not confer any jurisdiction upon the Courts it establishes to hear any matrimonial cause where either party is a member of the Greek-Orthodox Church and the marriage was celebrated in accordance with its rites, or where either party is a member of the Mussulman faith and the marriage was contracted in accordance with the Sheri Law, or to hear any other matter which, under the principles of the Ottoman Law previously in force in the Colony was cognizable by an ecclesiastical tribunal, or which is within the jurisdiction of a Mussulman religious tribunal pursuant to any enactment in force for the time being.

The reconstituted Courts are to apply the local Laws and certain Ottoman Legislation specified in the new Courts Law, the common Law, and the rules of equity in force in England on 5th November, 1914 (the date of the Colony's annexation) in the absence of provision in the local Laws, and any Statutes of the Imperial Parliament applicable to the colonies in general or to Cyprus in particular save in so far as they may be validly modified or other provision made by local Law. The family Law of the various religious communities which had received legal recognition under Turkish rule is expressly saved. They are also to apply the English Law and rules of evidence in force on the date of the annexation if there is no local provision in that respect. And their practice and procedure shall, in the absence of local provision, be that observed by the Courts in England.

As above stated, the jurisdiction conferred by the 1927 Order in Council on the Mussulman religious tribunals it created has been saved. There continue to be three such tribunals—one for Nicosia and Kyrenia, another for Famagusta and Larnaca, and the third for Limassol and Paphos—and their jurisdiction is, as before, over persons of the Mussulman faith in matters of marriage, divorce, maintenance in relation thereto, inheritance and succession, wills and their registration, and the registration of vakfschs. But the Sheri tribunal of Appeal created by that Order has been abolished by an amending Law, which empowers the Supreme Court to hear appeals from those tribunals with, if it so wishes, the Fetva Emini (a Moslem religious dignitary) as assessor.

The strength of the police force is 24 officers and 702 men, while the Prison Service consists of 3 officers and 80 men. Both services consist of mixed Christians and Moslems.

Finances.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Immovable Property Tax.
2. Animal Taxes.
3. An excise on tobacco.
4. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.
5. Salt monopoly.
6. Import duties.
7. Shipping and Wharfage dues.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished.

Grants in aid have been received from the British Government annually since 1897. From 1911-12 the grant was fixed at £50,000 a year, and since 1928, it has been increased to the fixed rate of £92,800 a year. A contribution of £10,000 a year has, from the latter date, been made by the Colony towards the cost of Imperial Defence.

FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Montevideo. They consist of East Falkland Island and West Falkland Island, which, with the adjacent islands, have an estimated area of 2,580 square miles and 2,038 square miles respectively.

There are two groups of dependencies (i) South Georgia with South Orkney and South Sandwich, the boundaries being the 50th parallel of south latitude and the 20th and 50th meridians of west longitude (ii) South Shetland and Graham Land bounded by the parallel of latitude 58° S., and the meridians of longitude 50° and 80° W.

The island of South Georgia lies about 800 miles to the east of the Falkland Islands, South Orkney and South Sandwich being about 450 miles to the south-west and south-east respectively of South Georgia. The northern point of South Shetland is about 500 miles to the south of the Falklands.

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1764 Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis in East Falkland. The French settlement was taken over by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1766.

In 1765 Captain Byron took possession of West Falkland, and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770; this action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the British garrison in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774 and no further formal occupation was made until 1820, when the Republic of Buenos Aires established a settlement in the East Falkland which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 occupation of the islands was resumed by the British Government. Until 1843, they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making Admiralty surveys. In 1843, a Civil Administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis until the following year when they were removed to Stanley, then known as Port William.

The colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 until 1880 and for a mail service until 1884-5, since which year the colony has been self-supporting.

South Georgia and the South Sandwich group were discovered in 1775 by Captain James Cook, who took possession of them for Britain. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain William Smith in 1819, and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821.

The dependencies were visited only by exploring expeditions, sealers, and whalers until the rise of the modern whaling industry in those regions.

General Description.

(a) Falkland Islands.

The Falkland Islands have a very deeply indented coast line and many good natural harbours. The surface is hilly, attaining its maximum elevation of 2,318 feet in Mount Adam, West Falkland.
The entire country is covered with wild moorland interrupted by outcrops of rock and the peculiar collections of angular boulders named "stone runs."

There is no cultivation except in the immediate vicinity of the settlements and shepherds' houses where vegetables and in a few places hay is grown. The soil is chiefly peat but considerable areas of sand also occur.

Communication is maintained by sea and horses, but there are no roads beyond the immediate vicinity of Stanley, the traveller being guided by natural landmarks. A commencement has been recently made to indicate recognized tracks with direction posts. Trees are completely absent.

The only town is Stanley in East Falkland, with a population of about 1,200. The houses are mostly iron and wood, built as they are required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house but there are several boarding houses affording fair accommodation. Stanley is a port of register and had, on the 31st December, 1937, 26 vessels aggregating 32,589 tons.

The cost of mutton is 3d. per lb., of beef 4d., fowls' eggs when procurable cost 2½d. to 3d. each, while penguin eggs in spring are sold at a price varying from 4s. to 8s. 6d. per hundred. Milk is priced at 1s. per quart. Most foodstuffs have to be imported.

Climate and Health.

In the Falklands the temperature is uniformly low, ranging from 40° to 65° in summer and from 30° to 50° in winter, with an annual mean of 42°.

The annual rainfall seldom exceeds 25 inches, and although snow falls frequently it does not as a rule lie long. In summer the atmosphere is very dry and evaporation rapid.

The Climate is very healthy though somewhat trying to people from the United Kingdom owing to the constant high winds in summer. Weather conditions are definitely more pleasant in winter than they are in the greater part of England. The conditions of living generally are of a reasonably good standard though limited resources and horizons render the country unsuitable for persons of a neurasthenic tendency. An adequate variety of diet is obtainable and the quality of the food is very fair. Good vegetables can be grown and fruit is procured from Monte Video. The birth rate in 1937 was 15:48 and the death rate 8:36 per 1,000 respectively.

(b) Dependencies.

The island of South Georgia is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, while the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea. There is a coastal fringe free from snow in summer and more or less clothed with vegetation, including tussock "grass." Land whaling stations have been established in five of the numerous bays.

The remaining dependencies are even more inhospitable, being nearly completely covered with snow and ice and almost entirely destitute of plant life. All the dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

A Land Station is equipped at Deception Island, in the South Shetland group, and another in the South Orkneys, but neither has operated within recent years.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

The inhabitants of the Falkland Islands are almost entirely occupied in sheep farming, the whole acreage of the colony being divided into large sheep runs. Wool is the principal product but tallow and hides are also exported. There were in 1937, 604,346 sheep, 10,076 cattle and 3,387 horses in the islands.

Seal oil is also produced for export by a company formed in 1928.

The whaling field of the dependencies, in which whaling by modern methods was first carried on in 1904, has become more productive than all those in the rest of the world combined; a small quantity of seal oil is also produced.

Dependencies exports during 1938 amounted to 462,912L. Of this total 205,728L. or 71 per cent. was consigned to the British Empire. Norway's share amounted to 36,220L., and nearly all the rest went to the Canary and Cape Verde Islands en route to other European countries.

An expedition for research, mainly into whaling, for which the ships "Discovery II" and "William Scoresby" have been acquired, has been operating in the southern seas.

In the case of the Colony proper, exports amounted to 200,706L.; over 90 per cent. went to the United Kingdom.

In the case of the Colony proper, 73 per cent. of the imports came from the British Empire; in the case of the Dependencies 32:37 per cent. (excluding importations from the high seas for re-exportation) came from the British Empire, mainly from the United Kingdom.

The Customs duties are all specific and are levied on spirits, wines, beer, tobacco and matches (import) and on wool, whale oil, seal oil and guano (export). They are non-preferential except that matches of British manufacture are admitted free, and that the import duty on tobacco and cigarettes produced and manufactured in any part of the British Empire is at nine-tenths of the ordinary rate.

Education.

There are two schools in Stanley. A Government school is maintained from public funds, which, whilst being elementary in character, makes provision for attendance at a Continuation Class for a two years' course of further education. There is also a Convent School managed by Roman Catholic Sisters; this school, however, is not subject to Government control, and receives no subsidy.

The Government contributes two-thirds of the cost of the board and lodging of children from the country districts attending school in Stanley.

Four travelling teachers are provided by the Government and two by the Falkland Islands Company. These teachers travel from Settlement to Settlement devoting a certain amount of time to each. The number of children receiving education in the Colony in 1937 was 387.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and local 5L., 1L., and 10s. notes. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established, in which, on 30th September, 1938, the deposits were 200,400L., belonging to 1,085 depositors.
The Falkland Islands Company, Limited.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This, however, was not found profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, in shipping, and in the importation of goods.

The company maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin, and contributes to the provision of a salary for a clergyman of the Church of England.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Stanley and the outside world is effected principally through Montevideo, to which port a service is maintained in accordance with actual requirements by the s.s. "Lafonia," a vessel of some 1,800 tons dead weight belonging to the Falkland Islands Company, Limited, and running on a mail contract for a period of five years from January, 1937.

The distance from Stanley to Montevideo is rather more than 1,000 miles and the time taken on the voyage by the s.s. "Lafonia" averages four days. The average time occupied in the transit of mails to and from the United Kingdom, via Montevideo, is 28 days. Opportunities for the receipt and despatch of mails are available every four weeks.

Communication with South Georgia is maintained by the Falkland Islands Company's s.s. "Lafonia," which makes two voyages between Stanley and the Dependency during the year. The time occupied on the voyage in either direction averages three days.

The inter-isular service for mails and passengers is maintained by coasting steamers belonging to the Falkland Islands Company, Limited.

Letters.

Two wireless stations for external traffic are maintained by the Government, one at Stanley and one at Cumberland Bay, Grytviken, in the Dependency of South Georgia. A smaller station at Fox Bay on the West Falkland is maintained also by the Government for inter-isular communication. The Stanley Station operated by the Government communicates direct with the Great Britain station of Cable and Wireless Limited whence telecommunication channels connect with countries all over the world. The Government Station also communicates with Cerrito, Uruguay. The principal farm stations on East Falkland Island are connected by telephone with the Stanley exchange and those on West Falkland Island with the Government headquarters at Fox Bay.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council composed of five official members and 2 unofficial members, and a Legislative Council composed of four official and four unofficial members. The unofficial members of the Legislative Council are appointed by Warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet for a term not exceeding five years.
