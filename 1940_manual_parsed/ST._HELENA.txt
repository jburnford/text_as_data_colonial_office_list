ST. HELENA.

Situation, Area, &c.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 700 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of Africa, in 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. It is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from England, 14 days, and from Capetown, 5 days.

A census taken in April, 1931, showed a population of 3,995, of whom 48 were members of the Garrison.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population in April, 1931, of 1,381. The climate is mild and varies little, the thermometer in Jamestown ranging in summer between 68° and 84°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall for the years 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, was 41-55, 33-26, 29-18, 101-53 and 95-08 inches respectively. The island is very healthy. The death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants was for 1935, 10-42, for 1936, 15-20, for 1937, 7-27, and for 1938, 13-63; and the birth-rate per 1,000 inhabitants was for 1935, 34-73, for 1936, 30-87, for 1937, 29-07, and for 1938, 37-55.
History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander, Juan de Nova Castella, May, 1602. The Portuguese appear to have kept the situation of the island a secret from other European nations until 1688, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. After Captain Cavendish's visit, the island became a port of call for ships of various nations voyaging between the East Indies and Europe. In 1633, Jacques Spez formally annexed it on behalf of the States General; but no attempt to occupy it was made by the Dutch. It was annexed and occupied by Captain John Dutton, who was sent out by the East India Company for the purpose with an expedition which arrived at St. Helena on 5th May, 1639. The first official authorisation of the Company's occupation occurs in a Charter dated 1661. In January, 1673, the Dutch seized it, but they were driven out in May by Captain Munden, of the English Navy. A Charter was issued by Charles II to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company till 22nd April, 1834, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.

The Government maintain 3 schools, having 332 scholars. There are also 5 endowed and private day schools, all aided by Government, having 480 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 11 of 1903, and fees of 1d. a week per child are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for the year 1938 was £1,042l. and £1,023l. respectively.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the Red Sea route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818 a law was passed that all future children born in the Island should be free.

Apart from supplying provisions to ships, the Island has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre (phormium tenax). The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost the yield was only about three tons of fibre, though, under present conditions of working, ten tons of phormium leaves give one ton of fibre and a quarter ton of tow. The industry was re-started with the help of a grant from the Home Exchequer. The Government Mill was opened in 1907, and is now on lease to Messrs. Solomon & Co., of this Colony.

A small industry, that of the export of Lily Bulbs to England, has been started, and there is every prospect of it proving of benefit to the Colony, particularly to small growers.

There are now five mills operating in the Island, the amount of fibre and tow exported in 1938 being 284 and 199½ tons respectively. A rope and twine industry was also established in 1926, the amount of rope and twine exported during 1938 being 14 tons.

In 1932 the land under cultivation of flax was estimated at 3,000 acres. There has been no further development of the industry.

A lace-making industry was established in August, 1907, with the help of a grant from Imperial funds.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war, was 44 in 1938. It is a port of registry.

The chief industries are phormium fibre, lace-making, aloe and bead work, fishing and agriculture, the main arable crop being phormium tenax.

The Government savings bank was established in 1865 (the amount standing to the credit of depositors on 31st December, 1938, was £24,701.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at par.

There are excellent facilities for the supply of coal and water to ships.

There are preferential and general customs tariffs, the duties being mainly ad valorem. A number of essential commodities, such as flour, rice, etc., are exempt from duty if they are the growth, produce or manufacture of the British Empire.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England at regular intervals of 4 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal, steamers arrive from thence at the same interval and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 14 days. The rate of postage to the U.K., India, and British Possessions is 2½d. for the first oz. and 1½d. for each additional ounce; to other parts of the world 3½d. for the first oz. and 1½d. for each additional ounce. There is no internal post, but there are approximately 75 miles of telephone lines, constructed by the Colonial Government with the assistance of a loan from the Colonial Development Fund of £475l. Cable and Wireless Limited owns and operates a cable station whence cables connect with Cape Town and Ascension, thus linking the Colony with all parts of the world through the Company's system.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of His Majesty in Council.
