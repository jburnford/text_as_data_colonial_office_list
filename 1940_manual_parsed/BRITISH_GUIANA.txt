In 1928, by an Act of Parliament, it was enacted that it should be lawful for His Majesty in Council to create and constitute, in substitution for the existing Legislature, a Legislature for the Colony of British Guiana in such form and with such powers as His Majesty in Council might determine, and from time to time to alter and amend the constitution of the Legislature and any powers thereof; and that any such Order in Council might provide that, notwithstanding the powers conferred on the Legislature thereby, there should be reserved to or conferred on His Majesty full power by Order in Council from time to time to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony of British Guiana.

Pursuant to this Act, an Order of the King in Council providing for the Government of the Colony and for the constitution of a Legislative Council, was brought into operation on 18th July, 1928. The Court of Policy and Combined Court were thereby abolished and their powers were given to the new Legislative Council. The new Council consists of the Governor as President, of ten Official Members and of nineteen Unofficial Members. The Colonial Secretary and Attorney-General are ex-officio members, and of the nineteen unofficial members, fourteen are elected and the remainder nominated by the Governor. The persons who were elected members of the Combined Court became under the Order in Council...
the first Elected Members of the Legislative Council. It was also provided that any matter requiring a vote of enactment of the Council might be decided by the Governor in Executive Council notwithstanding that such decision might be contrary to the vote of a majority of the Legislative Council; but in such a case effect cannot be given to the decision until the facts have been reported to the Secretary of State and his approval obtained. The second General Election under the new Constitution was held in 1936.

An Amending Order of the King in Council was brought into force on 13th August, 1935. This order amends the Principal Order with respect to the qualifications of voters and makes additional provision to counteract corrupt and illegal practices committed in reference to elections.

Law.

The Roman-Dutch law was in force in the Colony until 1st January, 1917, at which date the Civil Law of British Guiana Ordinance came into force. This enactment, along with two others, was the outcome of a Common Law Commission and Statute Law Committee. The Criminal Law is based upon that of Great Britain and is administered in the same manner. Indictments are preferred by the Attorney-General.

Local Government.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated. The principle has now been materially extended in its application.

The existing municipal authorities are:—Mayor and town council, Georgetown; and mayor and town council, New Amsterdam. Their revenue in 1938 was respectively £150,740l. and £21,372l., and their expenditure £144,829l. and £22,447l. There are also 25 village districts and 63 country districts whose revenue and expenditure in 1938 were respectively £31,287l. and £20,066l.

Communications—Internal and External.

The three rivers, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, are navigable for 90, 35, and 150 miles respectively. Beyond these distances, owing to the nature of the country, they abound in cataracts and waterfalls. There is a good network of roads, and there are small canals in connection with the Demerara River. There is a railway from Georgetown to Roseignol on the Berbice River, 60½ miles in length, and one from Vreed-en-Hoop on the Demerara River to Parika on the Essequibo River, 18½ miles in length, both lines having been constructed by the Demerara Railway Company at a total cost of £604,621l. 8s. ld. The Railways were acquired by the Colony from the Company in 1921 as from the 1st January, 1919, and are now operated by Government in conjunction with certain steamer services under the control of the Transport and Harbours Department. The steamers operate ferries across the Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo Rivers and services from Georgetown to Adventure on the Essequibo Coast to Bartica at the junction of the Mazaruni and Essequibo Rivers, to Morawhanna in the North-West District and to Pickersgill on the Pomeroon River and also from New Amsterdam to Paradise on the Berbice River. Launch services are also run by the Department on the Canje, and Pomeroon-Moruka Rivers.

Motor transport services are also operated from the steamer terminus at Bartica to Garraway Stream on the Potaro River, and to Issano on the Mazaruni River.

A steamer service is also operated from Georgetown to Wismar on the Demerara River by Messrs. Sprostons Limited.

A number of roadways and trails are maintained by Government in the interior to serve mining and other areas.

The roads suitable for motor traffic are:—

(a) From Bartica, the steamer terminus on the Essequibo River, to the Minnehaha River at 118 miles, crossing the Potaro river by a 360 feet span suspension bridge at 100½ miles.

(b) A Branch Road from the above (a) at 73½ miles to Issano Landing at Mazaruni River, a distance of 50½ miles.

(c) A Branch Road from (a) at 89 miles to Tumatumari on the Essequibo River, a distance of 4 miles.

(d) A Branch Road from (c) at 102 miles to Kangaruma on the Potaro River, a distance of 4 miles.

The object of the above road and its branches is to render the districts concerned accessible by road transport from Bartica instead of by the slow and dangerous navigation of rivers impeded by falls and rapids.

The Bartica-Potaro Road (c) and its branch to Kangaruma are also part of the present day route to the Kaieteur Fall.

(e) The Camaria Portage, a roadway 3¼ miles in length, side-tracking the series of falls and rapids on the Ouyuni river known as the Camaria Falls.

(f) The Morawhanna-Wanaina Road, a road 6½ miles in length from the left bank of the Barima river opposite Morawhanna via the Government Station at Maharamu to the Government Experiment Station at Hosoro Hill, and with a branch road to the Aruka River at Kumaka Creek, ¾ mile in length.

The following trails are passable to pedestrians, horses and pack animals.

The Rupununi Cattle Trail, 299 miles in length, from Takama on the Berbice River via Kurupukari to Dadanawa on the Rupununi River.

The Barima-Barama Trail, 29 miles in length between Arakaka on the Barima River and Towakaima on the Barama River.

In addition to these trails there is a large mileage of forest trails suitable for foot traffic only serving sections of the mining areas and by-passing falls and rapids in the rivers. Examples of the latter are the portages at Amatuk Falls and Waratuk Falls, on the Potaro River, by which travel to the Kaieteur Fall is made possible.

The Georgetown wireless station, owned and operated by Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited, is in communication with ships at sea and stations outside the Colony, and a direction-finding station is also maintained. The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Barbados, and thence with Canada and North America over this Company's cables. From Canada, communication with Great Britain and other parts of the world is maintained over the system of Cable and Wireless Limited.

The Pan American Airways operates a radio station under Government licence in Georgetown for communication with aircraft and certain ground stations overseas.

There is an up-to-date Postal Telephone Service in the Colony with Exchanges in Georgetown, New Amsterdam and nine of the larger villages, including four semi-automatic exchanges.
Two separate police exchanges are maintained, one in Georgetown and one in New Amsterdam.

A full automatic exchange was opened at Georgetown on 29th June, 1928.

Length of telephone trunk lines 787 miles. Telephone lines in Exchange areas, 5,347 miles. Aerial cables 13½ miles. Submarine cables 22 miles.

An efficient Postal Telegraph Service, connected by 317 miles of line and the above-mentioned submarine cables is maintained between 48 Post Offices on the coast lands from Skeldon on the Courantyne River to Charity on the Pomeroon River, and is extended to six district stations in the interior by radio through a central Post Office radio station in Georgetown.

A well-organised postal service extends throughout the colony, letters reaching Pomeroon in 10 hours from Georgetown, and the North-Western District in 24 hours. Georgetown and New Amsterdam are lighted by electricity.

The mail communication between the Colony and the United Kingdom is somewhat irregular, but nevertheless there are many opportunities.

The steamers of the Harrison Bookers and Dutch Surinam Lines are used, also via Trinidad:

French—Plymouth and St. Nazaire Line.
Dutch—Colon Line.
German—Hamburg-American Horn Line.

Mails for North America are received and despatched fairly regularly by the following steamers:

Canadian National Steamships, Ocean Dominion, Furness Bermuda Line, American Caribbean, and via Trinidad by Prince Munson Lines, and by the aeroplanes of the Pan American Airways, Incorporated.

There is also an Air Mail Service with the United Kingdom via Natal, Dakar and Paris. The approximate time of transmission from Georgetown to London by this route is 6 days.

### Industry and Trade.

The staple products of British Guiana are sugar, rum, molasses, molascuit, concentrated lime juice, rice, coconuts, coconut-oil, copra, coffee, balata and rubber. Sugar and rice are the chief industries of the Colony. Sugar and its by-products furnish 64 per cent. in value of the total exports. Timber—including the famous Demerara Greenheart, which is unrivalled for underwater structures, piling, etc., and Mora, which is becoming increasingly known and valued for railway sleepers—charcoal and hides are also exported.

Within recent years there has been a marked tendency towards the amalgamation of sugar estates and at present 24, run under separate management, are in active operation; the acreage under sugar is 67,087 English acres and the area reaped 62,941 English acres. The rice cultivation in the Colony was returned at 49,159 English acres, but including the second or Spring crop the actual area reaped was 62,033 acres. Other crops grown, such as ground provisions, coffee, rubber, coconuts, cacao, citrus and other fruit, and limes amounted to 40,106 acres.

The forests, with which the interior of the colony is covered, abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, and for railway sleepers, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of household furniture.

During 1938, 196,602 tons of sugar, and 1,708,464 pf. gallons of rum, were produced. The bulk of the production is high-class vacuum pan sugar for refining purposes, while certain quantities of the far-famed "Demerara Crystals" are still exported.

Coconut, coffee and cocoa are grown on the alluvial soils on the banks of the rivers. Rice is now grown to a considerable extent, chiefly by East Indians, on the low lands within the empoldered areas.

Rice exported, 1938, 12,911 tons, valued at 120,516l.

Gold and diamond working is carried on by about 5,500 diggers. The diamonds exported during 1938 amounted to 33,509 carats, valued at 78,589l.

The values of the principal exports besides sugar (183,436 tons valued at 1,577,912l.) and rice are:

| Article                  | Quantity | Value   |

| Coconuts, No.            | 452,042  | 896     |

The chief imports are beef, pork, cheese, butter, cornmeal, flour, machinery, motor vehicles, dried fish, manure, tobacco, oils, earthenware, glass and hardware, cutlery, textiles, spirits, wines and malt liquors.

Fifty per cent. of the trade is with the United Kingdom, 15 per cent. with Canada, and 11 per cent. with the United States; the remainder being divided chiefly between British India, British West Indies, Holland, Germany, Japan, Belgium and Argentina.

Import duties are leviable both on an ad valorem and a specific basis, the total amount of revenue collected in 1938 from goods paying specific duties being 395,884l. as compared with 161,061l. from...
goods subject to ad valorem rates. The prevailing ad valorem duty rates (calculated on c.i.f. values) are 163 per cent. (British Preferential tariff) and 234 per cent. (General tariff). Jewellery, motor vehicles and parts, plate and plated ware pay 20 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively, while agricultural and other industries' machinery is exempt from duty if of British Empire manufacture but is liable to a 7½ per cent. ad valorem duty if of foreign origin.

Most dutiable articles of British Empire manufacture or production receive a preference equivalent to one-half of the General tariff rates, but the preference on certain specified articles, viz., apples, beef (pickled), boots and shoes (not being of rubber), butter, cement, cheese, cocoa, confectionery, cordage, fish (canned, dried or otherwise preserved), lard, milk, pork is a minimum of 66½ per cent. The preference on flour is 48 cents a bag of 198 lbs., on spirits 60 cents a gallon, and on wine, beer and ale 20 per cent. of the general rate. Boots and shoes of rubber receive a preference of over 100 per cent.

The following are the principal revenue-yielding articles of import on which duty is payable on a specified weight or other measure of quantity—Tobacco, flour, spirits, kerosene oil, motor spirit, wines and malt liquors.

Medical Institutions.

There are seven Government public (general) hospitals providing beds for approximately 954 patients. The accommodation varies from 6 beds in smaller out-stations to 622 beds in the Public Hospital, Georgetown (Demerara).

There is also a Mental Hospital in Berbice and a Leprosy Hospital at Mahaca (Demerara) providing accommodation for 758 and 520 patients respectively.

There are in addition to the dispensaries attached to the general hospitals 14 Government dispensaries in outlying parts of the Colony.

Twenty-two hospitals, with dispensaries, with 1,495 beds, are maintained by proprietors of sugar estates.

Attached to the Public Hospital, Georgetown, (Demerara) are X-Ray and Electrical-treatment, Ophthalmic, Dental and Bacteriological Departments, and Venereal Diseases and Tuberculosis sections. Infirmarys are attached to the Prisons (2), Alms House (1) and Industrial School.

The Public Health Department consists of 3 Health Officers and 41 Sanitary Inspectors.

There are three institutions where nurses are trained by qualified medical and nursing staffs.

There is a Surgeon Specialist attached to the Public Hospital, Georgetown, and the European nursing staff consists of 1 Nurse Superintendent and 5 Divisional Sisters.

Education.

A State-aided system of elementary education was established by Law—The Education Ordinance, Cap. 196. Elementary education is compulsory and free.

The elementary schools are denominational. The central administration is vested in a Director and Education Committee, and the local control in managers, who are usually ministers of religion.

The number of schools receiving aid in 1938 was 238, with 53,373 scholars, and the aid granted amounted to 79,847l.

Provision is made for the higher education of boys by a Government college in Georgetown, in which the course of instruction is similar to that of a public school or first grade grammar school in England. Two secondary schools for girls, one for boys, and one for boys and girls, receive grants in-aid from the Government, and there is awarded annually one public scholarship of the value of 900l., open to boys and girls and tenable at a University or College in the British Empire. Twelve Scholarships, entitling the holders to free education at the Government College or at other approved schools, are granted to scholars of the elementary schools. In 1924-25 the whole system of education in the Colony was investigated by a Commission. Important changes were recommended, and are being made as opportunity arises.

A Teachers' Training Centre was established in September, 1928.

During 1931 a Government School with accommodation for 600 pupils was erected in Georgetown in place of two elementary denominational schools which were closed. This school was opened on 1st June, 1932. In 1935 another Government school was opened in the county of Essequibo in place of two denominational schools which were closed, and in the previous year a denominational school was taken over as a Government school. There are now, in all, seven Government schools, two of which are small schools for Aboriginal Indians and one a Kindergarten school in Bush Lot Settlement, Essequibo.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. British sterling is current and legal tender.

On the 16th August, 1915, the Combined Court approved of the issue of Government Currency Notes of the face value of $1 24s. 2d., and $2 28s. 4d. The first notes were issued in January, 1917; and on the 31st December, 1937 there were Notes in circulation to the face value of 129,797l.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., and Royal Bank of Canada have establishments at Georgetown, with branches at New Amsterdam, Berbice. The former, on the 31st December, 1937, had a note circulation in British Guiana 115,210l. and the Royal Bank of Canada 70,520l. The total note circulation in the Colony on the 31st December, 1937, was 315,527l.

The first Government savings banks were established at Georgetown and New Amsterdam in the year 1836. The Combined Court in November, 1910, passed a resolution approving of the amalgamation of the two Banks, and authorising the transfer of the Government Savings Bank to the Post Office on the 1st July, 1911.

The British Guiana Bank, now the Royal Bank of Canada, opened a Savings Bank Department when this amalgamation took place, and a considerable amount of business went into their hands. Barclays Bank has also since opened a Savings Bank department.

There are 46 Post Office Savings Banks. At the end of 1937 these banks had 53,914 depositors, with 577,681l. to their credit.
