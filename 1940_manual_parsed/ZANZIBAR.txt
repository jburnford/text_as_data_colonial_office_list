ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is 63 miles long by 24 broad (maximum measurements), and has an area of 640 square miles. To the north-east at a distance of some twenty-five miles lies the island of Pemba in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 42 miles long by 14 broad (maximum measurements), and having an area of 380 square miles.

Climate.

The normal annual rainfall in Zanzibar Town amounts to 58-59 inches and in Pemba a mean derived from two stations was 73-25 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined: the heavy rains occur in April and May previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The mean maximum temperature in Zanzibar is 84-4° and the mean minimum 76-6°. The corresponding figures for Pemba are 86-6° and 76-1° respectively.

People.

The Arabs were the conquerors of the islands. They founded the clove industry and still possess considerable property in plantations. They understand the natives and the natives understand them and accept their control and that of Europeans more readily than that of other races.

The bulk of the native population numbering 200,000 is known by the generic name of Swahili, a term formerly used to denote the Bantu coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "swahil" in Arabic meaning "coasts." This general appellation includes the descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar who intermarried with negro women. They are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern and southern portions of the islands. A quiet shy people, occupied mainly in the cultivation of native crops and fishing, they rarely move from their homes except to pick cloves. The name Swahili also includes the descendants of the early settlers in Pemba who are known as Wapemba. These people engage chiefly in agriculture but raise a smaller variety of native crops than the Wahadimu. Many of them own clove and coconut plantations. They live in less seclusion than the natives on the larger island.

Another tribe included in the term are the Watumbatu whose chief stronghold is Tumbatu Island. They are a very exclusive people but by no means shy. They are fishermen and sailors and man most of the native sailing craft plying in Zanzibar waters.

There is in addition a considerable influx of various tribes from the mainland, of whom the Wanyamwezi are economically the most important, being now the chief source of supply for the weeding of plantations.

In the 1931 Census the total population of the Protectorate was returned as 235,428 but it is now estimated at approximately 250,000. Of the non-native population of approximately 50,000 some 35,000 are Arabs. The Khoia, Bohora, Hindu, Parsee Indians and the Goans possess most of the trade, either as merchants, shopkeepers, money-lenders, small traders or skilled mechanics. Many Manga Arabs in the rural areas carry on small retail provision businesses.

History and Constitution.

The beginnings of Zanzibar history are lost in antiquity. It appears more than probable that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were known to the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Jews, but though the expedition of Necho (C. 600 B.C.) doubtless passed the Islands it is not till the first century that the Periplus gives a description of one of them under the name of Menuthias. The Hindus appear to have settled at a very early date and traces of Greek colonisation are not lacking. From about the 7th Century B.C. the Islands appear to have had a close connection with the South Arabian States. Bantu settlers probably made their appearance during the first five centuries A.D., and thereafter for the next five hundred years or so came also traders from China and Malaya in addition to those from the Persian Gulf. The Coast was probably converted to Islam early in the 10th Century. The Zenji Empire was founded by Ali bin Hassan, a prince of Shiraz, about 975 A.D., but it soon broke up into separate states and, by the time the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral, was already declining.
It was during the sixteenth century that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa Fort in 1698 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by transferring his capital from Muscat and making the island his permanent residence in the year 1832. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "everybody as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain, and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000l. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000l.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the British Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized the Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

The Government was vested in a High Commissioner, who was also Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate, and a British Resident.

The High Commissionership was abolished in 1925.

A Protectorate Council, with His Highness as President, was established at the same time. It was of an advisory and consultative nature and ceased to exist in 1926 when Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted.

Industries and Trade.

Zanzibar is now the dominant partner in the clove industry, holding as it does the greater part of the shares. The other partners are Madagascar, Penang, and the Dutch East Indies.

Authorities differ as to the date when and country from which the clove tree was first introduced into Zanzibar. Some say that it was brought from Réunion by an Arab at the end of the 18th century. Colonel Rigby, Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, in his report on the Zanzibar dominions written in the year 1860, states "the first clove trees were introduced about 30 years ago from Mauritius; being found to thrive they were extensively planted and they have now become the most valuable production of these Islands."

To Seyyid Said belongs the credit of establishing and promoting the clove industry. Burton records that he threatened confiscation to those who did not plant three clove trees for every coconut and that the country was almost denuded of the latter to make room for cloves. In 1839-40 the output amounted to about 9,000 frasils. (The Frasila, equivalent to 35 lbs., is the local measure of weight for cloves.) In 1849 it had risen to frasilas 120,000. In 1859 frasilas 139,000, valued at 55,666l. were exported, and the average output during the next decade was frasilas 200,000, valued at about 85,000l. Owing to the increase in production the price had, however, fallen from $5.86 to $1.82.

In 1872, a hurricane of great violence swept over the Island of Zanzibar and destroyed two-thirds of the clove and coconut trees. Pemba, though touched by the hurricane, sustained little damage. The years following this disaster were years of short supply, high prices, and intensive cultivation. The Pemba owners, actuated by motives of gain, hastened to cut down coconut trees on a wholesale scale throughout the island and to plant clove trees in their place. The Zanzibar owners, though temporarily ruined, set to work with commendable fortitude to replace the trees which the hurricane had destroyed, and ten years after the hurricane the normal output of cloves had not only been restored but increased.

Another event of great economic importance to the industry was the abolition of slavery. The industry was built up and for many years sustained on slave labour imported from the interior of Africa. In 1873 Seyyid Burgash entered into a treaty to suppress the sea-borne traffic in slaves and to close all public markets in his dominions for the buying or selling of imported slaves. Various treaties and legislative measures followed until the year 1897, when by a decree of Seyyid Hamoud the legal status of slavery was abolished. It may be noted parenthetically that in the year 1890 Great Britain assumed a protectorate over Zanzibar.

The history of labour subsequent to 1897 is a tale of shortage, disinclination on the part of the labour available to engage in any form of settled work, inability or disinclination on the part of the Arabs to pay money wages, and administrative effort to organize the available supply. The introduction of Indian labour was at one time or another canvassed but never materialized. In
1904 and 1906 and at other subsequent times recourse was had to recruitment of labour on the mainland.

In recent years recruitment of labour from outside the Protectorate has been limited and Zanzibar has, to an increasing degree, become dependent for its agricultural labour (particularly clove pickers) upon local natives, augmented by mainlanders who have come over voluntarily in search of work.

Since the abolition of slavery no event of major economic importance has occurred. There have been the usual ups and downs, but production has increased. 187,203 cwts. of cloves valued at approximately £14,964l. were exported in 1938. The export of clove oil was 235,518 lbs., valued at £24,306l.

A Clove Growers' Association, established in 1927, was incorporated by decree in 1934. Its major object is the marketing of cloves.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both Islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 55,000 acres under cultivation and 3½ million trees in both Islands. The export of domestic copra amounted to 11,897 tons valued at approximately £97,450l., and in addition coconuts and coconut oil to the value of £4,612l. were exported. Much is produced by the small grower or trader, neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Ceylon.

As a preliminary to a grading scheme a Decree to prevent the adulteration of produce was applied to copra, an improvement in the general quality being apparent by the end of the year.

There is a general ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. on imported goods with the exception of certain articles which have either a specific duty or a higher ad valorem duty, such as spirits, motor spirits, kerosene, cigarettes, tobacco, matches, tea, milk, cotton and artificial silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, boots and shoes, etc. There is also a schedule of articles exempt from duty. The Tariff includes no provisions for Empire preference.

The principal articles of import are rice and grain, cotton piece goods, motor spirit and petroleum, sugar, tobacco, manufactured (including cigars and cigarettes), flour, ghee, sesame, cattle, dried fish, bags and sacks and straw bags.

The principal articles of export (including re-exports) are cloves, copra, cotton piece goods, rice and grain, clove oil, motor spirit and petroleum, ivory, millet, and simsim.

The following are the percentages of imports from and exports to principal countries of origin and destination during the year 1938:

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (£s. 20s. = £1.) with the following subsidiary coinage:-50 cts. (silver) and 10 cts., 5 cts., 1 ct. (bronze). East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon. The amount in circulation at 31st December, 1938, was notes £363,668l. and coin £102,996l.

Two British Banks maintain branches in the territory:-The National Bank of India, Limited; The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited; both at Zanzibar.

There are also two private Indian banking firms:-Messrs Jetha Lila & Mr. Saleh Gangji.

There are no agricultural or co-operative banks, but the Clove Growers' Association assists in the finance of the clove industry by granting loans on the security of chattel mortgages.

There is a Government Savings Bank with 7,298 depositors at the end of 1938 and total deposits of £78,722l.

Shipping and Communications.

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of trans-shipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast. Recent figures, nevertheless, tend to indicate that the Island will continue, by reason of its geographical position, to retain control of the local traffic.

It possesses an excellent water supply, the best on the East Coast of Africa. A considerable quantity is supplied to shipping annually.

The British India Steam Navigation Company maintain a monthly service between London—Zanzibar—Beira, the Union Castle Mail Steamship Company a monthly service London—Zanzibar—London round Africa in alternate directions, the Bank Line a monthly service Calcutta—Zanzibar—Cape Town, the Clan—Ellerman—Harrison Line between Glasgow—Liverpool—Zanzibar—Beira (cargo only), the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes a fortnightly service Marseille—Zanzibar—Madagascar—Mauritius, the Holland Africa Line a monthly service Rotterdam—Zanzibar—Rotterdam round Africa in...
alternate directions, Royal Packet Steamship Co. a monthly service between Java and Zanzibar, the Lloyd Triestino a monthly service from Italy to Cape Town via Suez and back. The British India Steam Navigation Company also maintain a fortnightly service Bombay—Zanzibar—Durban, also a coastal service Lamu—Zanzibar—Mikindani, the Osaka Shosen Kaisha a monthly service Kobe—Zanzibar—Durban and South America. The American South African Line maintain a monthly service between Zanzibar and New York via South Africa, the Robin Line also a monthly service between Zanzibar and New York via South Africa.

Government steamers maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba and Dar-es-salam. Zanzibar has become a port of call in the itinerary of a number of large tourist steamers.

Cable and Wireless Limited owns and operates the cable station whence telegraphic communication is maintained via Aden, via Seychelles and via Durban with all parts of the world through the Company's system.

The maximum word rates to Great Britain and all parts of the Empire are:—Full rate lsh. 25 cts., CDE 85 cts. (5 words minimum), Deferred 65 cts. (5 words minimum), Letter Telegrams 45 cts. (25 words minimum). Empire Social Telegrams 45 cts. (12 words minimum).

There are 1754 miles of roads throughout the Island of Zanzibar and 738 miles in Pemba suitable for motor traffic. The Government maintains wireless stations and telephone systems in Zanzibar and Pemba.

There are 7 post offices in the two Islands.

**Constitution and Government.**

The Government is administered by a British Resident, who is appointed by commission under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1924.

The law of the Protectorate consists of Orders in Council, the Decrees of the Sultan, and certain Imperial Statutes of general application. His Highness's Decrees and legislation subsidiary thereto, when countersigned by the British Resident under Article 42 of the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are binding upon all persons. The Muhammadan Law, declared in civil matters to be the fundamental law of His Highness's Dominions, controls in some measure personal relationship.

There are Executive and Legislative Councils, established by the Sultan's Decree Cap. 28 (R.L.2Z., 1934).

Justice, in cases in which persons subject to the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are concerned, is administered by H.B.M.'s High Court and the Court's subordinate to it, and in other cases by H.H. the Sultan's Court for Zanzibar and the Courts subordinate to that Court. Subordinate Courts are held by Resident Magistrates, Administrative Officers, and Arab Kathis. In addition, District Courts, under the Presidency of Arab Administrative Officers (Mudirs), exercise a limited criminal jurisdiction. An Appeal lies from the British Court and from the Zanzibar Court in the exercise of their original civil and criminal jurisdiction to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa and thence to the Privy Council.
