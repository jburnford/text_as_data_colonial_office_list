HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton, between 22° 11' and 22° 18' N. lat., and 114° 7' and 114° 16' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area about 32 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Lyceum Pass, which is about ¼ mile wide. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (3 square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1860 with the Government of China, and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutters', Green, Aplohau, Middle, Round, and other islets.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with the Chinese Government for the extension of Hong Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwang-tung, including Mira Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be leased for 99 years; a stipulation was included that within the walled city of Kowloon (which lies outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials then stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong, but that within the remainder of the newly-leased territory Great Britain should have sole jurisdiction. In 1899 the Chinese officials ceased to exercise jurisdiction within Kowloon City, which thereafter, by Her late Majesty's Order in Council, was incorporated in the leased territory and became subject to British rule. The area of the mainland and islands leased is about 359 square miles. A careful survey of the territory was completed in 1904. These New Territories are divided into two main districts—the Northern and the Southern—and are in charge of two District Officers, who perform the duties of land officers and magistrates, and are authorised to hold small debts courts. The District Officer of the Northern district has his headquarters at Tai Po on an arm of Mira Bay; the headquarters of the Southern district are in Victoria.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of 17 square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The city of Victoria extends for five miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees. Some large and handsome buildings stand on the Praya West Reclamation, which was completed in 1903.

Other important reclamation schemes completed in recent years are the Praya East (2,249,000 sq. ft.), Tai Kok Tsui (1,868,500 sq. ft.), Shamshuipo (2,842,000 sq. ft.), and Kowloon Bay (9,589,000 sq. ft.). On the reclaimed area at the northern end of Kowloon Bay an aerodrome has been constructed at Kai Tak.

Climate.

Though situated within the tropics Hong Kong enjoys a cool winter, the mean temperature falling from 82° in July to 59° in February. Temperatures of less than 40° and of greater than 90° occur occasionally.

The mean annual rainfall is 84 inches, of which 67 inches occurs from May to September.

The relative humidity is very high in the spring, frequently reaching 100%. In the winter it occasionally falls as low as 20%.

The prevalent wind is from E.N.E. in the winter with a mean velocity of 11 m.p.h. in March, when the north-east monsoon is at its height. During the summer months the wind is very variable, both in direction and velocity. In some years a south-west monsoon is fairly persistent, in others intermittent and short-lived.

Typhoons occur occasionally from June to October. Very occasionally they occur before or after this period.

The climate of Victoria is similar in its broad features to that of Kowloon and the New Territories, but at the higher levels, from 1,400 to 1,800 feet above sea level, the temperature is on the average about 5 to 8° lower than at the Observatory, Kowloon. The humidity is usually greater than in Kowloon and approaches saturation for several days at a time during March and April when mist is very prevalent. In summer the city of Victoria, and the rising terraces behind it, derive little or no benefit from the south-west monsoon, being sheltered by steep hills from south-east to southwest. In winter it is exposed to the north-east monsoon, which occasionally blows along the harbour through Lyceum Pass with considerable violence. On the other hand the south-west side of the Island is protected from the north-east monsoon in winter and enjoys the benefit of the south-west monsoon in summer.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843. The additions subsequently obtained on the mainland have been noted above.

Hong Kong did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851 and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1935 being: emigrants, 149,515; immigrants, 112,420, excluding to and from China ports.

(This figure does not include the influx of refugees from China who are estimated to number between 300,000 and 500,000.)
Hong Kong situated the main island between the Victoria Harbour ridge, and at an altitude of about 2,000 feet above sea level. The city was ceded by the Chinese government to Great Britain in 1841.

In 1997, China reclaimed Hong Kong from the United Kingdom. The new territory is now part of China, and the British administration ceased to exist.

The most important reclamation schemes completed in recent years are the Praya East (2,249,000 sq. ft.), Tai Kok Tsui (1,868,500 sq. ft.), Shamshuipo (2,843,000 sq. ft.), and Kowloon Bay (9,589,000 sq. ft.).

(This figure does not include the influx of refugees from China who are estimated to number between 300,000 and 500,000.)
Industry, Trade, and Customs.

Hong Kong is a free port except for an Import Tariff on all intoxicating liquors, on spirituous liquors containing more than two per cent. of pure alcohol by weight, on tobacco, and on hydro-carbon oils (including motor spirit) and on motor vehicles not of British Empire origin. There is no Export Tariff.

The position of the island has made it a distributing centre for trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal commodities handled are coal, cotton, and cotton goods, hides, iron and steel, matches, nuts, oils, rice, sugar, silk, sandalwood, tea, tin, wolframite, etc.

Ship repairing and general engineering is a large industry, and there are also factories of very considerable importance engaged in the manufacture of cigarettes, rope, cement, rubber shoes, knitted goods, and the refining of sugar.

Native industries such as the manufacture of vermilion, sauces, bamboo-ware, building of native craft, etc., are of large and increasing dimensions.

The natural products of Hong Kong are few and unimportant. There is little land suitable for tillage, and nothing is grown but a little rice and some vegetables near the outlying villages. There are large granite quarries both on the island and in Kowloon. A dairy farm supplies fresh meat, poultry, eggs, and milk. The fishing in the waters of the Colony is good and is a source of livelihood to a vast number of Chinese.

The New Territories are intensively cultivated, rice being the most important crop. Vegetables, groundnuts, fruit, sugarcane, etc., are also grown; and pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks are commonly bred. Farming is mostly in the hands of Chinese villagers, though the number of large farms leased by urban landlords is on the increase.

Shipping.

The total tonnage entering and clearing during the year 1938 amounted to 30,962,756 tons, a decrease of 6,868,004 tons compared with 1937. There were 12,344 arrivals of 14,739,047 tons, and 12,326 departures of 14,791,337 tons.

Of British Ocean-going tonnage, 5,697,063 tons entered, and 5,700,080 tons cleared.

Of British River Steamers, 3,256,472 tons entered, and 3,254,495 tons cleared.

Of Foreign Ocean-going, 5,701,287 tons entered, and 5,752,064 tons cleared.

Of Foreign River Steamers, 59,870 tons entered and 59,239 tons cleared.

Of Steamships under 60 tons trading to ports outside the colony, 24,365 tons entered and 24,559 tons cleared.

Of Junks in Foreign Trade 329,899 tons entered and 336,753 tons cleared.

Of Junks in Local Trade 413,004 tons entered and 365,743 tons cleared.

Docks.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company has three dry docks and two slips at their Kowloon establishment, one dry dock at Mong Kok Tsui on the western side of the Kowloon Peninsula, and two at Aberdeen on the south side of the island. The Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company has one large dock and three slipways situated at Quarry Bay, just inside the Lyemun Pass.

The Admiralty has built a large dock in the Naval Dockyard in the middle of the City of Victoria. Besides these, there are several building slips and repairing shops owned by Europeans and Chinese in various parts of the Colony.

Wharves.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf & Godown Co., situated on the mainland, has five wharves and can accommodate vessels of 550 ft. in length. No. 1 and No. 5 Wharves are capable of accommodating vessels up to 750 feet.

Alf. Holt & Co. have two wharves at the East Point of the Kowloon Peninsula and have accommodation for large vessels.

At North Point on the Hong Kong side of the Harbour, the Ching Siong Land Investment Co. has built about 1,700 feet of quay walling providing a depth of 30 feet of water alongside at L.W.E.S.T.

In addition, there are many wharves privately owned by shipping firms, situated in the Central district.

Government Harbour Moorings.

There are at present laid down in the Harbour for the use of vessels frequenting the Port forty-eight (48) complete sets of Government Harbour Moorings, classified as follows:

| Class | Moorings for vessels of feet in length O.A. |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| A     | 450 to 600 feet                             |
| B     | 300 feet to 450 feet                        |
| C     | less than 300 feet                          |

Currency and Banking.

Until recently the currency of Hong Kong has, under the Order-in-Council of the 2nd of February, 1895, been based on the silver Mexican dollar and the British silver dollar. Subsidiary silver half dollars, silver pieces of 20 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents, and copper coins were also in circulation. Cupro-nickel 10 cents, and 5 cent pieces were placed in circulation in November, 1936.

As from the 5th of December, 1935, under the Currency Ordinance, 1935, the notes issued by three banks having the power of issue in the Colony, i.e., the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Mercantile Bank of India, the total circulation of whose notes amounted at the end of 1938 to $239,491,955, have been made full legal tender, and their exchange value* is controlled for the time being by the operations of a Government Exchange Fund set up by the same legislation. An issue of Government $1 notes, which are also unlimited legal tender, has also been made. For the present the Mexican, British, and Hong Kong dollars, and the subsidiary coin as previously issued, remain legal tender, but the silver dollars have been called in by the Government and are no longer in active circulation.

The principal Banks are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Ltd., the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Mercantile Bank of India, the P. & O. Banking Corporation, Ltd., the National City Bank of New York, The Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Netherlands-India Commercial Bank, the Netherlands Trading Society, the Banque de l'Indo-Chine, the Crédit-Foncier d'Extrême Orient. The first named bank conducts a Savings Bank. There are also a large number of Chinese banks.

* On 1st January, 1938, the exchange rate with Sterling was $1 = 1/24.
Local weights and measures are the following:
1 tael = 1½ oz.; 1 picul = 133½ lbs. (avoidupois);
7½ catties = 1 imperial gallon.

Revenue.

The principal sources of revenue are rates (varying from 16 to 17 per cent. on the annual value of property) expected, in 1939, to yield $6,212,000, tobacco duty $4,600,000, stamp duties $2,300,000, liquor duties (including duty on locally manufactured liquor) $2,750,000, estate duty $1,250,000 and land sales $750,000.

The total revenue for 1939 is estimated at $15,257,821.

Finance.

There is a Public Debt of $4,838,000 and $11,760,000. The amount at credit of the Sinking Fund of the 4 per cent. Conversion Loan is $4,325.

Means of Communication.

Hong Kong is well situated as an important centre of cable and wireless communication linking various points in the Far East with all parts of the world. Cable & Wireless Ltd. have three cables to Singapore, one direct and one each via Labuan and Cape St. James respectively, which provide good connections with Europe via India, with Australasia and other British colonies and possessions. Their cable to Manila links with the direct American cable to U.S.A., and their cable to Shanghai via Foochow together with the Great Northern (Danish) Company's cable to Shanghai via Amoy gives a good connection with North China, Japan, Russia, and Europe via Asiatic Russia. In addition to these cable facilities, Cable & Wireless Ltd. maintain direct commercial wireless telegraph services with all important cities in South China and other chief centres in the Orient; linking up with the main trunk routes throughout the world via Shanghai, Manila, Saigon, Bangkok and Malabar.

A wireless telephone service linking the Hong Kong Telephone Company's system with Chungking and Manila was recently inaugurated. The Post Office Department operates and controls an efficient wireless telegraph service with ships at sea and aircraft, and maintains the Government Broadcasting service in addition to other domestic wireless services for the Police and Harbour Departments. The Post Office Department also provides for licensing and inspection facilities under the local Telecommunications Ordinance and the reception and distribution of all wireless news messages.

The Government-operated transmitters for the marine service include the medium (600 metre), short wave (36 metre), and Beacon transmitters using the call sign VPS, and Messrs. Cable & Wireless Ltd. transmitters use the call signs ZCE to ZCI with ZEM and ZEO for their commercial telegraph and telephone services.

The Government-operated Aeradio transmitters use the call sign ZCK and operate on 900 metres, 55-45 metres and 34-29 metres; the Broadcasting transmitters use the call signs ZBW (European programmes) on 355 metres and ZEK (Chinese programmes) on 468-8 metres. A 2 kw. short wave transmitter operating on 31-49 metres (9525 kc.) and sharing the European and Chinese programmes, uses the call sign ZBW3.

Land lines connect the various transmitting and receiving stations and the two central control offices.

Hong Kong possesses unrivalled steam communication. The P. & O. S. N. Co., M. M. Cie., Holt's Line, City Line, Lloyd Triestino, and N.Y.K. maintain a regular service with the United Kingdom and Europe. The Holt's line, O.S.K., N.Y.K., and Dollar Line maintain a regular service between Hong Kong and the United States of America. The Canadian Pacific S.S. Limited maintain a regular service with Vancouver, B.C.

The E. & A., Australian Oriental Line, and N.Y.K. and O.S.K. keep up a frequent service to Australian ports. In addition to these main lines of steamers, there are other lines which call at Hong Kong from various ports, such as the Shire, Glen, and Bank lines.

Regular steam communication between Java and Hong Kong has been established by the Java-China-Japan Line. Between the ports on the east coast of China, Formosa, and Hong Kong the steamers of the Douglas S.S. Co. ply regularly twice a week, and those of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha weekly, and there is constant steam communication with Hoihow, Manila, Saigon, Haiphong, Tourane, Bangkok, Borneo, etc. With Shanghai, Tientsin, and the ports of Japan there is frequent communication by steamers of the Indo-China S.N. Co., China Navigation, and other lines, in addition to the English, French and American mail steamers. With Calcutta there are services by the Indo-China S.N. Co., O.S.K., N.Y.K., and the British India Line, about once a fortnight by each line. Between Hong Kong and Macao, there is a daily steam service, the services to Canton and Wuchow on the West River have been interrupted owing to Sino-Japanese conflict.

A weekly Air mail service was inaugurated by Imperial Airways Ltd. in 1936, between Hong Kong and Penang, connecting with the Main Empire Line. Since 1937, this service has branched off to Hong Kong from Bangkok. In addition (a) the China National Aviation Corporation operate four services per week in each direction between Hong Kong and Chungking; (b) the Pan American Airways Corporation operate a weekly service between Hong Kong and Manila, connecting with the Trans Pacific line; (c) the Eurasia Aviation Corporation service between Hong Kong and Peking has been temporarily suspended; and (d) Air France operate a service once a week between Hong Kong and Paris via Hanoi.

A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels. An electric tramway from Shaukiwan to Kennedy Town, along the whole extent of the city, was completed and opened in July, 1904. The island possesses roads available for vehicular traffic both in the town and outside from which unrivalled views can be obtained, especially from the wind-swept roads in the hill districts. There is also a fine motor road round the island.

There are excellent motor roads in Kowloon and the New Territories—the road to Fanling via Castle Peak and back via Tai po being a panorama of views over a route of several miles.

The usual means of transport is by motor, rickshaw, chair, or boat. A railway was completed in 1910 from Kowloon to the Chinese frontier,
where it joins the line from Canton. Telephonic communication is available to all parts of the Colony and to Canton.

British Postal Orders are issued and paid in Hong Kong. Telegraphic Money Orders are exchanged with the United Kingdom only.

Education.

Since 1913 the schools in the Colony, with few exceptions, have been placed by Ordinance under the supervision and control of the Education Department. The total number of pupils is about 104,134, of whom, roughly speaking, one-fifth are in schools in which English is the medium of instruction, and four-fifths are in Vernacular Schools. There are four schools exclusively for children of British parentage, with an average attendance of 525. Queen's and King's Colleges are the principal Government schools for Chinese, with an average attendance of 586 and 767 respectively. There is a Junior Technical School for Chinese opened in 1933, and a Trade School offering courses in Building Construction, Motor Car Engineering and Wireless Telegraphy, which was opened in 1937. Including the above, the average attendance at Government schools is 4,580. Most of the non-Government English schools are assisted by grants, which amounted in 1938 to $247,610. Many of the vernacular schools are assisted by subsidies and grants, amounting in 1938 to $120,945.

An evening institute supplies instruction in commercial and technical subjects. The enrolment in 1938 was 1,243.

The University of Hong Kong, incorporated under the local University Ordinance, 1911, and opened in 1912, is a residential University, the object of which is declared by that Ordinance to be "the promotion of Arts, Science and Learning, the provision of higher education, the conferring of degrees, the development and formation of the character of students of all races, nationalities and creeds, and the maintenance of good understanding with the neighbouring country of China."

Instruction is provided in the four Faculties of Medicine, Engineering, Science, and Arts and the following Degrees are awarded: Medicine, M.B.B.S., M.D., M.S.; Engineering, B.Sc. (Eng.), M.Sc. (Eng.); Pure Science, B.Sc.; Arts, B.A., M.A. The standard aimed at is that of University degrees in Great Britain, and the Medical degrees of the University are recognized by the General Medical Council for registration in Great Britain.

The buildings, including instructional and residential accommodation, together with playing fields, occupy an area of about 364 acres. The instructional buildings have accommodation for about 500 students; the residential buildings have accommodation for 360 students. Residence of women students is not obligatory.

The endowment funds, which include a number of scholarship and prize funds, are partly in sterling and partly in dollars. The sterling funds amount to £298,400, which includes the grant of £265,000 from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund, and the latter includes a grant of HK$750,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation for the establishment of full-time chairs in Surgery, Medicine and Obstetrics, and Gynaecology. The Colonial Government has contributed land to the approximate value of $175,000, together with capital sums amounting to $1,700,000, and provides an annual grant of $350,000.

The course is one of 4 years in Engineering, Science and Arts, and of 6 years in Medicine. In 1938 there were 516 students, of whom 488 were full-time students, and 28 were external students. Students are of various nationalities, but the great majority are Chinese drawn from China and other countries of the Far East, notably Malaya.

The University is open to student of both sexes. In 1938 there were 112 women students.

Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of seven official and three unofficial members, besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of nine official and eight unofficial members, six of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (three being Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils, appointed after receipt of the Additional Instructions passed under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet and dated 10th January, 1922, vacate their seats after five and four years respectively from date of appointment. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances, of which a revised edition to 1923 has been issued. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901.
