**TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.**

**Extent and Boundaries.**

The Tanganyika Territory consists of that portion of the former Colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I, of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the Colony, namely the districts of Ruanda and Urundi in the North-West, and the Kiunga Area, South of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. The Territory extends from the Umba River on the North to the Rovuma River on the South, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands. The Northern Boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of latitude with the eastern shore of the lake (Mohuru Point), and thence along the first parallel of latitude until it strikes the Kagera River about 70 miles west of Lake Victoria. From this point the western boundary follows the Kagera River to approximately latitude 2°25', and thence along the eastern boundary of Urundi to the Mlagamasi River which it follows to Lake Tanganyika. The boundary then follows a line due west until it reaches the centre line of Lake Tanganyika which it follows to Kassanga (formerly Bismarckburg), at the southern end of the lake. Thence it follows the boundary of Rhodesia to the northern end of Lake Nyasa and continues along the centre line of Lake Nyasa to a point due west of the Rovuma River whence the boundary runs east and joins the Rovuma River, whose course it follows to the sea. The total area of the Territory is about 360,000 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of water.

The Island of Mafia was transferred in 1922 from Zanzibar to the Territory.

**General Description.**

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,540 feet, Nyassa, 1,560 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 30,000) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which has a population of 10,000*, and is situated at the junction of the main caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa, and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway; Ujiji, on Tanganyika; and Mwasa, on Nyasa.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilima Njaro, which rises to 19,720 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,960 feet). In the south-west are the Livingstone Mountains, where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz.: the southern portion of Lake Victoria, the eastern shores of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika, and the northern and north-eastern shores of Lake Nyasa. There are smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

**Climate.**

The climate of the Territory varies greatly according to the height above sea-level of the several districts. Roughly, four climatic zones can be distinguished, though even among these there are considerable local variations:—(i) The warm and rather damp coast region with its adjoining hinterland.—Here, conditions are tropical, though not unpleasant except just before and during the rainy seasons, when the heat is trying and the atmosphere humid. The average yearly temperature is 78 degrees. (ii) The hot and moderately dry zone between the coast and the central plateau (300 feet—2,000 feet). This zone is characterised by low humidity of atmosphere, less rain, and a temperature rather lower but with greater daily and yearly variations. (iii) The hot and dry zone of the central plateau between 2,000 feet and 4,000 feet in height.—The climate of this zone differs greatly in parts, but its prevailing characteristics are low humidity, little rainfall (at Tabora an annual average of 1 inch), a fairly high mean temperature, with great daily and yearly variations, sometimes exceeding 36 degrees Fahrenheit daily. The heat is dry, but not so trying to the European as the moist and steamy warmth of the coast, while nights are invariably cold. (iv) The semi-temperate regions around the slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru, of the Usambara Highlands, the Upland Plateau, and the mountainous areas of the south-western area (5,000 feet—10,000 feet).—F

occur at the higher altitudes, and the nights are cold. These districts enjoy a bracing climate, and alone can be considered healthy for Europeans, but prolonged residence in these altitudes is apt to produce nervous strain, even though physical fitness is maintained. There are two well-defined rainy seasons annually. Generally speaking, the long rains begin in February or March, and last for two or three months, while the short rainy season extends from October to November, but the rainfall is low for a tropical country, and droughts are not infrequent.

History and Constitution.

Plentiful evidence exists of Arab traders having visited the Territory for several centuries and of their opening up the great slave route from Bagamoyo on the Indian Ocean to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. The British explorer, Burton, first entered the Territory in 1856, and was soon followed by Speke, Livingstone, and Stanley.

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made twelve treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut.-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilima Njaro and occupied Moshi on March 13th of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's Forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on January 1st, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in 1919 appointing an Administrator. The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on September 25th, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council. In 1921 the district of Ujiji and portions of the districts of Bukoba and Ufipa, which had formerly been administered by the Belgians, were taken over.

In 1920 draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium, and these were approved by the League of Nations in 1922. The mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain lays down conditions directed against slavery, forced labour (except for essential public works and services), abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It is provided that nationals of States members of the League of Nations are to have complete commercial equality. An annual report is to be made to the Council of the League. By an Order in Council dated the 19th of March, 1926, provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, thirteen official members, and not more than ten unofficial members, which came into operation on the 1st July, 1926.

An account of the Constitution of the Standing Conference of East Africa Governors is given in the section relating to Kenya.

Population.

The number of Europeans in Tanganyika Territory is approximately 9,165. There are also over 33,900 Asiatics, chiefly Indians, Arabs and Goans. The natives are estimated at 5,217,345. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Masai and other Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important language is Swahili, which is a hybrid between Arabic and Persian and all sorts of African tongues. It is more or less spoken as a Lingua Franca from Aden in the north to Durban in the south and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but the majority of the coastal tribes and a few in the hinterland profess Mohammedanism.

The territory is divided into 8 Provinces as follows:

| Provinces          | Capital   | Approx. Native Population, 1938 |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Central            | Dodoma    | 547,000                         |

European Education.

Two schools are maintained by Government for the education of European children, one at Dar-es-Salaam and the other at Arusha. A Correspondence Course for children in the more remote districts is conducted from Dar-es-Salaam. Assistance is given to two English Schools, three South African Dutch Schools, five German Schools, two Greek Schools, one European and Goan School and two Kindergarten Schools. The total enrolment is 934.

Indian Education.

There are 67 Indian Schools with a total enrolment of 5,128. Grants-in-aid are paid in respect of staff and buildings. 52 schools are on the grant-earning list. Instruction in the lower standards is conducted in Gujarati or Urdu, and in English in the higher standards. At the Government School in Dar-es-Salaam and at one other school the curriculum is designed to take pupils to the Cambridge Senior Certificate Examination.

African Education.

99 schools are maintained by Government and Native Administrations including six Boys' Primary Schools, one Junior Secondary School and eight Girls' Schools. The total enrolment is 10,664. Swahili is the medium of instruction in primary schools for the first four standards after which there is a bifurcation, some schools continuing instruction in Swahili while, at the larger schools, classes are then
started in English. Stress is placed on the teaching of agriculture and nearly every school has its garden. Industrial sections teach carpentry, masonry, smithing and tailoring. A printing press is attached to the Government School, Dar-es-Salaam. A post-primary Clerical Course extending over two years is undertaken at Tabora Government School in which boys designed for the Local Civil Service are taught office routine, typewriting and accountancy. Assistance is given from Public Funds to 241 Mission Schools with a total enrolment of 25,322.

The total estimated expenditure on Education in 1939 was 109,862L

The Government publishes a monthly journal printed in Swahili to disseminate news and useful information among the vernacular speaking population.

Staff.—The European Staff of the Education Department consists of a Director, Assistant Director, Superintendents of Education, Senior Industrial Instructors, Industrial and Clerical Instructors, Lady Education Officer, Headmistresses, Office Superintendent and Clerk.

The Indian Staff consists of a Headmaster, Senior Assistant Masters, Inspector, Assistant Masters and Clerks.

The African Staff consists of Teachers, Industrial Instructors and Clerks.

Forests and Minerals.

The total area under forests, of types other than savanna, is approximately 4,666 square miles, whereof 87·2 per cent. comprises Government reservation, 2·4 per cent. is Native forest reserve, 6·7 per cent. awaits reservation, and 3·7 per cent. is valuable forest privately owned by non-natives. Close forest areas are mainly grouped: in the North on the shores and islands of Lake Victoria; in the North-east on Kilimanjaro and Meru Mountains; in the East along the Pare and Usambara ranges, also in the Uluguru and Nguu Mountains; in the mountains of the Southern Highlands Province; and at the coast in the districts of Rufiji, Kilwa and Lindi. Such forests contain good merchantable timber in varying quantities, the most important species being Mvule, Camphor and certain African Mahoganies. In addition, the large areas of savanna forest contain valuable hardwood species, principally Mninga and African Blackwood, scattered as single trees or in groups. The creeks and river mouths support extensive mangrove woods valuable as sources of tanning bark and poles which are carried by Arab dhows to the Persian Gulf. Gum copal is plentiful near the coast, and gum arabic of good quality is obtainable in abundance from certain Acacias in the savanna forest areas. Bamboo and baobab also occur in some quantity and may prove suitable for manufacture of paper pulp. The possible output from the Territory’s forests far exceeds present local consumption. Approximate production of timber and fuel wood in 1938 was 666,700 and 6,517,025 cubic feet respectively.

The following have been mined for export or local use:—Gold, talc, tin, wolfram, diamonds, salt, mica, phosphates and red ochre. Other minerals known to exist include:—Coal, graphite, soda, magnesite, gem garnet, corundum and manganese, iron, lead, and nickel ores. Extensive areas remain to be prospected. The total mineral production for 1938 was valued at 712,730L.

Further information with regard to trade and cognate matters in Tanganyika Territory can be obtained from the Chairman, Tanganyika Trade and Information Local Advisory Committee, c/o the Comptroller of Customs, Dar-es-Salaam.

Communications.

The Territory is served by two railways of metre gauge.

Savings Bank business is also performed at 20 District Offices of the Administration.

The principal places in the Territory are connected by telegraph, and the system forms a land line communication link between Kenya and Uganda to the North, and Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and the Union of South Africa to the south. Communication with the Belgian Congo is obtained through a wireless station at Kigoma.

Cable and Wireless Limited owns and operates a cable station at Dar-es-Salaam which is connected by cable with Zanzibar whence telegraphic communication is maintained with all parts of the world through the Company's system. In addition, the Company's Kenya Radio Service provides telegraphic and telephonic communication with Great Britain.

Maximum word rates to Great Britain and all parts of the Empire are:

- Full rate 1 sh. 25 cts., CDE 85 cts. (5 words minimum),
- Deferred 65 cts. (5 words minimum),
- Letter Telegrams 42 cts. (25 words minimum),
- Empire Social Telegrams 42 cts. (12 words minimum).

There are 49 telephone exchanges comprising 284 route miles and 3,063 miles of wire.

The main telephone trunk service is between Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Mombasa, and thence to Nairobi in Kenya Colony. Telephonic communication is available to most places in the Tanga and Northern Provinces. There are also trunk lines between Dar-es-Salaam, Morogoro and Kilosa, and between Tabora and Mwanza.

Commercial radio-telegraph stations are situated at Dar-es-Salaam and Musoma and there are aeronautical stations at Dar-es-Salaam, Mbeya, Dodoma, Moshi and Lindi.

Letter mails are received and despatched by the twice-weekly flying boat mail service from and to all places on the Imperial Airways London-Durban and London-Far East routes. The time taken between Dar-es-Salaam and London is 4 days.

Mails containing second class matter from Great Britain are despatched from London weekly via Marseilles, whence they are conveyed direct by vessels of the Messageries Maritimes, and by the P. & O. Line via Aden, the average time in transit being 22 days. Similar mails are despatched to Great Britain from Dar-es-Salaam and Tanga by all available steamers.

Parcel mails are despatched weekly by steamers of the P. & O. Line from London by the all-sea route to Aden, whence they are conveyed by any steamer proceeding to Mombasa or beyond. The Aden-Mombasa-Dar-es-Salaam service is irregular, and the average time of transit of parcel mails from London to Dar-es-Salaam is 30 days.

Fortnightly services conveying second class mails are maintained with India, and mails are despatched by all available steamers to South Africa. There is a frequent exchange of mails by sea with Kenya Colony and Zanzibar.

Internal first class mails are conveyed by air as opportunity offers and many places have a regular service partly or wholly by air two or three times weekly. First and second class mails are also exchanged between offices on the Railway as frequently as the regular train service permits (minimum twice weekly), while places off the railway normally have a weekly service by Lake steamer, motor or runner.

### Currency and Banking

The German Government and the Deutsch Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft minted and issued silver rupees of the Indian Standard and subsidiary coins. The silver coinage was redeemed at the rate of two shillings of East African currency to the rupee and withdrawn from circulation and ceased to be legal tender as from 1st April, 1923. The period of the redemption of the subsidiary nickel and copper coinage (Hellers) expired on 15th August, 1923. It became necessary to redeem Indian silver coinage at the same rate and redemption was effected by 23rd July, 1921.

The only currency now recognised in the Territory is shillings and subsidiary coins and currency notes of the East African Currency Board.

The banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), and the Banque du Congo Belge.

### Trade and Customs

Since 1923 the Customs Tariff of the Territory has been identical with that in force in Kenya and Uganda and provision was made for the duty-free interchange of all goods grown, produced or manufactured in any one of the three territories. In 1927 the Customs management laws of the three territories were coordinated, and on the 1st August, 1927, effect was given to an Agreement under which all goods on which duty had been collected in one of the territories may be transferred to any of the other territories without further formality except the preparation of simple transfer forms, on which inter-territorial adjustments of revenue are subsequently arranged.

The tariff was revised in 1930, being enacted simultaneously in Tanganyika, Kenya, and Uganda. The basic fiscal rate is 20 per cent. ad valorem, assessed on the current domestic value of the goods in the exporting country together with the cost of packing, delivery on board, freight, insurance and all other charges up to the time of importation into the Territory. On certain goods which permit of such an imposition duty is charged at specific rates corresponding generally to an equivalent ad valorem rate of 20 per cent. Minimum specific rates of duty were imposed on selected imports such as cotton piece goods, artificial silk, cotton blankets, wearing apparel, boots and shoes, umbrellas and cycles in June 1933. On liqueurs and similar spirits the duty is 48 shillings per Imperial gallon, while whisky, brandy, gin and rum are charged with duty at 48 shillings per proof gallon ascertained by Sikes' hydrometer. Manufactured tobacco is liable to 62½ per cent. ad valorem, with a minimum of 8 shillings per pound on cigars, and 2.65 per pound on cigarettes and tobacco. In the case of certain specific commodities such as sugar, timber, wheat flour, bacon and ham, butter, cheese and ghee, which can be produced locally in sufficient quantity to meet the...
demands of the three territories, provision is made, in the form of additional "suspended" duties, for a modified degree of protection. A reduced rate of 10 per cent. ad valorem is payable on building materials, metals, tools, printing materials, paints, children's toys, and infants' foods, while the free list includes machinery, packing materials, ships and boats, aircraft, motor and steam lorries and tractors, materials and equipment for the construction and maintenance of telegraph and telephone lines and of railways, tramways and roads; medicines, disinfectants and insecticides; coal, coke and oil fuel; fertilisers; blasting compounds; filters and refrigerators; surgical and scientific instruments, and all used personal and household effects imported as passengers' baggage. No provision is made for Imperial Preference.

The values in pounds sterling of the import and export trade of the Territory, the total Customs receipts, and the tonnage of vessels entered at Tanganyika ocean ports, are given below. The import figures are exclusive of Government imports, transit traffic, and bullion and specie, while transit exports are similarly excluded from the export figures.
