PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the States of Syria and the Lebanon, which are under French Mandate, on the west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian province of Sinai (the boundary running from a point west of Rafah on the Mediterranean to a point two miles to the west of where the thalweg of the Wadi ‘Araba joins the Gulf of ‘Aqaba) and on the east by Trans-Jordan, which is included in the area of the Palestine Mandate.

The boundary on the north was determined by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920, (Comd. 1195) and in pursuance of that Convention was delimited between the Mediterranean and El Hamme in 1922. The Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government giving effect to the delimitation is published as Cmd. 1910 (Treaty Series No. 13 (1923)).

The frontier runs from the Mediterranean at Ras en Naqura eastwards to Yarun, thence N.E. to the village of Qadas, thence N.E. to Metulla and across the Jordan Valley to Tell el Qadi (in Palestine) and Banias (in Syria), thence S.S.W. to Jiar Banat Ya’qub, thence southwards along the Jordan to the Lake of Tiberias, thence along the eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias to a point almost due east of the town of Tiberias, thence S.S.E. to El Hamme Station on the Hejaz railway.

The frontier with Trans-Jordan is defined as a line drawn from a point two miles west of ‘Aqaba on the Gulf of ‘Aqaba up the centre of the Wadi ‘Araba, the Dead Sea and the River Jordan to the junction of the latter with the River Yarmuq, thence up the centre of the River Yarmuq to the Syrian frontier.

The Natural Divisions of Palestine.

Palestine comprises four zones of country:
(a) The hill country of Galilee and Judaea,
(b) The five plains, including that lying in the rift of the Jordan Valley, which, from the north of Lake Tiberias to the Dead Sea, is actually below the level of the Mediterranean,
(c) the Beersheba area, different in character and population from the rest of the country,
(d) the desert area.

The five plains are:—The Acre Plain, the Plain of Esdraelon, the Huleh Plain, the Coastal Plain and the Plain of the Jordan.

Geology.

The hill country is composed principally of limestone which provides excellent building stone of various types and colours. Calcareous sandstone abounds along the coast and was used by the Crusaders for their maritime forts and castles (Atlit and Acre); the new Haifa breakwater has been constructed of a similar stone from Atlit. Of metallic minerals, copper ores and deposits of manganese occur in the southern part of Palestine near the Gulf of ‘Akaba, but are not worked at present. Petroleum and bitumen exudations are found around the southern part of the Dead Sea. This region and the area westward as far as the Mediterranean Sea has been partially explored by Oil Companies. Exploration was suspended for a period during which oil mining legislation was undergoing revision. The new Ordinance came into force on 1st September, 1938, and active exploration for oil has now been resumed by oil companies to whom oil prospecting licences have been granted. Of non-metallic ores, rock phosphate and bituminous limestone of doubtful commercial value occur in large deposits on the slopes of the Judaean Wilderness. Rock salt occurs in unlimited quantity in the salt dome of Jebel Usdum and has been used for the supply of the Jerusalem market. The production was 444 metric tons in 1938 and 377 metric tons for the first six months of 1939. A sulphur deposit of commercial importance is being worked south of Gaza, the production for 1938 was 1,215 metric tons as compared with 502 metric tons in 1937. A plant for treatment and concentration of the sulphur in the ore is in operation. A good quality of gypsum is found at Menahemiya near Tiberias, production being 3,984 metric tons in 1938, and impure varieties are found on the slopes of the Judaean Wilderness. Extensive deposits of anhydrite (anhydrous gypsum) occur overlying the rock salt at Jebel Usdum.

The production of potassium chloride and bromine by Palestine Potash Ltd. shows a substantial increase and the market has now become world wide. Large evaporating basins have now been constructed at the south end of the Dead Sea. Pumps have been erected and production on a large scale has commenced. In 1938 47,496 tons of potash, were exported valued at £P. 284,970 and 481 tons of bromine valued at £38,000l. There are hot springs of medicinal value at Tiberias and El Hamme where bathing establishments on modern lines have been erected for the treatment of patients and, in addition, at El Hamme, large baths for pleasure bathing in the waters of varying tepid temperatures have been provided.

Climate.

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude and with the distance from the sea: the coastal plain has a typical Mediterranean climate—warm
and rainless in summer and mild and rainy in winter (relative humidity rather high in the immediate vicinity of the sea only); in the elevated hill region the climate is drier and temperate whilst the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight. The summer months are almost rainless. January and February are, in general, the wettest months and the main rainfall occurs between November and April. The rainfall varies largely, from a minimum of 1 inch in the South to a maximum of 45 inches in the North.

Water for domestic use is obtained in the larger towns from piped supplies; in the smaller towns and rural districts, from rock cisterns in which rain water is collected or from small springs or wells.

Malaria, which was formerly very prevalent, has now been eradicated from the large towns and in rural areas a very marked reduction in incidence has been effected as a result of various large drainage schemes, anti-larval control, as well as by mass treatment of the population in those areas where the incidence of the disease was very high. One or two highly endemic areas remain to be dealt with on a permanent basis.

Epidemic diseases are not unduly prevalent.

**Jerusalem Water Supply.**

Jerusalem now has a pipe-borne, filtered, softened and sterilized water supply from Ras-El-Ain Springs (situated some 47 kilometres north-west from and 2,000 feet below Jerusalem). The pipe line is 60 kilometres long. The plant for the supply was installed by the Palestine Government.

All the earlier water supply plants of Jerusalem Municipality, established by the Military, were closed down in 1936.

The second service reservoir of 2,200,000 gallons and extension of 10" to 18" reticulation mains were completed in 1936. Further extensions of 16" and 4" mains amounting to a length of 8,000 meter run have since been made.

**Government.**

Under Turkish rule, part of Palestine was in the Vilayet (Province) of Beirut and part in the Sanjak (District) of Jerusalem. After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British forces, the country remained under British Military Administration until July, 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a Civil Administration set up.

By the Treaty of Peace, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey renounced all rights over Palestine. The Principal Allied Powers had selected His Britannic Majesty as Mandatory at the Conference at San Remo, on 25th April, 1920. The terms of the Mandate were approved by the Council of the League of Nations on the 24th July, 1922, and the Mandate came into force on September 29th, 1923. The Mandatory is responsible, inter alia, for carrying into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd, 1917, viz.:—"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

On the 1st September, 1922, a Constitution was promulgated.

Under this Constitution Palestine is governed by a High Commissioner, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, assisted by an Executive Council consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer and Commissioner on Special Duty, and by an Advisory Council consisting of official members.

An attempt was made in 1923 to create the Legislative Council provided for in the Constitution, but owing to the refusal of the Arabs to take part in the elections, it was replaced by the Advisory Council in order to secure the enactment of legislation until such time as a Legislative Council is created.

English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

In 1921, the Supreme Moslem Sharia Council was constituted for the control and management of the Moslem Awqaf and Affairs in Palestine. Its constitution is a President known also as Rais-Al-Ulema, and four members.

The control of Moslem Awqaf includes the supervision and maintenance of all Moslem shrines, religious buildings and Moslem endowed institutions. Since its formation the Council has, inter alia, established a large Moslem Orphanage at Jerusalem.

Extensive repairs have been and are being carried out on many Mosques, notably those in the Haram el Sherif at Jerusalem.

The Supreme Moslem Sharia Court is also entrusted with the administration of the Sharia (Moslem religious) courts.

Regulations were made under the Religious Communities Ordinance, 1926, by the High Commissioner in 1927 for the organisation of the Jewish Community in Palestine. The Jewish community, like the Moslem and the various Christian communities enjoys autonomy in the administration of its internal affairs, religious, cultural and communal; it has also power to levy rates on its members. The organs of the community are a Chief Rabbinate and local Rabbinical offices, an Elected Assembly, a General Council which is elected by the Assembly and represents the community in its dealings with the Government, and local communities.

Complete freedom in their communal affairs is allowed to those Jewish congregations who have exercised the option to remain outside the recognized community.

The Jewish Agency is recognized as the representative body of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish National Home; it is represented in Palestine by an Executive whose headquarters are at Jerusalem.

The Palestine Government has maintained in force the status and privileges accorded to the different Christian Communities under the Ottoman regime.

A Royal Commission visited Palestine in 1936-37, and submitted certain recommendations to His Majesty's Government in their report published in July, 1937 (Cmd. 5479). In the following year a technical commission was appointed to examine certain aspects of the Royal Commission's recommendations and submitted a report (Cmd. 5854).

On the 18th May, 1939, a White Paper embodying a statement of policy by His Majesty's Government was issued (Cmd. 6019).

The affairs of the towns are administered by Municipal Councils presided over by Mayors. In large villages Local Councils have been set up.

District Town Planning Commissions have now replaced the former Central Town Planning Commission and deal with town planning schemes in their districts put forward by Local Town Planning Commissions both for municipal and rural areas. A Town Planning Adviser who is "ex officio" member of all the District Town Planning Commissions is attached to the office of the Attorney-General. The preparation of regional schemes under his direction are now being considered.
Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into six districts—the Jerusalem, Lydda, Haifa, Galilee and Acre, Samaria and Gaza Districts—each administered by a District Commissioner.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is 10,400 square miles in extent.

The population of this territory taken by Census on November 18th, 1931, was 1,035,821, of which number 387,291 were living in 23 towns and large villages and 66,553 were nomad bedouin. An estimate of the total population at 31.3.39 based on natural increase and excess of immigration is 1,458,090, of whom 909,586 were Moslems, 422,142 Jews, 114,442 Christians and 11,940 others. The Moslems include the nomad bedouin population, about whom no separate figures are available except those given in the Census of 1931 (66,553 estimated). The chief town, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1517, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917. Its population in 1939 was 129,800. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large numbers of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The site of Solomon's Temple is occupied by the Dome of the Rock, which contains a relic of Muhammad and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham. The Western Wall, better known as the Wailing Wall, is part of the outer wall of the Temple, and is sacred to Jews throughout the world. Bethlehem, the scene of Christ's Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity, at the east end of the present village, is said to be the oldest Christian church in existence.

The population figures of the other principal towns in the first quarter of 1939 were:

- Jaffa, 77,400; Tel-Aviv, 130,300; Haifa, 104,800;
- Gaza, 19,900; Nazareth, 10,100; Nablus, 19,900;
- Safad, 19,900; Tiberias, 10,100;
- Hebron, 10,000; Ramle, 12,200; Bethlehem, 7,300; Lydda, 14,300; Acre, 8,900.

Jewish Colonization.

The total Jewish population of Palestine is estimated in March, 1939, at 422,142 persons, and thus constitutes 30.3% of the settled population of the country. Jewish agricultural settlements number 248 and have a population of close on 125,000 persons. 140 of these settlements are situated on land of the Jewish National Fund which was established by the Zionist Organisation for the purpose of acquiring land as inalienable property of the Jewish people. The land owned by the Jewish National Fund amounted in 1939 to 455,000 metric dunams. These settlements were equipped and financed by the Jewish Agency with the funds provided by the Palestine Foundation Fund (Keren Hayesod) which is the financial instrument of the Agency.

During the last eighteen years (April, 1921, to the end of March, 1939) the Keren Hayesod spent £P.2,415,000 on agricultural colonisation; £P.1,127,000 on education; £P.231,000 on labour and urban colonisation; £P.1,140,000 on immigration, health and social work, and £P.1,075,000 on other purposes—in all £P.6,989,000. The investment of the Jewish National Fund in land and improvements, afforestation, water supply, etc., amounted to four million pounds approximately (to the end of June, 1939). The total receipts of the Zionist institutions during the year 1937–38 amounted to £P.1,453,000.

Extensive colonisation work has also been done by the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association (PICA) which took over the colonies established by Baron Edmond de Rothschild and founded new settlements. There are at present 32 such colonies under the PICA administration.

A number of settlements have been established on land acquired by private companies and individuals. The total area in Jewish possession amounted at the end of March, 1939, to 1,340,000 metric dunams. The main areas are located as follows:—Maritime Plain, 375,000; Plain of Esdraelon, 165,000; Jordan Valley, 125,000; hill country, 423,000 and 52,000 in the Negev. In addition 162,000 dunams of land and water have been granted by way of concession, half of which was granted to Jewish colonising institutions, and the other half to industrial concerns in which there is Jewish and non-Jewish capital. The total area held by Jews thus amounts to 1,502,000 dunams, i.e., to 5.7% of the total area of Palestine. The area under oliticulture in Jewish villages amounts to about 160,000 dunams, the export thereof during the season 1938–39 having amounted to over ten million cases.

The Jewish urban population totals approximately 350,000, its main centres being:—Jerusalem and suburbs, 80,000; Tel Aviv, a purely Jewish city, 180,000, including the neighbouring Jewish quarters of Jaffa; Haifa and Haifa Bay, 62,000.

The Jewish community of Palestine is organised in accordance with the provisions of the Communities Ordinance and is represented by the General Council (Vaad Leumi).

At the end of 1939, 95,000 Jewish workers were organised in the General Federation of Jewish Labour. The Federation has organized a comprehensive system of co-operative societies with branches in agriculture, transport, construction, building and credit. It also maintains a workers' sick fund, with 71,000 members in January, 1939, annual budget being £P.251,000.

The Jewish Agency, consisting of Zionists and non-Zionists, functions under the terms of Article 4 of the Palestine Mandate. It is represented in Palestine by an Executive consisting of eight members.

Education.

In July, 1938, the approximate number of children in Palestine between the ages of 5 and 15 was 341,000, of whom 248,000 were Moslems, 68,000 Jews and 25,000 Christians.

The number of children of all ages who attended school in 1937–38 was 158,874, including 63,550 Moslems, 72,403 Jews, and 22,921 Christians.

The Arab Public System of Education, maintained by Government, embraced in that school year 402 schools with 49,400 pupils, and 1,326 teachers, the great majority of whom were Moslems. The schools included 2 Teachers' Training Colleges with 99 men and 60 women students, and 11 schools with 23 secondary classes containing 581 secondary pupils. The Kadoorie Agricultural School at Tulkarm had 50 boarders. Technical education is provided in most of the larger schools and a Trade School was opened in 1938 with 51 boys. The Law School in Jerusalem had 219 students.

The Jewish and Christian Communities provide, the former almost entirely and the latter to a very large extent, for the education of their own children. The Hebrew Public System, controlled by the General Council (Vaad Leumi) of the Jewish Community of Palestine, embraced, at the beginning of 1939, 396 schools with 52,816 pupils. These included 4 Teachers' Training Colleges with 734 students, and 13 secondary schools with 4,971 pupils. There were also 227 private Jewish schools with 21,456 pupils,
including 2 Teachers' Training Colleges with 118 women students and 15 secondary schools with 1,162 pupils.

There are 7 Jewish Agricultural schools with 893 pupils, 14 junior technical schools with 1,428 students, and a Technical Institute at Haifa with 550 students. The Hebrew University at Jerusalem has 800 students. The Hebrew Kadoorie Agricultural School which was opened at Mount Tabor in the summer, 1934, had 40 boarders.

The Christian schools, maintained by various foreign and religious bodies, numbered 193, with 24,046 pupils, 39 of these schools had 122 secondary classes with 1,965 pupils; the 3 agricultural schools had 93 pupils.

There were 97 private Moslem schools maintained by private persons and associations, with 8,364 boys and 2,149 girls. There were also 87 kuttabs or Koranic schools. These provided for 3,639 children, of whom 183 were girls.

Some non-Government schools receive a capitation grant-in-aid from the Department of Education, conditional on the acceptance of a certain measure of Government supervision and inspection. Grants totalling £46,352 were made to the Jewish Community of Palestine for its schools for the financial year 1936-7; these were raised to £53,365 in the financial year 1937-8.

The Palestine Board of Higher Studies was established in 1924. The Government and many educational institutions are represented on it. It conducts the Palestine Matriculation Examination and the Palestine Diploma Examination, both of which are public examinations recognised by Government. The Palestine Matriculation Examination is recognised by many British Universities.

Justice.

The Courts in Palestine are either Civil or Religious Courts. The former have jurisdiction over all matters save those of personal status and Waqfs or charitable endowments, subject to the provisions mentioned below.

There is a Magistrate's Court in each sub-district, and in the larger towns such as Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tel-Aviv, and Nablus, two or more such Courts.

There are five District Courts, each composed of a British President or Relieving President and two Palestinian Judges sitting at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tel-Aviv and Nablus respectively. They go on circuit within the area of their jurisdiction. A District Court has jurisdiction in first instance over all crimes except those punishable with death, and civil cases outside the jurisdiction of a Magistrate in and for that district; it also hears appeals subject to certain restrictions from the decisions of Magistrates both in civil and in criminal cases. A Registrar is attached to each of the District Courts and exercises certain judicial functions. Crimes punishable with death are tried by the Court of Criminal Assize, which consists of the Chief Justice or British Judge of the Supreme Court sitting with the President or Relieving President and a Palestinian Judge of the District Court. The accused may elect to be tried by a British Judge of the Supreme Court sitting alone, and upon application being made, he shall be so tried.

The Supreme Court of Palestine is composed of the Chief Justice and three other British Judges and four Palestinian Judges. The Court sits in two capacities: (1) as a Court of Appeal, and as such it has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters decided by the District Courts in first instance, the Land Courts and by leave, from judgments of the District Courts and Land Courts, in their appellate capacities and the Court of Criminal Assize; (2) as a High Court of Justice, in which capacity it hears petitions for habeas corpus, mandamus, etc., and applications which are not within the jurisdiction of any other Court.

The Court of Appeal is composed of two Judges but the Chief Justice may by warrant under his hand constitute a Court of either three or five Judges, while the High Court may not sit with less than two Judges. In each capacity a British Judge presides.

Benches of honorary Magistrates have been established in certain towns to try contraventions for which the maximum penalty does not exceed £P.5 fine or 15 days' imprisonment or both penalties.

Special arrangements exist in the Beersheba sub-district, where minor cases are disposed of according to tribal custom by the Court of Sheikhs. An appeal lies from this Court to the Tribal Court of Appeal which is constituted of the District Officer of Beersheba as President and two Sheikhs chosen by the District Officer who have not sat in the Tribal Court as members.

All matters of personal status affecting Moslems are within the jurisdiction of the Sharia Courts. A Sharia Court consists of a Qadi, and appeals from his decision lie to the Moslem Court of Appeal, which is composed of a President and two members.

Jewish Religious Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters of personal status of Palestinian Jews and jurisdiction by consent with regard to other nationals except in matters of dissolution of marriage. An appeal from the decision of the Jewish Religious Courts lies to the Rabbinical Council.

The different Christian Communities (such as the Orthodox and the Latin), have similar jurisdiction to that of the Jewish Courts. They also have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals lawfully brought under the law of any country other than Palestine, whether the parties to the appeal are Palestinian citizens or foreigners.

Questions as to whether a case is one of personal status within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Religious Court shall be referred to a Special Tribunal composed of two British Judges of the Supreme Court and the President of the Highest Court of the Religious Community concerned in Palestine.

The Ottoman Code was superseded by the new Criminal Code, based on English law, which came into force on January 1, 1937.

Industry and Trade.

The principal industries of export importance are those of the cultivation of citrus fruits in the Southern District and the district round Haifa; soap-boiling in Nablus, Jaffa and Haifa; wine and brandy distillation, especially in the Jewish settlements, Zikhron-Ya'akov, Rishon-le-Zion and Petah-Tikvah; olive oil in Nablus, Acre, Haifa and the district round Jaffa. Hosiery, fancy leather goods, and a variety of other articles are exported to Syria and other neighbouring countries. Durrah, lentils, sesame, barley and olive oils are also exported, but this largely depends on favourable climatic conditions.

Total exports of oranges and grapefruit were respectively 9,765,159 cases, valued at £P.2,238,007; and 1,798,485 cases, valued at £P.473,682. Exports to the United Kingdom of oranges was 6,166,015 cases, valued at £P.2,034,384, and 976,858 cases of grapefruit, valued at £P.256,742.

The export of melons, mainly to Egypt and Syria, was valued in 1938 at £P.17,123.

The principal imports are rice, valued at £P.230,454, wheat flour £P.242,742, sugar £P.207,049, wheat £P.296,386, petroleum products £P.619,404, wearing apparel £P.335,617, woollen tissues £P.141,790, cotton piece goods £P.322,672, building materials, i.e., iron bars, etc., wood, cement, sanitary ware, electrical fittings, tubes, etc., glass, tiles and bricks,

There is a considerable number of small factories and workshops, including flour mills; factories for soap, brick and tile, knitted goods, textile, artificial teeth, iron and wood furniture, matches; oil mills, cigarettes, fruit juice, edible oils. Of the larger industries, a cement factory produced in 1938, 98,445 tons of cement, imported 42,037 tons and exported 6,701 tons. 14 tobacco and cigarette factories produced in 1938 some 13,872 kilos of cut tobacco, 619,259 kilos of cigarettes, 51,631 kilos of tobacco, 7,649 kilos of snuff, and 1,742 kilos of cigars. 13 wine presses and 17 distilleries produced in 1938 some 3,053,800 litres of wine, 173,845 litres of cognac, 59,696 litres of arak, and 858,997 litres of other spirits. Some 760,386 litres of wine were exported during 1938. Oil factories exported 3,465,774 kilos of edible oils.

A brewery commenced production towards the end of 1935. 1,830,245 litres of beer were produced in 1937, and 1,723,941 litres in 1938.

Production of certain commodities subject to excise duty in 1938 were as follows:—Salt 7,888 tons, matches 206,047 gross boxes and 504,743 kilos of methylated spirits.

The main generating stations of the Palestine Electric Corporation, Ltd., are:—

The Jordan Hydro-Electric Power House—installed capacity, 18,000 KW.
The Haifa Power House—steam turbine plant—installed capacity, 30,000 KW.
The Reading Power House, north of Tel Aviv—steam turbine plant—installed capacity, 24,000 KW.

All power houses are interconnected by a 66,000 volt grid system.

The Jerusalem Electric and Public Service Corporation Ltd. serves the area within a radius of 20 kilometres centred on Jerusalem and including Ramallah, Bethlehem and Beit Jallah.

**Agriculture.**

Modern methods are making headway and hold out hopes of development and progress. The country is generally fertile, and cereals, wine, oranges, grapefruit and lemons, olives and various other fruits and vegetables are produced, while sheep and goats thrive in the lowlands and in the mountains.

For the most part the crops are raised without irrigation, except where springs exist and in the eastern portion of the Plain of Esdraelon, and along the citrus belt on the coast.

There are generally two crops harvested each year—the cereal and leguminous crop in May to June and a summer crop in August and September.

The yields of the main crops in 1936 to 1938 were

| Metric Tons | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| Wheat       | 140,353 | 76,059 | 127,420 | 44,435 |
| Barley      | 68,905 | 55,169 | 75,417 | 66,736 |
| Durra       | 46,135 | 22,122 | 61,023 | 63,253 |
| Lentils     | 2,698 | 2,379 | 3,830 | 3,277 |
| Olives      | 45,092 | 15,755 | 47,247 | 38,572 |
| Water Melons | — | — | 102,859 | 114,805 |
| Grapes      | — | — | 45,873 | 46,784 |
| Figs        | — | — | 18,107 | 22,753 |
| Tomatoes    | — | — | 34,907 | 29,016 |

8,461 tons of bananas were grown mainly in the Jordan Valley in 1938, as compared with 2,394 tons in 1937.

An enumeration of livestock was made in July, 1937, according to which there were in Palestine:—

| Livestock | Quantity |
|-----------|----------|
| Horses    | 20,053   |
| Mules     | 8,989    |
| Donkeys   | 92,206   |
| Camels    | 28,086   |
| Cattle    | 175,209  |
| Sheep     | 209,422  |
| Goats     | 361,424  |
| Poultry   | 2,860,092|

No animal enumeration was carried out in 1938 and 1939.

1,488 tons of fish were caught on the coast and lakes of Palestine, valued at £P.53,374.

**Forestry.**

During 1938-9, 665,000 plants were issued from 10 nurseries maintained by the Department of Forests. Since 1920 planting operations have proceeded on a small scale, and a total of 5,600 acres has been taken in hand. Some 185,000 acres of open land, mainly on rocky hills, but including some areas of sand dunes, have been reserved with a view to eventual afforestation.

**Customs.**

The Customs Tariff, which is non-differential, is fixed partly on a specific and partly on an ad valorem basis: 65% to 70% of imports pay specific charges, principally petrol, kerosene, sugar, rice, wheat, flour, leaf tobacco, cigarettes, wood and timber for building and furniture, rubber tyres and tubes, boots and shoes, motor cars, silk tissues, cotton piece goods.

Sentinel–Camell Steam Rail Cars are in use on the Lydda–Khan Yunis, Haifa–Acre and Haifa–Samakh Sections.

East of Haifa the Palestine Railways Administration extends to Ma'an in Trans-Jordan, but with a break between Samakh and Nasib which is operated by the Chemins de Fer du Hedjaz authorities.

There are (1938) 1,110 miles of roads in Palestine suitable for motor traffic in all weather and in addition over a thousand miles of seasonal track passable for wheel traffic of all kinds.

Postal despatches are exchanged daily (in some cases three times daily) between all principal towns. There is also a daily exchange of despatches with Trans-Jordan and three times weekly with Syria and Egypt. Direct mails for Great Britain are despatched four times weekly by ordinary mail and five times weekly by air mail. An air mail is despatched daily to Egypt and Iraq.

There is a twice-weekly overland desert mail service with Iraq and Persia on Tuesday and Friday via Haifa and Mafrak.

Imperial Airways use the Tiberias seaplane station in connection with the air mail services to and from Great Britain, Iraq, India, Australia, and beyond.

All the principal towns are connected by telegraph and telephone.

Cable and Wireless Limited owns and operates a cable station at Haifa which is connected with Larnaca, Cyprus, and thence with Egypt and all parts of the world through the Company's system. The Company has branches also at Tel Aviv and Jaffa.

The maximum word rates to Great Britain and all parts of the Empire are:

Total length of main telegraph and telephone trunk lines, 19,778 kilometres; local lines, 87,237 kilometres. Number of telephone subscribers 9,241 (exchange lines): telephone instruments in use 16,266.

**Banking, Co-operative and Currency.**

The most important bank in Palestine is Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Nablus, Nazareth, and agencies at Acre, Hadar Hacarmel, Allenby Road North (Tel-Aviv), Ramat Gan, Gaza and Hebron. The Anglo-Palestine Bank Ltd. has its head office in Palestine at Tel-Aviv with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad, Petah-Tiqvah, Hedera, Rehovoth and agencies at Hadar Hacarmel, Allenby Road (Tel-Aviv), North Branch (Tel-Aviv Herzl Street Branch). Affiliated with the Anglo-Palestine Bank Ltd. is the General Mortgage Bank of Palestine Ltd., with head office at Tel-Aviv, which grants mortgage loans on houses.

In addition there are branches in Jerusalem of the Ottoman Bank (also in Haifa, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Nablus and Amman in Trans-Jordan), the Banco di Roma (also in Jaffa, Haifa, Tel-Aviv, and an agency in Jerusalem), the Holland Bank Union at Haifa, and the Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. (Bank P.K.O.) in Tel-Aviv and Haifa. There are also the Workers' Bank Ltd., the Zerbabel Bank Co-operative Society...
Ltd. at Tel-Aviv and the Central Bank of Co-operative Institutions in Jerusalem, which grant credit to co-operative societies.

Following the appointment of the Examiner of Banks, the Banking Ordinance was amended in 1936. Accordingly all banks (foreign and local) are required to submit monthly statements of their assets and liabilities as at the end of each month. Summary statements showing the aggregated figures of commercial banks are published monthly by the Office of Statistics, Jerusalem. On the 31st July, 1939, the aggregate amount of time and demand deposits held by the 6 foreign banks and the 36 local banks amounted to £P.18,299,548, while the total amount of credit granted by these institutions in the form of advances and/or bills discounted amounted to £P.11,610,909.

The co-operative movement is extensively established among the Jewish population, both urban and rural. There is a Registrar of Co-operative Societies whose duties include the encouragement of the growth of a similar movement among the Arab farmers. At the end of August, 1939, the aggregate amount of the deposits held by 104 Jewish Credit Co-operative Societies amounted to £P.1,572,972, while the amount of credit granted to their members in the form of advances and/or bills discounted amounted to £P.2,196,022.

A Currency Board was appointed in London in 1926 in order to introduce and control a Palestine currency based on the pound sterling; and the new currency was issued on the 1st November, 1927, under the authority of an Order of His Majesty in Council dated the 7th of February, 1927.

The standard of currency is the Palestine pound (£P.), divided into 1,000 mils. The Palestine Currency Order provides for a gold coin of one Palestine pound containing 123.27447 grains of standard gold (the equivalent of the English sovereign). It is not intended at present to introduce gold coins. The Currency Board has issued silver coins of 100 and 50 mils, nickel bronze coins of 20, 10 and 5 mils, bronze coins of 2 and 1 mils, and currency notes of £P.100, £P.50, £P.10, £P.5, £P.1 and 500 mils. The currency notes are legal tender for the amounts expressed therein. Silver coins are legal tender for the payment of £P.2, nickel bronze coins of 20 and 10 mils are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 200 mils, and coins of lower denomination are legal tender for an amount not exceeding 100 mils. The amount of Palestine currency in circulation at the 31st August, 1939, was:—Coins, £P.634,212; notes, £P.9,285,923. Amount of currency in circulation increased at the end of August due to the international situation and the abnormal withdrawals of deposits from banks.

The metric system is followed by the Government and local authorities, but the use of local weights and measures is still permitted for the general public.

### Antiquities

The administration of the Antiquities Service in Palestine is controlled by the Department of Antiquities, working under the Antiquities Ordinance (1929) and Regulations (1930-32). During 1938, thirteen licences to excavate or make soundings were issued. The results of the Department's research work, together with summaries of the results of licensed excavations conducted by non-Government bodies, are published in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. (Published by Sir Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, London, E.C.4.)

The Department of Antiquities is housed in a building known as the Palestine Archaeological Museum, the construction and equipment of which were made possible by funds contributed by Mr. John D. Rockefeller ($2,000,000).

For further information on Palestine see the "Handbook of Palestine," issued under the authority of the Government of Palestine; the annual Blue Books, the annual Statistical Abstract and the General Monthly Bulletin of Current Statistics, published by the Office of Statistics of the Palestine Government; the Annual Reports on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, annual Departmental Reports, and the Report of the Royal Commission on Palestine, together with the volume of Memoranda prepared by the Government of Palestine for the Royal Commission and the Minutes of Evidence heard at the public sessions of the Royal Commission.
