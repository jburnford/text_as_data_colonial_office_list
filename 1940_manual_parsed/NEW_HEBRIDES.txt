Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, Seventh Day Adventists and Church of Christ, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia and by the Roman Catholic Church.

The principal exports are copra, cocoa, coffee, treos; maize, hides and various miscellaneous products are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 18th, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers, have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium Staff working in Departments under the joint control of the two Resident Commissioners.

The Customs Tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an ad valorem basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.

Of the import trade of the group about 49 per cent. is claimed by Australia, 26 per cent. by France, and the remainder by Britain, Japan, China and U.S.A., while the bulk of the exports are shipped to France.
