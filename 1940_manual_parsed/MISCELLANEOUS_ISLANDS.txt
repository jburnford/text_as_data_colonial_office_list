MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS.

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants, but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection, or for coconut planting. The rents are paid into the Exchequer. Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island and Cato Island (in the Norfolk Island Group), Raine Island, and Bell Cay (near British New Guinea), leased to Messrs. Grioe, Sumner, and Co., Caroline Island, Flint Island and Vostoc Island, (Pacific Ocean, 9° 56' S. lat., 150° 6' W. long., and 11° 26' S. lat., and 151° 48' W. long.), leased to S. R. Marwell and Co., Ltd. of New Zealand, Malden Island (4° 1' S. lat. 155° 57' W. long.) and Starbuck Island; and there are many others.
