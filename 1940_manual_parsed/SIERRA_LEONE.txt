SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The territory known as the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone is an area of some 27,926 square miles, roughly circular in shape, lying between 6° 55' and 10° of N. lat., and 10° 16' and 13° 18' of W. long. The sea coast, 210 miles in length, extends from Kiragba at 9° 2' on the border of French Guineas, to the Mano River at lat. 6° 55' N. on the border of the Republic of Liberia.

The Colony portion of this area, i.e. the territories acquired by the Crown by Treaty of Cession or otherwise consists of the following:—the Sierra Leone Peninsula in which is situated Freetown (the seat of Government), Sherbro Island, the Tasso, Banana, Turtle, Plantain and York Islands and other small islets, the Bake Lake, Mafoki and part of the Bure Chiefdoms in the Northern Province, and the Bumpe, Kagboro-Bagru, Mano Bagru, Timdel, Bendu, Cha, Nonkoba Bullom, Mesi Krim, and part of the Mano Sa Krim Chiefdoms in the Southern Province. The Crown has also acquired a strip of land, varying in depth from a quarter of a mile to one mile throughout the whole coast line not included in the areas specified above. Of these areas the Peninsula of Sierra Leone, Tasso Island, Banana Island, York Island, and the township of Bonthe in Sherbro Island, only, are administered as strictly Colony; the other areas are administered as part of the Protectorate.

History.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Nembanu and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor, of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs, and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government." This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 22nd August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who from various circumstances had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave-ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on the 10th July, 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on the 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Kwaiwa, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Kwaiwa country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the Treaty of Cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with
various Chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other Treaties of Cession were made from time to time.

On August 21st, 1896, a Proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the Hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate, which, by Order-in-Council is divided into two Provinces as follows:

Northern Province—Districts.—Port Loko, Bombali, Karene, Koinadugu and Tonkolili.

Southern Province—Districts.—Moyamba, Kono, Kenema, Kailahun, Bo, Bonteh and Pujehun.

General Description.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of igneous mountains, running parallel to these from N.N.W. to S.S.E., the summits of which, in the Picket Hill, Sugar Loaf and Leicester Mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of norite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The coastal strip is flat and low-lying and the river estuaries, below high tide mark, are bounded by extensive mangrove swamps. The western and southern part of the Protectorate consists of rolling wooded country, broken in places by ranges of hills rising to 1,000 ft. or more. The ground rises to the north and east to form an upland plateau having a general elevation of about 1,500 ft. The Sula and Kangari hills rise to nearly 3,000 ft., while to the east, near the French Guinea frontier, Bintumane Peak and the summits of the Tingi range rise to above 6,000 ft. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa the country is well watered by rivers and streams. The principal rivers of Sierra Leone which empty themselves into the Atlantic Ocean are the Great and Little Scarcies, the Rokel or Seli (or Sierra Leone river), the Jong or Taia, the Ribbi, the Bum or Sewa, the Moa and the Mano, most of which are navigable by small craft for several miles.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 2,900 feet above the sea. In 1931 it contained 54,958 inhabitants. It possesses one of the best harbours in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining have a population (including Freetown and its Districts) of 90,885. It yields only a small quantity of exportable commodities, but ginger and coffee thrive if well looked after. The extent of the territory is, however, small (236 square miles), and the generally rocky soil is not very well adapted for cultivation.

Considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piasava, with other articles of lesser importance are exported via Bonteh in the Southern Province as well as through Freetown.

Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, cocoanuts, beniseed, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, cocoa, rice, and other tropical products. Alluvial platinum deposits occur near York, and are being worked on a small scale. Alluvial gold in the Protectorate has attracted both companies and individuals. Gold mining is now being actively pursued and is already of great value to the country.

Chromite has been discovered in several parts of the Protectorate and the most promising deposit occurs in the Kambui Hills near Hangha. Prospecting operations are being carried out.

Diamonds are being mined in the Kono District and now form a very important industry in this country.

Two large deposits of iron ore occur and export on a large scale has commenced from Marampa. Preliminary work is now being undertaken in connection with the second, known as the Tonkolili deposits.

The native population of the Protectorate is estimated at 1,672,057 and is composed of the following tribes:

Northern Province Temnes, Limbas, Susus, Lokos, Fulas, Mandingos, Korankos, Yalunkas, Mendes, Sherbos, Konas,

Southern Province Krima, Gallinas, Golas, Vais, Kissis.

Constitution.

A Charter, issued on May 27th, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, established a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, revoked so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter, dated 17th of December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. By letters patent, dated 3rd April, 1913, and Royal Instructions, dated 4th May, 1922, there were constituted an Executive Council composed of the Officer in command of the troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and a Legislative Council, composed of the members of the Executive Council and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On March 7, 1913, an Imperial Order-in-Council was issued providing for the administration of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The Order applies to the territories, not being portions of the Colony of Sierra Leone, lying between the
sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude and the tenth and fourteenth degrees of west longitude, and beginning at the extreme southerly point of the Colony on the Anglo-Liberian boundary, as delimited under the provisions of the Anglo-Liberian Conventions, November 11, 1885, and January 21, 1911.

The Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of Sierra Leone is also the Governor of the Protectorate. Authority is given to the Governor by Ordinances passed in the Legislative Council to exercise and provide for giving effect to the powers and jurisdiction acquired by the Crown in Sierra Leone.

Letters Patent, dated the 28th January, 1924, revoked those issued on the 3rd April, 1913, and made fresh provision for the appointment of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and instructions issued under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet on the same date cancelled those of the 3rd April, 1913, and 4th May, 1922. An Order of the King in Council dated the 16th January, 1924, provided for a new and considerably enlarged Legislative Council, introducing an elective element and direct representation of Protectorate interests into the constitution of that Council for the first time in the history of Sierra Leone.

Climate.

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The shade temperature varies during the year from about 62° to 97°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur at the commencement and close of the rainy season. They are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp. The rainfall in Freetown for the year 1938 was 128-62 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from N.E. to S.E.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is trying, but conditions have been greatly improved in recent years through the efforts of the Medical and Sanitary Services, and if ordinary precautions are taken the risk of contracting malarial fever can be much reduced.

Vegetation and Agriculture.

The greater part of the country is covered by bush growth, the height of the bush varying with the length of time since the area was last cultivated. In the north, where the rainfall is less than that nearer the coast, the country passes from bush into orchard bush and grass. Wild oil palms and raphia palms provide some of the principal exports in the shape of palm kernels, palm oil and piazzava, while the semi-cultivated kola tree provides an important kola export to West African territories.

The agriculture of the country is still primitive, "shifting cultivation" being universally practised. Of recent years the utilisation of swamps for swamp rice has been advocated and steady propaganda has resulted in a remarkable spread in the growth of swamp rice all over the Protectorate. Owing to heavy rainfall there are innumerable swamps and considerable areas available for this form of cultivation.

The chief cultivated crops are rice, cassava, sorghums, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, benniseed, peppers, coffee, ginger, and cocoa, the last three being cultivated chiefly for export. These (excepting the last three) are the food crops of the country, the most important being rice which forms the staple food of the inhabitants of the Protectorate. In the Colony Peninsula, cassava products (chiefly foo-foo) displace rice to some extent as a food.

The agricultural exports for 1938 were as follows:

| Crop          | Quantity (Tons) | Value (£) |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Palm kernels  | 63,687         | 457,031  |
| Kola          | 1,450          | 29,785   |
| Palm oil      | 1,066          | 16,025   |
| Piazzava      | 3,791          | 40,369   |
| Ginger        | 2,705          | 60,880   |
| Rice          | 355            | 2,927    |
| Peppers       | 90             | 3,410    |
| Cocoa         | 384            | 5,849    |
| Benniseed     | 374            | 3,700    |

Minerals.

All minerals are vested in the Crown and rights to prospect for minerals and titles to mine minerals are issued through the Mines Department, Freetown. The mineral industry owes its inception to the discoveries made by the Government Geological Survey. The minerals mined at present are gold, platinum, diamonds and iron. The following is a comparative statement of the annual mineral production and its value:

| Year | Gold : Crude and unrefined Bullion (ozs. troy) | Platinum : Coarse Crude (ozs. troy) | Diamonds : (carats) | Iron Ore : Exports (tons) | Chrome Ore Exports (tons) | Estimated Value (£) |

Gold is mined from alluvial deposits in the Protectorate. An occurrence of lode gold is under active prospecting in the Pujehun area, Southern Province. Platinum is won in the Colony peninsula from stream gravels. Diamonds were first discovered in 1929 in the Nimi Koro chiefdom of Kono district. Diamondiferous alluvial deposits are very widespread. They are worked by a diamond mining company on a profit-sharing basis with Government. Iron ore is being mined at Marampa whence the ore is conveyed by a mineral railway some fifty miles to Pepel for shipment. Exploitation commenced in 1933. Government has lent more than £400,000 to the Marampa company, secured by first mortgage debentures on the property present and future and the uncalled capital of the company. Large iron ore deposits of good grade have been found in the Tonkolili area. These are to be exploited by the
Marampa company under an agreement by which a sliding scale royalty will be paid to Government. Other minerals which are being prospected or are known to exist are chromite, molybdenite, ilmenite, bauxite, lignite, corundum and garnet.

Customs.

The import duties, which make provision for preferential treatment to British goods, are mainly specific—a preference of 100 per cent. as a general rule being accorded to the British article. There are also export duties on palm kernels (20s. a ton), and kola nuts (£1. a lb.).

Currency and Banking.

Besides English currency, West Africa silver coins (2s., Is., 6d., and 3d.) were put into circulation in 1913, and alloy coins of similar denominations in 1920. Silver coinage is gradually being withdrawn. The alloy coinage which was put into circulation in 1920 is now also being withdrawn, a new form of alloy "security-edge" coinage having been introduced in January, 1939. The alloy 3d. piece was at the same time replaced by a nickel "security-edge" coin of larger dimensions. Currency Notes of the value of 20s. and 10s. were introduced in 1916 and of 2s. in 1917, and Is. in 1919, but the last two denominations are not now current. The Bank of British West Africa has two branches in the Colony and some agencies in the Protectorate. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial & Overseas) Ltd. also is established in Freetown. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882.

Education.

Throughout the 19th century facilities for education were provided in the Colony by religious bodies; financial assistance was given by Government. At present primary instruction is given in Amalgamated Mission Schools and in private schools. In the former Government receives the school fees, pays the salaries of teachers, and provides equipment. There are one Government Secondary School for boys and several assisted and unassisted Secondary Schools for boys and for girls. One Male and one Female Training College train teachers for Primary Schools. Fourah Bay College (of which the Church Missionary Society are Proprietors) is affiliated to Durham University and prepares students for degrees in Arts and Theology and for Teaching Diplomas. In the Protectorate educational development has been slow. There are two Government Boarding and one Government Day School of primary standard. In the Southern Province there are a number of Missionary primary schools, many of which receive Government assistance through Capitation grant. In the Northern Province there are only a few schools, whether assisted or unassisted. There is in the Protectorate one Protestant missionary institution for the training of teachers and evangelists. Throughout the country and particularly in the Northern part of the Protectorate there are numbers of Koranic schools giving religious instruction. The numbers of Government and Assisted schools and pupils at the end of 1938 in the Colony and Protectorate were as follows:

| Colony, Primary | 46 | 7,333 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| " Secondary | 8 | 1,173 |
| " Industrial | 1 | 71 |
| Total Colony | 55 | 8,632 |
| Protectorate, Primary | 100 | 8,242 |
| " Secondary | — | — |
| " Industrial | 1 | 95 |
| Total Protectorate | 101 | 8,337 |
| Total Sierra Leone | 156 | 16,969 |

Educational administration is governed by the Education Ordinance of 1938 and the Rules made thereunder. The Vernacular is used as the medium of instruction for one or two years in numerous schools in the Protectorate. Local Teachers' Certificates of Primary Grade are granted by the Education Department on the result of examinations held annually. Instruction in Domestic Science has received considerable attention in the girls' schools of Freetown and certificates of various grades are granted for proficiency.

Means of Communication.

Mail steamers leave Liverpool for Freetown and Freetown for Plymouth and Liverpool every fortnight. The passage takes about 10 days.

In 1939, Freetown, Sierra Leone, was included as an airport of call on the French Aeromaritime Service operating between Dakar and Point Noire weekly in each direction and also connecting with Air France Services from Dakar to Europe and South America. Airmails are exchanged between Sierra Leone and places abroad by means of these services. There is also alternative connection to South and East Africa and the Far East by Imperial Airways Service from Accra which is also included as an airport on the French Aeromaritime schedule. Cable and Wireless Limited owns and operates cable and wireless stations at Freetown whence telegraphic communication is maintained with all parts of the world through the Company's system and with ships at sea.

The main line of the Sierra Leone Government Railway, which was the first Railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the Freetown terminus to Pendembu in the Railway District, a distance of 227½ miles. The number of stations and flag stations is 53. From Banya Junction, 64½ miles from Freetown, a branch line runs to Makeni, a distance of 82½ miles. The gauge of the Railway is 2 ft. 6 in. The Marampa railway running from the iron ore deposits at Marampa to Pepel, the port of shipment, is 57½ miles long. The railway is open only for the transport of iron ore.

The total railway receipts for 1938 were 177,230L; the working expenses for the same year were 153,562L. There are 1,966 miles of combined telegraph and telephone lines in operation.

There are 850 miles of first-class roads in the Protectorate constructed and maintained by the Public Works Department, about 164 miles of Chiefs' roads of an inferior standard of construction and about 81 miles of roads constructed and maintained by private companies.

In the Colony peninsula there are about 124 miles of first-class roads including 21 miles with tarred surfaces mainly in Freetown and its vicinity.

The Sherbro river is navigable by ocean-going vessels as far as York Island, about 45 miles from the entrance, and the Sierra Leone river as far as Pepel, some 15 miles above Freetown.

The Great Scarcies river, the Little Scarcies river, the Port Loko Creek, the Ribbi river,
Bumpeh river, Cockboro river, Yaltukka river, Bagru river and Jong river are all navigable by small craft up to about 7 feet draft for from 20 to 30 miles from their entrances.

The Kittam River is navigable for launches to Mopaima (about 80 miles) all the year and for six months to Pujehun. Much of the produce from the Pujehun District is thus transported to Bonthe.

There are 70 post offices and postal agencies. The estimated number of letters, &c., handled in 1938 was 2,220,500; of parcels 38,636, of which the Inland Post dealt with 1,346,100 and 14,296 respectively.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Post Newspapers, Books, etc., per ½ oz. | Cards, per 3 oz. |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Internal                                         | d.              |

Parcels for other countries except U.S.A. and Liberia are forwarded through the U.K.

British Imperial Postal Orders are issued and paid in the Colony; there is also an Inland and Foreign Money Order Service.

At the close of 1938 the Post Office Savings Bank held £90,017L to the credit of 14,459 depositors.
