NORTHERN RHODESIA.

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambezi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 284,746 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into six Provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Lusaka, to which the principal departmental headquarters were moved from Livingstone in May, 1935. Other important settlements are at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Mazabuka, Ndola, near which the copper mines of Nchanga, Nkana, Roan Antelope, and Mufulira are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery, and Mongu in Barotseland.

History and Constitution.

The first explorations north of the Zambezi were carried out by various Portuguese travellers at the end of the eighteenth century. The first British person to enter Northern Rhodesia was Dr. Livingstone who reached the Zambezi in 1855. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interceptioned on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika Province of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 25th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924, the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Financial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Senior Provincial Commissioner, and the Director of Medical Services. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and seven unofficial elected members and one unofficial member nominated to represent native interests. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, G.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen, who function as Native Authorities and Courts. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District Officers. The Barotse Province is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to
apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied.

Administrative Officers in their capacities as Magistrates of Subordinate Courts have a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from Subordinate Courts of the 3rd Class to Provincial Commissioners' Courts and from Subordinate Courts (including Provincial Commissioners' Courts) of the 1st and 2nd Classes to the High Court.

Education.

European.—For the education of European children there were in August, 1939, controlled Schools at Livingstone, Choma, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Broken Hill, Ndola, Luanshya, Kitwe and Mufulira, offering primary education up to Standard VII, with the additional subjects, Latin, French, Algebra, Geometry and Science in Standards VI and VII. There were schools at Chomba, Silver Rest, Chingola and Fort Jameson, offering primary education up to Standard V. All these schools were under Government management. The Convent School, Broken Hill, offering education up to the standard of the Matriculation Examination, Mulobesi School, Sakeji School and the Convent Schools at Livingstone, Lusaka and Ndola, offering primary education up to Standard V, were controlled but under private management.

Boarding accommodation was available for girls at the Beit School, Choma, for boys at the Codrington School, Mazabuka, and for boys and girls at Lusaka School, all under Government management, and, for girls, at the Convent Schools at Broken Hill and Ndola, under private management. There was also open during the year a number of uncontrolled schools with small enrolments and uncertain lives.

Native.—The Department of Native Education supervises the educational work of the Missionary Societies working in the Territory, and apportions the grants in aid of the Mission Schools which conform to the Government syllabus and requirements. There is an Advisory Board on Native Education upon which Missions, Settlers and Government Departments are represented.

There are 430 Schools receiving grants in aid. Of these 12 are Teacher Training Institutions with Senior primary classes attached, and 24 are Girls' Boarding Schools in charge of European Headmistresses. Some 36,000 children attend these schools while a further 86,000 are enrolled at 1,600 unassisted Schools which do not possess qualified teachers.

The Government Schools include a Jeanes Training School, a Trades School and a Teacher Training School. There are also 12 other Government Schools, 3 of which are District Headquarters Schools and the remainder are in Industrial Centres. Four of these are run by the United Missions in the Copperbelt as agents for the Government. Some 2,500 children attend the schools in the Copperbelt.

The Barotse National School, founded in 1907, and financed by the Barotse Native Treasury, with its subsidiary School at Mankoya, was until recently the only Native Authority School. Five new Native Authority Schools have been opened in the past 18 months.

Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from May to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° F. to 90° F., with a maximum of 103° F. and a minimum of 68° F. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 65° F. to 75° F., with a maximum of 86° F. and a minimum of 40° F. In some parts the maximum temperature has reached the high figure of 120° F., whilst minima of 30° F. or less are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from over 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 inches or less in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period May to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70% to 90% of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again.

Agriculture.

The cattle and ranching industries are gradually attaining a more satisfactory position owing to increased fencing and better cattle-management amongst European-owned stock and to the dipping which is in progress amongst Native-owned stock in the Reserves.

The cattle of the Territory are singularly free from the major stock diseases. Contagious Bovine Pleuro-pneumonia is enzootic, however, in the Barotse Province. The campaign for the eradication of this disease from the Barotse Province has definitely decreased its incidence and the campaign is continuing. Mortality from any cause is low upon those farms and ranches where good cattlemastership is practised.

The dairy industry has not developed to the extent which the local markets require. A cooperative creamery is in operation at Lusaka and it has no difficulty in marketing all its products.

The greater portion of the Territory is undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in its food supply, practically the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little general trade in food commodities except in the railway belt where the surplus native maize crop is marketed by the Maize Control Board. The staple native cereals are finger-millet (Eleocharis coracana), Kaffir-corn (Sorghum), and Maize. The former is produced over extensive tracts of the Territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby grain crops are grown in rotation with forest re-growths. Other native crops are
bulrush millet (*Pennisetum typhoideum*), ground-nuts, cassava, sweet-potatoes, and a variety of pumpkins, gourds, and beans. Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but on a small scale for private consumption and a small localized trade only. Considerable numbers of cattle are owned by natives in the Territory, but these are mainly confined to certain tribes, notably the Marosi, Baila, Matoka, and, to a less extent, the Angoni in North-eastern Rhodesia.

Many parts of the Territory are impassable to animal transport owing to the presence of tse-tse fly.

In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management.

Maize is the chief crop of the settler. In the season 1938-39, 42,000 acres were planted and the total crop was 206 thousand bags, of which 50 thousand were retained for farm consumption.

As a result of Agreements with Southern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa the internal market is protected against imported maize and cattle offered at unduly low prices.

Experimental work on the problems of cotton cultivation is being continued with the assistance of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation. Cultivation by European farmers is not at present recommended owing to the serious losses caused by insect pests. The work, however, has been extended to include experiments in certain native areas where it is believed that commercial production may be possible.

Flue-cured Virginian tobacco is produced chiefly in the Fort Jameson district. The crop reached 2 million pounds in the 1937-38 season. The better qualities of leaf are exported and, as the result of agreements with Southern Rhodesian manufacturers and the Union of South Africa, an African market exists for about 600,000 pounds of Northern Rhodesian leaf annually.

Most of the wheat produced in the Territory is handled by the Co-operative Society at Lusaka and is exported to Bulawayo for milling.

The headquarters of the Agricultural Department and the Veterinary Department are at Mazabuka.

**Forestry.**

More than 60 per cent. of the entire area of Northern Rhodesia is estimated to be more or less covered with trees and shrubs, but the forest growth, chiefly of the Savannah Woodland type, is undergoing considerable modification in composition and area as a result of native shifting cultivation and annual fires. A Forestry Branch of the Agricultural Department was instituted in 1929. Certain areas are being maintained as protection forests for the prevention of soil erosion and the preservation of water supplies in springs and rivers. Further areas are dedicated to the production of timber of the more useful indigenous species. Small experimental plantations of fast growing exotic tree species have been established.

The only large commercial timber industry in the Territory at present is that of the Zambesi Saw Mills Ltd., whose operations extend from Livingstone to the Machili River under concessions granted by the Government. This Company is chiefly concerned with the extraction, by light railway, of timbers of the Kalahari sand belt type, including Mukushi, *Baikiaea plurijuga*; Mukwa, *Pterocarpus angolensis*; Mwanagura, *Pterocarpus stevensoni*; Mupumena, *Entandrophragma sp.*; Mkamba, *Afzelia quanzensis*; Mugongo *Ricinodendron raoulense*; and Musheshe, *Burkea africana*. The Company has contracts for supplying Mukushi sleepers to the South African and Rhodesian Railways.

**Land Settlement.**

An Agricultural Survey Commission reported in 1932 upon the unalienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European settlement, and this Commission has advised as to the class of farming or ranching for which the land is suitable. The Government is not embarking on any extensive programme of land settlement. Crown Land and privately owned land, however, suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 2s. and 15s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on lease with option to purchase. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Application for land in Northern Rhodesia, should be addressed to the Commissioner for Lands, Livingstone.

**Minerals.**

The Department of Lands, Mines, and Surveys administers the Mining Law and the Registration of Mining Titles Ordinance subsidiary thereto and the Mining and Explosives Regulations. The Registry of Mining Titles is kept, duty assessed, and the necessary searches are made.

The production of copper, which is the major mineral industry of the territory, has been stabilised by the Copper Restriction Agreement of 1935, by which the tonnage of copper produced is varied to control market prices. Early in 1936 the quota allowed the industry was 70 per cent. of its basic tonnage output but during the year the increased consumption of copper resulting from rearmament programmes and trade recovery reduced the world stocks and the quota was progressively increased to 106 per cent. During 1937 the price of copper fluctuated considerably, but owing to the Restriction agreement, the mines were able to divert their labour from production to mine development, instead of curtailing their activities. The price of copper in 1938 was much more stable than in the previous year, the quota restrictions being fixed at the following percentages of basic tonnages:—January 1st to June 30th, 105 per cent.; July 1st to October 14th, 95 per cent.; October 15th to December 14th, unrestricted; and December 15th to December 31st, 106 per cent. In November the Territory's production of blister copper reached the record figure of 19,902 tons, a record only to be broken, despite the re-imposition of quota restrictions, by the December output of 20,963 tons. The total value of copper production for each of these months exceeded £1,000,000.

The copper produced in the Territory in 1938 totalled 213,031 tons valued at £8,858,629, as against 208,172 tons valued at £11,564,000, in 1937. The production of the various copper mines in 1938 was: Mufulira 60,220 tons of blister copper; Roan Antelope, 71,930 tons of blister copper; Nkana, 49,514 tons of blister copper and 31,367 tons of electrolytic copper. As bye-products, Nkana also produced 3,221,357 lbs. of cobalt, 420 ozs. of gold, 87,884 ozs. of silver, and 4,078 lbs. of selenium. Nchanga Copper Mine is being developed for large scale production. One vertical and two inclined shafts have been sunk, pumping has commenced in the old flooded workings and two turbo-alternators have been put into operation, but it will be some time before the mine is in full production.
Lead, zinc and vanadium are mined at Broken Hill. The market price of zinc was unattractive during 1938, and production was curtailed, but 823,626 lbs. of vanadium were produced, valued at £260,816l., almost double the value of the previous year's vanadium output. The lead produced is made into pipes and sheets for use in the leaching plant. The production of lead and zinc for 1938 was: lead, 273 tons valued at £4,308l.; zinc, 10,215 tons, valued at £141,701l. The sinking of a three-compartment pumping shaft to its final depth of 1,115 feet has been completed, and excavations for the pump chambers and sumps are being made.

Other mineral activities are small, gold-mining in particular being very disappointing with only some 700 ozs. produced apart from the Nkana mine output. Small quantities of mica and alluvial tin were produced.

The mineral production for the years 1937 and 1938 was:

| Mineral          | 1937       | 1938       |
|------------------|------------|------------|
| Gold             | 4,228 ozs. | 1,113 ozs. |
| Silver           | 83,861     | 88,237     |
| Blister Copper   | 177,432    | 181,664    |
| Electro Copper   | 30,740     | 31,367     |
| Copper in matte  | 15         | Nil        |
| Zinc             | 14,031     | 10,215     |
| Vanadium         | 518,727 lbs.| 823,626 lbs.|
| Manganese Ore    | 2,341 tons | 2,735 tons |
| Tin Ore          | 520        | Nil        |
| Lead             | 559        | 273        |
| Cobalt           | 1,949,837 lbs.| 3,221,357 lbs.|
| Mica             | 8,928      | 8,620      |
| Tin Concentrates | 7-75 tons  | 4-25 tons  |

The estimated value of the mineral production was:

| Year | Value       |
|------|-------------|
| 1937 | £12,751,014 |
| 1938 | £10,883,715 |

The reduction in this figure is more than accounted for by the lower average price of copper.

Means of Communication.

The Railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambezi is crossed by a single span bridge, 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have now been constructed from Ndola to Luanshya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nehanga via Nkana, a distance of 84 miles. Another line runs from Mokamba, in the Belgian Congo, to Mufulira, nine miles distant.

Road communications have been improved and the arterial road system has been bridged and culverted with permanent structures.

The main arterial roads are:

(i) The "Great North Road" from Livingstone via Lusaka, Broken Hill and Kapiri Mposhi, where the road leaves the Railway, to Mpika, Kasama and Abercorn, a distance of 986 miles, with a connection to Mwenzo, another 118 miles, where the road joins the Tanganyika and Nyasaland road systems.

(ii) The "Great East Road," which runs from Lusaka eastward to Fort Jameson and the Nyasaland Border, a distance of 381 miles. This road crosses the Luangwa River at 157 miles from Lusaka by an imposing bridge presented to the Territory by the Beit Trust.

(iii) The Congo Border Road, which branches from the Great North Road 3 miles north of Kapiri Mposhi and proceeds north to Ndola and the Copper Mining Area and from there on to Solwezi, Kasempa and Mumbwa, joining the Great North Road again 44 miles north of Lusaka, the total distance being 675 miles. The Kafue River is crossed near Nkana by another large bridge presented by the Beit Trust.

In addition to the above main roads there is a large mileage of secondary roads serving the settled areas and districts.

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambesi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aviation.

The main air routes are as follows:

(i) Livingstone to Balovale (or intermediate stations) via Sesheke, Njoko, Sioma, Senanga, and Mongu.

(ii) Livingstone to Ndola (or intermediate stations) via Kalomo, Choma, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Chisamba, Broken Hill and Kapiri Mposhi.

(iii) Lusaka to Fort Jameson via Nyangwena, Rufunsa, Nyimbe and Sasare.

(iv) Broken Hill to Mbeya (or intermediate stations) via Mtuga, Ndabala, Kanona (for Serenje), Kalonje, Mpika, Shiwa Ngandu, Chinsali, Isoka and Mwenimpanza.

(v) Broken Hill to Abercorn via Mtnga, Ndabala, Kanona, Kalonje, Mpika, Kasama and Rosa.

(vi) Ndola to Mbeya (or intermediate stations) via Kapiri Mposhi, Mtuga, Ndabala, Kanona, Kalonje, Mpika, Shiwa Ngandu, Chinsali, Isoka and Mwenimpanza.

(vii) Ndola to Abercorn via Kapiri Mposhi, Mtuga, Ndabala, Kanona, Kalonje, Mpika, Kasama and Rosa.

(viii) Abercorn to any line of rail station via Rosa, Kasama, Mpika, Kalonje, Kanona, Ndabala, Mtuga, Broken Hill and then to the required destination via the railway line.

(ix) Lusaka to Mongu via Mumbwa, Kafue Hook, Nkoyama, Mankoya, Singala, and Loma.

Lusaka Airport is equipped with a hangar capable of accommodating all types of aircraft. There is also a ground staff in residence.

Hangars are available for small aircraft at Livingstone and Ndola, the former housing two aircraft, the latter one only.

Posts, Telegraphs and Wireless.

There is a daily mail service by rail between offices on the line of rail. Offices off the line of rail receive and despatch mails at least once a week. Mails for Fort Jameson, Mankoya, Mongu-Lealui (Barotseland), and Mumbwa are carried by air vehicle and from Lusaka. Other cross posts are by motor vehicle or carriers. Mails to and from adjoining countries are despatched by all mail trains and letter mails are also forwarded by Empire Air Mail and other air services. Letter mails exchanged with Empire countries and air mails for other countries are forwarded by the Empire Air Mail Service three times a week, connection with the main service being made at Beira or Kisumu by feeder services. Seaborne mails are forwarded via Cape Town but there is also a parcels post service once a fortnight via Lobito Bay.

There are 44 Post Offices, 15 of which are Money Order Offices and 24 are Telegraph Offices. The main telegraph and telephone route lies alongside the railway line from Victoria Falls to the Congo Border with branches from Ndola to Luanshya and Ndola to Chingola and Mufulira via Kitwe.

Wireless stations at Abercorn, Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Kasama, Mpika and Mongu-Lealui maintain a public service while stations at Kasama, Livingstone, Lusaka and Ndola are equipped for communication with air-craft in flight on 900 metres as well as for point to point working on short-waves.
Customs Duties.

The Tariff, excluding the Congo Basin tariff, provides for Empire preference for the following classes of goods which are mainly liable to ad valorem rates of duty; clothing, blankets and rugs, cotton piece goods, motor cars, and all articles usually imported for household and native use, the duty on Empire products being in almost every instance 10 per cent, and the duty on foreign varying from 15 to 30 per cent.; in the case of cotton and silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, and rubber shoes, from foreign countries, the tariff provides for additional or alternative specific rates if the duty should be greater at such rates. Agricultural, electrical, mining and other industrial machinery, pipes and piping, metals and metal manufactures imported for industrial purposes, if of Empire manufacture are free of duty and if foreign are subject to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent., except foreign electrical machinery which is 10 per cent.

Specific rates of duty apply to practically all imported foodstuffs, lubricating oils, paraffin and cement, and to spirits, wines, beer and tobacco; upon the latter items, apart from rum, bitters, beer and cigars, no preference is granted except under the terms of the customs agreements with the neighbouring territories in the South, but varying rates of preference are granted, under the tariff, to foodstuffs of British origin.
