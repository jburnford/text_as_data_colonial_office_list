THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of the Leeward Islands, with a total area of 708 square miles, consists of a number of islands belonging partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands Group) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. The islands of Antigua, Barbuda, St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Montserrat form a fairly compact group between the 61st and 63rd degree of west longitude and around the 17th degree of north latitude; but Anguilla, Sombrero, and still more the Virgins group (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, etc.), lie apart to the north and north-west.

St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, whilst Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Politically the Colony is divided into four Presidencies—Antigua (with Barbuda), St. Christopher and Nevis (with Anguilla), Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. These have been united and separated at various times in their history, and were finally...
federated in 1871 by Imperial Act 34 and 35 Vict., cap. 107. Sombrero was added to the Colony by Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act on the 16th August, 1904, being attached to the Virgin Islands Presidency, and later transferred to St. Christopher and Nevis.

On 1st January, 1940, Dominica, which had been a Presidency of the Colony of the Leeward Islands, was separated and became a Colony of the Windward Islands.

History.

The islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned that they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Presidencies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to January.

Constitution.

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now four) presidencies. The Legislative Council now consists of ten official members; seven elected members, and one nominated member (Virgin Islands). Three elected members are chosen by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Antigua, three by those of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis, and one by those of the Legislative Council of Montserrat. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. As there is no Legislative Council in the Virgin Islands, one member is appointed by the Governor to represent that Presidency. The official members are the Governor, the Attorney-General, the Federal Treasurer, the Administrator of St. Kitts, Nevis, the Administrator of Antigua, who is also Federal Secretary of the Colony, and the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, such other persons holding office under the Government of the Colony of the Leeward Islands as the Governor with the approval of the Secretary of State may appoint, and one other number appointed to balance the nominated Virgin Islands unofficial member.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation, and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts for about one week.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the Legislative Body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act. Constitutional changes involving the Electoral principle with unofficial majorities in the Presidential Councils came into being in 1937.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada have branches in Antigua and St. Kitts, and the latter bank has a branch in Montserrat. In Nevis and the Virgin Islands there are no banks.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational in Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, the various denominations being Anglicans, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics. In the other Parishes elementary education is provided by the Government. On 31st December, 1938, there were 117 aided and Government schools in the Colony. The clergy of the various denominations are granted facilities for giving religious instruction during school hours to the children of their respective churches. During the year 1938, the Government grants to all the elementary schools in the Colony amounted to £20,631. 5s. 9½d.

School fees have now been abolished in all public elementary schools throughout the colony. The schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. In the 117 aided and Government schools there were enrolled on 31st December, 1938, 26,637 children, with a daily average attendance of 18,363. For secondary education there are Government grammar schools for boys in St. Kitts, and for boys and girls in Montserrat, private grammar schools for boys in Antigua, private girls’ high schools in Antigua and St. Kitts, and private mixed schools in Antigua, Nevis and St. Kitts (convent).

The standard of the secondary schools is the Cambridge School Certificate.

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is officially recognised as 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 902) and Redonda are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62½ square miles. Barbuda lies about 25 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 miles, is very flat, with a large lagoon on the
west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was long owned by the Codrington family. It produces sea island cotton, charcoal, salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing and horse rearing. Cotton is being grown with favourable results. Deer were introduced by the Codringtons. The island has communication with Antigua by a sailing-boat service. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 25 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 25° 6' N. lat., 61° 36' W. long., 1 mile by ½ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered in 1865, formerly worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license and subject to an annual rental of £6L.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria de la Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1683 Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, but there are a few springs and many wells, and the island has not latterly been subjected to the droughts from which it suffered in the past. The island is in the main low-lying and has no forests. Rainfall:

On the 22nd March, 1898, the Legislative Council, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated by the Governor, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new Council consists of sixteen members, eight official and eight non-official, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Governor presided. By Ordinance No. 20 of 1936 the Council was reconstituted and the Council is now composed of the Administrator as President, 2 other officials, 3 nominated and 5 elected members.

The chief products are sugar and cotton. In 1938, 12,881 acres were under sugar-cane, 1,300 under cotton, 1,381 under provisions, and 53,418 were uncultivated.

St. John, the chief town, has a population of 6,997 (census of 1921), and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1938, 18 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 226.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.
This Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Anguilla. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.
The total population on 31st December, 1938, was estimated at 37,500, as compared with 38,214 at the census of 1921. The total area is about 152 square miles.
Constitution and Government.

In 1625 Mr. (afterwards Sir Thomas) Warner landed in St. Christopher, bearing a Royal Commission to the Earl of Carlisle, by which the islands of St. Christopher (or Merwar's Hope), Nevis, Barbados and Montserrat were taken under royal protection, and given over to his custody as the King's Lieutenant.

In 1671 St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla "and all the other Leeward Islands" were separated from Barbados and created the "Leeward Caribbean Islands Government," and Sir Charles Wheler was appointed "Captain-General" of the same. The chief seat of government was then at Nevis, but afterwards transferred to Antigua, and the government of each island, in the absence of the Captain-General, was administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, or, when none such was appointed, by the President of the Council.

In 1689 Colonel Christopher Codrington was appointed Governor-in-Chief, and his Commission, granted by William III., and dated 20th October, 1689, authorised him to call assemblies of freeholders and planters within any of the islands "jointly and severally to make laws for the public peace, welfare and good government of the said islands," thus providing for separate and federal legislatures. The Legislature in St. Christopher and in Nevis, as in the other islands of the government, consisted of two houses, a nominated Council and an elected Assembly, and had secured to it its own peculiar laws and local jurisdiction.

By Letters Patent, dated 26th April, 1816, the Commission originally granted to Sir William Stapleton was revoked, and the Leeward Caribbean Islands formed into two distinct governments, the first comprising Antigua, Montserrat and Barbuda, and the other St. Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd November, 1832, the General Government was restored, Dominica being for the first time included, and a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, with two Lieutenant-Governors for St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, and for Dominica respectively, were appointed, each island possessing a Legislative Council and House of Assembly, which continued, under the supervision of the Governor-in-Chief, to legislate for local interests.

In 1866 measures were introduced in each island to alter the constitution, and the two houses then existing were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, consisting of ex-officio members, nominees of the Crown, and representatives of the people elected under a limited franchise.

In 1878 the single chamber constitution was repealed in St. Kitts and in Nevis, and the Crown Colony form of government adopted in its stead, and in 1882 these two islands, with Anguilla, were united into one Presidency.

The office of Lieutenant-Governor, which existed until 1870, has been abolished, and the Presidency, in the absence thereof from the Governor, is under the immediate supervision of an Administrator.

There is one Executive Council for the Presidency, consisting of the Governor, the Administrator, certain ex-officio members, and such other persons as His Majesty may from time to time appoint. The Legislative Council consists of two official, three nominated unofficial members and five elected members, besides the Administrator. Of the elected members three are representatives of the electoral district of the island of St. Christopher, one represents the island of Nevis and one Anguilla. These members are elected by ballot by voters of the electoral districts they respectively represent. As no residential qualification is necessary it is possible for a person from any one of the islands, provided he is a registered voter and is standing for election, to be elected to represent any one of the other districts. Each island is a separate electoral district. The President of the Council enjoys a casting vote in the event of a tie in the votes of members at a meeting. The Council meets at the town of Basseterre in St. Kitts.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

Sugar is the principal crop in St. Kitts (262,501 tons of cane in 1938 crop, from 9,665 acres, 37,160 tons of sugar manufactured). It is grown in the Basseterre Valley and on the lower slopes round the island (the northern side showing the best average yield), and the cane is crushed and sugar produced at a central factory a mile from Basseterre. A light railway for haulage of canes encircles the island.

The only other important crop in St. Kitts is cotton, the lint produced in 1938 being 385,130 lbs. on 1,440 acres.

Cotton and coconuts are the chief products exported from Nevis. Small quantities of tomatoes are also exported to Canada during the winter months.

Vegetables and cattle, chiefly for export to St. Kitts and for local consumption, are also produced in Nevis.

Salt is the chief product of Anguilla, and is also produced from ponds at the south eastern part of St. Kitts, the quantity from Anguilla in 1937 being 2,619 tons valued at 2,968£.

Anguilla also produces cotton in small quantities.

There are no manufacturing industries (other than the manufacture of sugar) in the Presidency.

The Customs import tariff is mainly on an ad valorem basis with a surtax of 12½%. A preferential reduction varying in amount, but in most cases equal to one third of the general rate, is accorded to Empire products. The percentage of trade in 1938 is as follows:

|                |        |
|----------------|--------|
| United Kingdom | 39     |
| Other British countries | 40   |
| U.S. of America | 12     |
| Other foreign countries | 9    |

Education.

There are four secondary schools:—a Government grammar school for boys in St. Kitts, a girls' high school in St. Kitts and a mixed school in Nevis, both state-aided, and a school by the Roman Catholic Sisters.

There are 31 Government primary schools (16 in St. Kitts, including 4 in Basseterre, 10 in Nevis and 5 in Anguilla) and also a Roman Catholic school and a few small private schools.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land, within which are the salt ponds.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.
The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 3,711 feet above the sea. A branch of this range encloses the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the principal town, with a population of about 8,000. Near the town of Sandy Point is Brimstone Hill, strongly fortified and fiercely besieged during the French wars. It is quite isolated, and about 750 feet in height.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island. The higher slopes of the mountains are covered with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood. The island is of volcanic formation, and the soil, save in the mountains (where it is clayey) is peculiarly light and porous, sandy yet fertile.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The highest temperature in the shade is about 88°, the lowest 66°, and the mean average about 79°.

The average rainfall in St. Kitts for the year 1938 was 58.38 inches.

St. Christopher or St. Kitts, the Carib name of which was Liamuiga, "The Fertile Isle," was the first settled of the British West Indies, the settlement having been founded by Mr. Thomas Warner and other settlers, who landed on the 28th January, 1623, at the present village of Old Road. Later, French settlements were formed at the two ends of the island. The whole island was finally assigned to England under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17°40' N. lat., and 62°33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonised by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, has a population of about 1,100. The population of Nevis largely consists of peasant proprietors.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 15,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,596 feet above the sea.

The soil is very different from that of St. Kitts, being of stiff clay, encumbered everywhere with volcanic boulders.

There are hot mineral springs adjoining the Bath House Hotel near Charlestown. These springs have valuable medicinal properties.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Kitts, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which, however, lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands. The distance between Basseterre (St. Kitts) and Charlestown (Nevis) is about twelve miles.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is situated in 18°12' N. lat., and 63°5' W. long., about 60 miles N.W. of St. Kitts, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

Unlike the mountainous volcanic islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla consists of Oligocene limestone and clay and its highest point is 213 ft. above sea level.

The inhabitants are peasant proprietors under the jurisdiction of a medical officer who is also magistrate.

The island is healthy, but suffers from want of an adequate water supply.

Besides sheep and goats the chief product is salt. Sea Island cotton is cultivated.

Montserrat.

This Island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 32½ square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Chance's Mt. (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of 1,730, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1938, 4 sailing vessels, total tonnage 112 tons net.

Montserrat was colonised by the Irish in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1783.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. In 1861, these were replaced by a single Chamber of eight elected and four nominated members.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th December, 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th February, 1867, this Chamber was replaced by a Legislative Council of not more than six nominated members. By Act No. 2, of 1902, which rescinded these Acts, the number of members was limited to four. Ordinance No. 4 of 1909 repealed No. 2 of 1902 and limited the tenure of office of the members of the Council to three years. Ordinance No. 2 of 1911 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number of members to six. Ordinance No. 18 of 1922 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number to eight. By Act No. 16 of 1936 this Council was reconstituted, substituting for the old Council a body consisting of the Commissioner as President, two official members, four elected Unofficial members, and two nominated Unofficial members. Unofficial representation on the General Legislative Council of the L.I. has now been provided for.

The cultivation of sugar, once the staple industry of the island, has declined, and Sea Island cotton, tomatoes, onions and limes are now the principal products.

Among the other exports may be mentioned lime oils, lime juice, cotton-seed oil, cattle and vegetables.

There are thirteen denominational schools with 3,037 scholars.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects.

On 7th August, 1899, the island was devastated by a hurricane; and again on 28th August, 1924, and 12th September, 1928.

A series of seismo-volcanological disturbances occurred during the years 1933 to 1935 causing much damage to stone and mortar buildings.

There is telephonic communication throughout the Island.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited operates the wireless station from which services are conducted with the Company's stations at Antigua and Barbados, where connection is made, via Canada, with all parts of the world through the system of Cable and Wireless Limited. A Coast Station is also maintained for communication with ships at sea.

The island is considered to be one of the most healthy of the Antilles.

The average rainfall at the Grove Botanic Station, taken for 35 years, is 61.75 inches.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to eastward of and adjacent to Puerto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dykes, Peter Island, Salt Island, and all others not in the possession of the United States of America. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. A lighthouse is maintained by the Board of Trade on Sombrero, which was first included in the Colony in 1904.

The Americans possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the Constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted, to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members, to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government. This Ordinance was repealed May 1st, 1902, since when the Governor of the Leeward Islands ordains the laws. There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Road Town, Tortola, population (1921) 437, which is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1938, 10 vessels, registered total tonnage, 97.

Road Town, which is well built and clean, is provided with well stocked shops and stores. There is a small modern Hospital.

The cultivation of Sea Island cotton, once the principal industry of the Virgin Islands, abandoned in consequence of the low prices, has been recommenced on a small scale.

A small quantity of sugar is made for local consumption, also rum.

The percentage of import trade with the United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empire and the principal Foreign countries is 17%, 13% and 70% respectively. Under the Customs Tariff the preferential rate charged on imports from Empire countries is in general two-thirds of the general rate.

A large area of land in the Virgin Islands is well adapted to coconut cultivation, and the existing trees are quite free from any serious insect or fungoid pests.

The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy, intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their trade and intercourse is with the Virgin Islands of the U.S., and to a smaller extent with San Domingo and St. Martin.

The currency consists largely of foreign money, which circulates at the varying rates of exchange.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great. The average annual rainfall at Road Town is about 54 inches.

The birth and death rates per 1,000 in 1938 were 29·9 and 19·0 respectively.

Large quantities of fibrous plants (agaves and bromelias) grow wild everywhere in Tortola.

The mail communication is weekly by Government motor launch to St. Thomas. Mails are also despatched to St. Thomas nearly every day, letters for Europe being usually sent via Puerto Rico and New York weekly.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited owns and operates cable stations at St. Thomas and St. Croix which are connected by cables with the British West Indies and thence, via Canada, with all parts of the world, through the system of Cable and Wireless Limited.
