BAHAMAS.

Situation and Area.

The Bahamas, the most northerly of the British West Indian Colonies, are an archipelago of islands, cays and rocks lying between 20° 51' and 27° 25' north lat. and 72° 57' and 80° 32' west long. and extending from Inagua on the South to Matanilla Reef on the North; from Mayaguana and its adjacent rocks and cays on the East to, and including, the Cay Sal Bank on the West, and separated from Florida, to the West, by the Straits of Florida, and from Cuba, to the South, by the Old Bahama and Nicholas Channels. About 20 of the islands are inhabited. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Cat Island, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, the Biminis, and Watling's Island (or San Salvador), all of which are ports of entry; and Great Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklin Island, Mayaguana, the Berry Islands, and Andros Island (containing the only river). The total area is 4,375 square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

History.

San Salvador, so called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had any settlements on any of the islands of this group at any time. Early in the 17th century the islands were well known to the settlers of Bermuda and the Carolinas. They were included in the Royal Grant of Sir Robert Heath, the Attorney-General of England, of the 30th of October, 1629. By 1640 the islands had become a well-known place of resort by the inhabitants of Bermuda, and on the 9th of July, 1647, The Company of Eleutherian Adventurers was formed in London for the purpose of making an organised attempt at a systematic colonization and development of the islands. William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, was the moving spirit of this venture, and associated with him were a number of influential city merchants and Members of Parliament. On the 31st of August, 1649, Parliament, on the petition of Sayle and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands," which constituted Sayle and his associates the Proprietors of the Islands. Notwithstanding the Royal Grant to Heath in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles the Second, on the 1st of November, 1670, granted the Islands to Six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, namely, the Duke of Albemarle, the Earl of Craven, Lord Berkley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret and Sir Peter Colleton. Before the Royal Grant of 1670 the inhabitants of the islands had organised the Settlement and instituted a form of Government which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected Captain John Wentworth as their Governor. Wentworth applied to and received Commissions from the Governors of Jamaica. The Lords Proprietors appointed Hugh Wentworth as their first Governor on 24th April, 1671, but he did not take up the appointment. They then confirmed in office John Wentworth, the popularly elected Governor, on the 26th of December, 1671. A regular system of government was established including a Parliament, the Lower House of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the Civil and Military Government of the Islands was resumed by the Crown on the surrender of their rights by the Lords Proprietors on the 28th October, 1717. Thirteen Proprietary Governors were appointed between 1671 and 1715. The Settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1683 nearly all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the Settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica, under the leadership of Thomas Bridges. Bridges was recognised as Governor by the Lords Proprietors on the 12th July, 1688, and the Settlement had reached some importance when it was practically annihilated by the French and Spaniards in 1703. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned to New Providence and another Proprietary Governor was appointed in 1707. But the Islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the Civil and Military Government of the place, and thus accede to the numerous

BAHAMAS.

Situation and Area.

The Bahamas, the most northerly of the British West Indian Colonies, are an archipelago of islands, cays and rocks lying between 20° 51' and 27° 25' north lat. and 72° 57' and 80° 32' west long. and extending from Inagua on the South to Matanilla Reef on the North; from Mavaguana and its adjacent rocks and cays on the East to, and including, the Cay Sal Bank on the West, and separated from Florida, to the West, by the Straits of Florida, and from Cuba, to the South, by the Old Bahama and Nicholas Channels. About 20 of the islands are inhabited.

petitions which the inhabitants had been making for several years and also carry out the express wishes of Parliament. Since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The Islands were surrendered to a Fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1781, but they had been re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux before the conclusion of the war; which was brought to an end by the Peace of Versailles, 1783, when the British possession was confirmed. After the American Revolution a number of Loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas Group and received substantial assistance from England, and on the 19th of March, 1787, the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

The Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, and which had often in their early history been claimed both by Bermuda and the Bahamas, were separated from the other Bahamas in 1848, and formed into a distinct Presidency, under the government-in-chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is salubrious and very pleasant in the winter season, and the Colony has in recent years been much frequented by visitors from the United States and Canada, there being excellent hotels and other accommodation for tourists. The cost of living is very high; houses are difficult to obtain and rentals are high. The average annual rainfall is about 46 inches, the rainy season extending from June to October. From November to May the temperature averages 70° Fahrenheit, there is little rain, and cool breezes prevail. The lowest recorded temperature (in January, 1905) is 51.5°. In the summer months temperatures as high as 92° have been recorded. Three severe hurricanes passed over the Bahamas in 1926, on 26th July, 17th September and 20th October, causing loss of life and great destruction to property and shipping.

The Colony was visited by two hurricanes in 1928, one in August, which only affected the Southern part of Andros, and the other in September, which severely affected New Providence, Bimini, Cat Island, Eleuthera and Harbour Island.

In 1929 the Colony experienced a hurricane of exceptional severity which lasted from 25th to 27th September, causing great destruction to property and shipping in New Providence and Andros.

Another hurricane, one of the severest ever experienced in the Colony, swept the Island of Abaco in September 1932, practically wiping out some of the settlements with an attendant loss of 14 lives and 70 injured.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race. About one-sixth are of European descent. English is universally spoken.

Trade and Industry.

The commercial relations of the Colony are mainly with the United States. Considerable quantities of pine-apples (canned), sponges, sisal and tomatoes are exported. In 1938 the principal exports were:—Sisal, 112 tons, valued at £1,275l.; sponge, 8,277 cwts., valued at £90,054l.; lumber 1,303,000 feet, value £8,934l.; shell, value £972l.; tomatoes 67,000 bushels, value £25,360l.; bark, value £1,507l.; salt, 133,000 bushels, value £1,706l.

The cultivation and preparation of the sisal fibre plant is an important industry. The estimated area planted at the end of 1938 was 3,204 acres.

Fishing is extensively carried on for the Nassau market, about 82 native-built boats, with 460 men, being employed. Turtle-shell, shells and pearls are largely exported. Sponge-fishing employs a large fleet. The approximate number of vessels engaged in the industry is 476—aggregate tonnage 4,515—with 2,760 open boats, and a large number of long shore open boats; men and boys employed, 4,500.

Nassau is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1938, 194 vessels of 6,279 tons.

Principal imports during 1938; foodstuffs, value £317,281l.; malt, value £10,869l.; spirits and wines, value £40,014l.; tobaccos, cigars and cigarettes, value £19,298l.

Lighthouses on several of the islands have been established, and are maintained by the Imperial Government. Several lights are also maintained by the local government.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States currency is also generally accepted in the Colony. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is a branch bank of the Royal Bank of Canada with deposits amounting to £1,886,659l. A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had, on 30th June, 1939, £80,320l. deposited.

Means of Communication.

There is a telephone service in New Providence, Eleuthera, Long Island and Cat Island.

An automatic telephone system of the latest type, with three exchanges, City, Western and Eastern, is now being installed in New Providence, together with a comprehensive system of underground cables.

There are no railways in the Colony and but few good roads except in New Providence and Eleuthera.

A direct passenger service between Liverpool and Nassau is maintained monthly by the ships of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company (14 days). Nassau may also be reached by Elders and Fyffes line from Avonmouth to Kingston, Jamaica (14 days) and by steamers of the Canadian National Steamship to Nassau (3 days). The quickest route is via New York, the journey from New York to Nassau taking only three days by the steamers of the Munson Line, which leave New York fortnightly. During the winter there is usually a weekly service provided by the Cunard White Star Line between New York and Nassau.

Besides this service there are frequent sailings from New York to Nassau by various steamships during the winter.

The cargo steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company sail for the Bahamas from London every three weeks.

There is also a regular contract Mail, Passenger and Freight Service during the winter months, from January to April, between Nassau and Miami, Florida. These vessels make two voyages a week in January and April, and three voyages a week in February and March. A weekly summer service is usually maintained between Nassau and Miami by a vessel under contract with the Government.

Besides this Service there are motor boats plying almost daily between the ports of Miami and Nassau. During the past year an air mail and passenger service has been operated by The Pan American Airways Inc., on a daily schedule in the winter months and three times a week in the summer months between Nassau and Miami.
Till February, 1892, the nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe was Key West, but in that month a cable from Nassau to Florida was completed. The cable is not however at present in working order and has been abandoned in favour of radio-telegraph communication, and twenty-four hour service with all parts of the world via Miami, Fla.

A twenty-four hour service is also maintained with the Kingston, Jamaica, wireless station of Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited, in addition to twenty-four hours service to ships at sea. Wireless stations provide in Interinsular telegraph service between Nassau (New Providence), Harbour Island, Governor's Harbour (Eleuthers) and Hatchet Bay (Eleuthers), Grand Bahama, Cornwall (Abaco), Hope Town (Abaco), and Marsh Harbour (Abaco), Inagua, Bimini and Long Island, Green Turtle Cay (Abaco), San Salvador or Watlings, The Bight (Cat Island), and Mangrove Cay (Andros), George Town (Exuma), Ragged Island and Spanish Wells, Cat Cay, Whale Cay (Berry Is.), and Mayaguana, Cherokee Sound (Abaco) and Long Cay. The Stations at Cat Cay and Whale Cay, Hatchet Bay and Inagua are also fitted with radio-telephone apparatus, and a radio-telephone service is maintained from Nassau, N.P., to U.S.A., Europe, Bermuda, Hawaiian Islands, South America, Canada, Japan, Philippine Islands, Cuba, Mexico, and ships at sea (direct or via Ocean Gate Radio).
