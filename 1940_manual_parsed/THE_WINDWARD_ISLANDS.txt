THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

Situation, Area and Trade.

The Windward Islands consist of the four islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Dominica, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically, Tobago from 1764 to 1783, and all three in 1838. The three first-named islands, and, as from 1st January, 1940, Dominica, which on that date was separated from the Leeward Islands, are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the four Colonies is 829 square miles, and their estimated population at the census of 1921, 199,313.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776, and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white and there are some Indian Coolies. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia and Dominica the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada where he is assisted by a Colonial Secretary. The Colonies of St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica are presided over by resident Administrators. When the Governor is absent from Grenada the Colonial Secretary becomes Administrator of that Colony. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. A Windward Islands Court of Appeal was set up in 1850 (13 & 14 Vict. c. 15) and abolished in 1920 by an Act (9 & 10 Geo. V. c. 47) which set up a Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the chief justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica. There is also a common audit system instituted in 1889.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada, which have branches in the larger islands, issue five-dollar notes. Currency notes of $1 and $2 denominations issued by the Government of Trinidad are
legal tender in the Windward Islands. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

Communications.

The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 16 days.

The steamers of Harrison Direct Line call at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Furness, Withy Line. The passenger and cargo steamers of the Canadian National Line call regularly at Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent, and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. Government-owned telephone systems exist throughout the islands. All four islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with the West Indies and Canada through the system of Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited, and thence with Great Britain and all parts of the world through the system of Cable and Wireless Limited. A coast station is also maintained at St. Lucia for communication with ships at sea.

A wireless installation has been erected at Carriacou by the local Government. It communicates with Grenada and through that island to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, &c., the ordinary tariff being 2d. per word more than from Grenada.

Grenada.

Situation, Area, &c.

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 8,467 acres, and a population (at 24th April, 1921) of 7,104.

General Description.

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and brushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic,
and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities; near the former there is a Govt. Rest House. The island is well equipped with roads. All the first-class roads and practically all the second and third-class roads are suitable for motor traffic. A bitumen-surfaced first-class road runs completely round the island and across it in two directions. A large proportion of the second-class roads are also surfaced treated and all roads leading to places of interest are all-weather roads. The total mileage of roads is 461. The island is divided into six districts or parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John—while the dependencies of Carriacou, Petit Martinique and other adjacent islets form a separate district, administered by a Commissioner. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping and had on 31st December, 1938, 145 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 2,637 tons; its fine harbour owing to its situation, healthiness, and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call for steamers. The town had a population of 4,629 by census of 24th April, 1921.

The other towns in the colony are Gouyave (or Charlotte Town), Victoria (or Grand Pauve), Sauteurs; Grenville (or La Baye); and Hillsborough, in Carriacou. English is universally spoken. French patois used to be spoken by the peasantry but the practice is declining rapidly. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the Negro race, except the East Indian population, which was 2,692 in number according to the census of 1921.

Climate.

The climate is good and during the months from December to the end of April, when the trade winds prevail, it is delightful. From July to October there is greater humidity and higher temperature with little variation between night and day. The climate may be regarded as hot during this period but it is not unhealthy at any time during the year. There is an appreciable variation of rainfall. In the mountainous centre it reached 187 inches in 1937 and in the lowlands to the south of the Islands it was as low as 61 inches. The rainfall was abnormally heavy during 1938. The falls recorded at the two stations mentioned were 246 and 74 inches respectively, while the fall at 28 stations showed an average of 140 inches, with a maximum of 249 inches and a minimum of 74 inches. The highest shade temperature recorded in 1938 was 89°0 and the lowest 70°0.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. The chief produce of Grenada is coco, of which a total value of 126,920£. was shipped in 1938. The modern sugar factory which was erected in 1936 in the southern part of the island manufactures sufficient sugar to meet local demands. No sugar is exported as yet. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such, for instance, as limes, coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, etc. Nutmeg cultivation occupies a prominent position. The value of spices exported in 1938 was 113,620£. Considerable attention is being given also to the production of the Gros Michel banana, of which the value of exports in 1938 amounted to 11,134£. In Carriacou cotton is the staple product; the value exported in 1938 was, with cotton seed, 3,864£. The cultivation of limes has now been successfully established in Carriacou, the exports of lime products in 1938 amounting to 10,297£. Tropical fruits of almost every description and of the finest quality are fairly plentiful, and are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, tanias, kushkush, pigeon-peas, plantains, bananas, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, etc. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The commercial value of the forests is now being explored. Rum is manufactured for local consumption, the total number of proof gallons in 1938 being 31,925.

The main imports are food-stuffs, textiles, timber for building purposes, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are turtles and turtle-shell, hides and skins, fruit and poultry.

The tariff of Import duties is partly on an ad valorem and partly on a specific basis. The rates in the case of the former are mainly 15% on Empire goods and 22½% on foreign goods. The preference on Empire goods is generally 33½%.

The percentages of Trade in 1938 were as follows:

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| United Kingdom | 42% | 40% |
| United States of America | 11 | 17 |
| Canada | 16 | 20 |
| Other British Possessions | 22 | 16 |
| Other Foreign Countries | 9 | 7 |

The total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou is 76,548; acreage of Carriacou, 8,447.

There is a government savings bank in St. George's, established in 1881, and extended to the out districts in 1889, and on 31st December, 1938, the amount at credit of depositors was 46,365£.

A co-operative bank was established in 1932, but there is no agricultural bank in the Colony.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. A settlement was attempted in 1609 by a company of London merchants, but the colonists were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French Company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.
In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; and in 1762 it was surrendered to the British under Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1795-6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated by the French Republic. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred by the rebels, and the colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercrombie suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established in regard to the African slaves, and this was followed in 1838 by their unconditional emancipation.

**Constitution.**

There was from 1766 a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 21 elected members.

Under an Act of 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the Legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was remodelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of £100 per year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict. c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and Crown Colony Government was established in December, 1877.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and on 1st June, 1885, Grenada became the headquarters of the Government, which includes the colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

Until the 1st of December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

By an Order in Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, seven ex officio members, three nominated unofficial members and five elected members. The Island was divided into five electoral districts, each returning one elected member.

By an Order in Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted; and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Treasurer), four nominated members and seven elected members (one for each of seven electoral districts). At the same time, the Governor is given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government.

The Government is assisted in the internal administration by six semi-elective District Boards.

**Education.**

There are 53 elementary schools, 11 Government and 42 aided. These schools are Senior, Combined, and Junior. Head teachers of senior and combined schools are paid from £60 to £200 per annum, according to their certificates of proficiency, and to the class of school. Bonuses are given them for extra duties. Grants are also given by Government in aid of buildings, furniture and apparatus. A Board of Education nominated by the Governor gives advice to Government in educational matters. In 1938 the average attendance was 9,296 children, the number on the rolls being 14,708. There is a Government secondary school for boys, and three for girls which receive grants-in-aid from the general revenue. The total expenditure incurred by Government on primary education for the year 1938 was £13,552.

ST. LUCIA.

Situation and Area.

The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus, during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 54' N. lat., and 60° 59' W. long.; at a distance of 24 miles to the south of Martinique, and 21 to the northeast of St. Vincent. It is 27 miles in length, and 14 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is 150 miles, and its area 233 sq. miles, rather less than Middlesex. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, and the surrounding district contain an estimated population of 21,124. Next in importance is the town of Soufrière, containing with the surrounding district an estimated population of 7,382.

History.

At the period of its discovery St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orléans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Islet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms on the 4th of April, 1794.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

General Description.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by internecine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect, and the population at 31st December, 1938, is estimated at 69,084. Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but English is gradually becoming more generally used. A very small percentage is of European descent, the remainder being of the negro race, or of East Indian origin. The reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is undeserved, the death rate for 1938 being 14·8 per 1,000. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation.

The danger from venomous reptiles is also much exaggerated. Owing to the introduction and spread of the mongoose, snakes are now but rarely met with. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are almost unknown. The...
temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday, in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera.

Castries, the chief town, has an excellent harbour. Dredging operations are carried out annually. There is a substantial concrete wharf, 650 feet in length, with a depth alongside of 27 feet at low water. There is another wharf, 540 feet in length, originally constructed in wood, which is gradually being reconstructed in concrete, and is kept dredged to a depth of 14 feet at low water. The facilities offered by the port as a port of call and coaling station are widely recognised. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1937, 18 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 597 tons.

A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and has now 1,051 depositors, with 27,476l. to their credit on 31st December, 1938. Branch savings banks exist at Soufrière and Vieux Fort, Dennery and Gros Islet.

**Constitution and Law.**

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy.

The Government is conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council.

By an Order in Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted, and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Administrator, Attorney-General, and Treasurer), three nominated members, and five elected members (one for each of three electoral districts and two members for a fourth district).

At the same time, the Governor was given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government. Other changes made were the fixing of a common age qualification, twenty-one years, for male and female voters, and a widening of the qualifications of electors.

Law is administered by a Chief-Justice-Magistrate from whom as Chief Justice in civil cases there is an appeal to the West Indian Court of Appeal and as Magistrate an appeal to the Commissioner of Appeals. There is one other Magistrate whose decisions are liable to review by the Chief Justice. In criminal cases tried by the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of nine, except in trials for capital offences, when the jury consists of twelve persons as in England.

A code of civil law, the authors of which were Sir G. W. Des Vœux, G.C.M.G., and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., became law in October, 1879. This code was framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances. The Statute Law of the Colony was consolidated to 1916 by Mr. F. H. Coller, Chief Justice, who also edited the Commercial Code, 1916.

The revising and editing of the Criminal Law and Procedure of the Colony by Mr. J. E. M. Salmon was completed during 1920 and proclaimed as the Criminal Code, 1920. It came into force on the 1st January, 1921.

**Education.**

On the 30th June, 1891, the trustees of the Lady Mico charity closed the eleven schools which they had till then maintained, and withdrew their connection with the Colony. Three of these schools became Government schools, and the others assisted schools under the new Education Ordinance. In 1898 all the Government schools were handed over to the Roman Catholic body, and became assisted schools. There were, on the 31st December, 1938, 45 assisted schools. Of these, 3 were Anglican, 3 Methodist and 39 Roman Catholic. The number of children on the rolls was 10,210, with an average attendance of 7,158, and the amount spent by the Government on primary education was 5,779l. The Government grants 450l. a year to a Roman Catholic second-grade school for boys, St. Mary’s College; while the Sisters of St. Joseph conduct a similar school for Girls. A Government grant of 175l. is made to the latter school annually.

As a result of the Mayhew-Marriott Commission of 1932, a Board of Education was constituted on 21st March, 1936, whose chief functions are of an advisory nature.

**Industry, Trade and Customs.**

Limes and lime products, sugar, rum, cocoa, coconuts, bananas, bay oil, bay rum, spices, and Sea Island cotton are produced. There are four sugar factories, 16 lime factories (for the production of lime oils and juices), three rum distilleries, and one bay oil distillery. While all industries show expansion, depending on market conditions, the banana industry has experienced the most rapid and satisfactory rise, shipments in 1938 totalling 100,726 stems, valued at 10,078l.

A fair amount of land in certain districts is in the possession of the Crown, and, under certain conditions, is available for sale for development purposes; the soil will grow any kind of tropical fruit trees or economic plants. Attention is now being paid to the establishment of Land Settlement Schemes with a view to utilising the latent resources of the Colony.

The Customs Import Tariff is mainly on a specific duty basis, with a preference in favour of Empire products which in most cases amounts to one third of the general tariff rate.

The percentage of the Colony’s Import Trade with the United Kingdom, other parts of the British Empire, and the principal foreign countries during 1938 was as follows:

- United Kingdom ... 37-62 per cent.
- Other parts of the British Empire ... 31-36 ,, ,
- United States of America ... 18-83 ,, ,
- Other Foreign countries ... 12-19 ,, ,

The percentage of the Colony’s Export Trade with the United Kingdom, &c., during 1938 was as follows:

- United Kingdom ... 29-79 per cent.
- Canada ... 48-80 ,, ,
- Rest of British Empire ... 15-53 ,, ,
- United States of America ... 5-05 ,, ,
- Other Foreign countries ... 0-83 ,, ,

Situation and Area.
The Island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 96,000 acres of land, about half the area of Middlesex. Most of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from Kingstown.

General Description.
Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contained at the census of 1931, a population of 4,269 souls. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1938 27 sailing vessels of a net tonnage of 747 tons and 3 motor vessels of 67 tons net.

There are five other small towns in the island, the most important being Georgetown on the north-east, and Barrouallie on the west.

The most striking natural feature of the island is its "Soufrière," or volcano, situated at the northern extremity of the island, and rising to about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea. After a violent eruption in 1812, it remained dormant for a period of ninety years, and then broke into violent eruption again on May 7th, 1902, when the entire northern half of the island was devastated, and nearly 2,000 lives were lost. The eruption synchronised with that of Mont Pelée in Martinique which destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The "Soufrière" remained intermittently active throughout 1902, and there was a further eruption in March, 1903, since when it has remained quiescent.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded and almost impassable mountains traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north-east of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. This district formerly comprised the most fertile sugar estates. The next highest point after
the "Soufrière" in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are numerous but small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond River.

In September, 1898, the island was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution. In September, 1921, the island was again struck by a hurricane which, although not as violent as its predecessor, did considerable damage to property and crops, entailing considerable hardship on the populace and necessitating the expenditure by Government of £3,288l. on relief measures.

Climate.

In the dry season, January to May, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy. The nights are cool all the year round. The rainfall during 1938 was 104.49 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during the same year was 89° F., the lowest 67° F., the mean monthly temperature being 79-9° F. in the shade. The prevailing wind is S.E.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

Sugar, syrup, rum, cocoa, coconuts, copra, bananas, and excellent arrowroot are produced. Arrowroot, the most important product, is graded and exported under the control of a Co-operative Arrowroot Association. The fine quality of the coconuts has resulted in a good demand for St. Vincent whole nuts on the Canadian and U.S.A. markets and a considerable export trade in this commodity has been established in recent years. A Banana Association exists for developing the industry, and marketing the fruit on a co-operative basis. The cultivation of ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention. Sea Island cotton, the best in the Empire, is extensively planted, for the ginning of which a Government Ginnery has been erected. There are also three privately owned ginneries. Many of the sugar and arrowroot mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivable land is owned by a few individuals; portions of Crown lands have been alienated to peasant proprietors, and several estates have been purchased by the Government with the aid of an Imperial grant and allotted to the same class of settlers. The forests have mostly been exploited except where they are inaccessible and contain very few valuable timber trees. There are 65 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne. There are also some 300 miles of byway connecting with the highway.

The port of Kingstown is visited weekly by steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, fortnightly by Steamers of the Ocean Dominion Steamship Corporation and Furness Withy Lines and occasionally by steamers of the Harrison and American Caribbean.

A telephone system has been established, having 1 central and 3 branch exchanges, with 270 connections and some 446 miles of line.

The import duties are largely ad valorem, mostly 18½ per cent.; but there are many specific duties. Preferential rates, mostly two-thirds of the general rate, are charged on imports from other British countries.

Export duties are levied on cotton, arrowroot, cassava, starch, cocoa, copra, sugar, syrup, molasses, rum and coconuts.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £63,629.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but in 1795 the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra," sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British headquarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the
Island of Roatan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the negro slaves. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first East Indian Coolie labourers in 1861. Most of them returned to India, but some made their home in the Colony.

**Constitution.**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony, and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex-officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. (The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.)

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 & 40 Vict. c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. Until 1st December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of official and unofficial members nominated and appointed by the Crown.

By an Order in Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, four ex-officio members, one nominated unofficial member and three elected members. By the Saint Vincent (Legislative Council) Amendment Order in Council, 1931, the Legislative Council was constituted of the Governor, of three ex-officio members, of one nominated official member, of one nominated unofficial member, and of three elected members. The Island was divided into three electoral districts each returning one elected member.

By an Order in Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted, and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Administrator, Attorney-General, and Treasurer), three nominated members, and five elected members (one for each of five electoral districts).

At the same time, the Governor was given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation, which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is the sole Judge of this court.

**Education.**

There were, on 31st December, 1938, 37 primary schools, with 10,453 children on the rolls. The average attendance during 1938 was 6,108. There is also a government secondary school for boys, and a high school for girls.

An Island Scholarship is awarded triennially tenable for from three to five years at an approved University. Annual value £20l. and cost of passage. An Agricultural Scholarship tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture is awarded triennially. Annual value £60l.

The Government expenditure on primary education in 1938 was £9,566l.

**Savings Bank.**

A savings bank was established in 1866, and had 941 depositors, with 18,503l. deposited, on 31st December, 1938. Branches of the bank have been opened at Georgetown, Barrouallie, and Union Island.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 158° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 3043 square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque, rising at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin to 4,747 feet. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subject to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of 312,092l. 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed a unit of a General Government, which comprised Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, a Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval expedition against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of it on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was appointed Governor. Trade failed, and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican leader, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now referred to in the island for marking the time of events, by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Rupert's near the town of Portsmouth.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H. L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of 15,000l. by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the Island. Owing to the economic depression of the Island, which started from about 1928, and the reduction of the Imports and Exports, it has been necessary to appeal to the Imperial Government for several Grants and Loans-in-Aid. These have assisted conditions greatly and as a result there are already signs that the productivity of the Island is on the increase.

On the 1st of January, 1940, Dominica was separated from the Colony of the Leeward Islands and grouped with the Windward Islands.

Considerable areas in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marsunding of the

from about 1928, and the reduction of the Imports and Exports, it has been necessary to appeal to the Imperial Government for several Grants and Loans-in-Aid. These have assisted conditions greatly and as a result there are already signs that the productivity of the Island is on the increase.

On the 1st of January, 1940, Dominica was separated from the Colony of the Leeward Islands and grouped with the Windward Islands.

Considerable areas in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the
Maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is good and the climate healthy. Limes and cocoas flourish throughout the coastal zone. The former were almost wiped out by root disease a few years ago, but trees budded on resistant stocks have since been extensively planted, and exports of lime products are now increasing. The higher slopes in the centre of the island are well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, oranges, nutmegs, spices and such tropical fruits as require humid conditions.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geysir or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, volcanic ash covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers, with fish in some, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Lime juice, cocoa, coconuts, copra, rum, tobacco, and fruit (including green limes, grape fruit, oranges, mangoes, bananas and avocado pears), are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, has now ceased to be made. Trade is carried on also in spices, oils, and timber. 1938: cocoa, 3,292l.; essential oils, 16,385l.; limes, 5,288l.; cocon. lime juice, 4l.; raw lime juice, 6,145l.; rum, 697l.; tobacco and cigars, 1,048l.; coconuts, 3,358l.; bananas, 8,115l.; grape fruit, 1,894l.; oranges, 5,340l.; mangoes, 2,366l.; Avocado pears, 1,320l.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1938 was 107-63 inches; the average for the whole island was 146-63 inches; the mean temperature 79° Fahr. (Roseau).

The chief town is Roseau, with a population of 6,803 according to the census of April, 1921: it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1938, 10 vessels, of a total tonnage of 235 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north-west of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) at Roseau, and one of the Royal Bank of Canada, established in April, 1915.

There is a Government telephone system of 585 miles, with 5 exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

There are 46 miles of tarmet, 30 miles of water-bound macadam, 26 miles improved earth and gravel and 254 miles of unimproved earth and non-surfaced roads in the Presidency.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. A Legislative council was created, consisting of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. Ordinance No. 21 of 1924 provided for the election of four of the unofficial members of the Council with the Administrator presiding in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency. As a result of the Report of the Closer Union Commission which visited Dominica, among other West Indian Islands, in 1932, the Secretary of State approved of a further change in the Constitution of the Island to provide for the creation of a new Legislative Council with an unofficial majority subject to certain safeguards being left in the hands of the Governor. This change was effected under Ordinance No. 8 of 1936, which was brought into force by proclamation on the 15th December, 1936, and provides for a Legislative Council consisting of the Administrator as President, with a casting vote only, two official Members, three nominated Members and five elected Members. The first meeting of Council under the new Constitution was held on the 10th May, 1937.

A considerable number of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is becoming general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the Island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1298, 1902).

According to the Census of 1921 there are about 420 Caribs in the Island, of whom about 141 are estimated as of pure blood.

Customs Tariff.

The rates of duty under the Customs Tariff are mainly specific. A preferential reduction varying in amount, but in most cases amounting to one-third of the general rate is accorded to Empire products.

The ad valorem duty on most articles is 10% and 20%. Perfumery, Jewellery and Plate and Plated Ware 20% and 30%.
