BARBADOS.*

Situation and Area.

Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most easterly of the Caribbee Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, somewhat larger than the Isle of Wight.

History.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who found it uninhabited and rude in appearance, and named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig-trees. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship Olive Blossom in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1626 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I., fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed in February, 1637, on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Desane their Governor. In 1637 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I. of all the Caribbee Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300L. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as Governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The Leeward and Windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

General Description.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, in latitude 13° 6' North, and longitude 59° 37' West. This town contains, according to the census of 1921, 13,486 inhabitants. Speightstown, the only other town, has about 1,500 inhabitants.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead which is available for all classes of vessels and is well sheltered from the prevailing trade winds. The roadstead is open to winds from the S.S.W. through West to N.N.W., but these are of rare occurrence. There is an inner harbour or careenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. It is a port of registry, and had registered, on 31st December, 1936, 67 vessels, of a total net tonnage of 6,891 tons.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as off the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation.

The area of the island called the Scotland district, which is the part enclosed by a semi-circular sweep of the ridge in the north-east, is composed of sandstones, clays, and infusorial earths.

Traces of oil were discovered in certain districts and experimental borings were carried out by the British Union Oil Company, Ltd., but the flow of oil was inadequate and operations on a large scale have ceased.

The Company has also established an oil depot and bunkering station for ships in Carlisle Bay.

A water supply is provided for all the parishes of the island by the Colonial Government, which bought up and extended the water works formerly operated by two companies, the Bridgetown Water Works Company and the Barbados Water Supply Company.

Owing to the steady Easterly Trade winds, which blow almost continuously from December to June, the climate is bracing and the heat is never oppressive. During the remainder of the year, the wet season of the Island, the heat is seldom excessive, although the absence of the Trade Winds renders the climate less invigorating. The average temperature is 79°-F, and rainfall 61 inches.

The Island is largely visited as a Health resort by residents of neighbouring West Indian Colonies and British Guiana. It is, to a considerable extent, also utilised as a winter resort by visitors from temperate climates and a port of call for tourist steamers.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. The produce exported during the last three years has been as follows:

| Year | Sugar Tons | Melasses Gallons |
|------|------------|------------------|
| 1936 | 97,811     | ...10,592,694    |
| 1937 | 100,806    | ...10,677,390    |
| 1938 | 80,912     | ...8,669,054     |

The area under sugar cultivation in 1938 was 41,532 acres. In September, 1898, the island, in common with St. Lucia and St. Vincent, suffered severely from the effects of a disastrous hurricane.
In 1902-3 there was an epidemic of small-pox, which caused a prolonged quarantine and seriously affected trade. Cotton-growing was revived with help from the Colonial Treasury and the British Cotton Growing Association, but owing to market and other conditions almost entirely ceased. In 1938 the amount of cotton exported was 4,049 lbs., valued at £231. Efforts to revive the industry have been partially successful.

The distribution of the Colony's import trade in 1938 was:

| %     | Value   |
|-------|---------|
| United Kingdom | 40.7% | £843,085 |
| Canada       | 13.1% | 271,968 |
| Other parts of the British Empire | 17.6% | 363,897 |
| United States of America | 11.8% | 243,731 |
| Other Foreign Countries | 16.8% | 347,763 |

The Imports are classified as follows:

- Food, drink, etc.: £740,114
- Raw materials: 163,186
- Manufactured articles: 1,100,380
- Animals not for Food: 5,708
- Miscellaneous: 77,513

Total: £2,086,901

The Customs Tariff of the Colony is the result of the Canada West Indies Reciprocal (Tariff) Agreement Act, 1926, which provides that the duties on all goods the produce or manufacture of Canada shall not be more than 50 per cent of the duties on similar goods imported from Foreign countries. Exceptions to this provision are Tobacco, Cigars and Cigarettes while specific preferences are provided for on a list of Articles named in Schedule B of the Act.

These preferences were by the Customs Tariff Act, 1921, extended to goods the produce or manufacture of all parts of the British Empire.

Twenty-five per cent., 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of British factory cost of articles, partly of foreign origin, entitles these goods to be admitted under the British Preferential Tariff, except piece goods containing 50 per cent. or more by weight of cotton or of artificial silk or of cotton and artificial silk combined imported from the United Kingdom, which may not be admitted under the British Preferential Tariff unless they have been spun, woven and finished in the British Empire. Under the Quotas Act, 1934, all importations of this class of piece goods from any foreign country are restricted.

As a result of the Conference held at Ottawa in 1932 further preferences were granted to Empire goods and given effect to by the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Act 1932 No. 2.

About two-thirds of the duties are on a specific and the remainder on an ad valorem basis.

Population.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939. By the census of 1891 the population was returned at 182,306. By the census of April, 1921, the population was 156,312, the decrease, as compared with the figures for 1891, being attributed to the large numbers of the labouring classes which have from time to time emigrated to Panama in connection with the Canal Works, while many others have gone to Para, Brazil, Cuba, the United States of America and Canada in search of more remunerative employment than what can be obtained locally. The estimated population at the end of 1938 was 193,082. English is universally spoken. Labour is cheap, and the soil is well cultivated, the island having the appearance of a well-kept garden.

* Includes £16,457 Bullion and Coin.

Currency and Banking.

Government accounts are kept in sterling; commercial accounts in dollars. British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, and there is no gold in circulation. Government currency notes in the denominations of $1-00 and $2-00 were issued in April, 1938. These notes are legal tender in any amount. There are three banks doing business in Barbados, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), capital paid up 4,975,500L sterling, and the Royal Bank of Canada, with a paid up capital of 7,291,666L, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce with a paid up capital of 6,250,000L. There is a Government savings bank, which had, on 31st December, 1938, 17,051 depositors. The total amount at credit of depositors on 31st December, 1938, was 873,754L.

Internal Communication.

An elaborate road system exists throughout the Island, 532½ miles of road being suitable for use by motor vehicles. Road transport by public service vehicle is subject to the control of the Transport Board, a statutory body.

The Barbados Telephones Co., Limited, a private company, at the 31st July, 1939, maintains a total of 2,150 Exchange lines and 2,686 Stations, with a wire mileage of approximately 9,000. The latest type of Strowger automatic equipment came into service in the two main exchanges during the autumn of 1937.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act No. 41 of the 9th December, 1878, which authorised a total expenditure not exceeding 15,000l. annually on all grades of education. This section of the Act of 1878 was repealed, and Section 9 (d) of the Education (Amendment) Act, 1897, authorised an annual expenditure of a sum not exceeding 11,000l. on elementary education. This section has now been repealed by the Education (Amendment) Act, 1910, which authorised the amount to be spent on elementary education at 14,200l. In 1939 the sum of 55,800l. was voted by the Legislature for Elementary Education, and the total vote for all grades of education amounted to 71,676l.

The central administration is vested in a Board appointed by the Governor, and the local control of elementary schools is in the hands of the clergymen of the various districts assisted by committees of management. There are 126 elementary schools with 20,204 scholars (average attendance), and 27,168 on the rolls. At these elementary schools free education is now provided. Secondary schools are managed by Governing Bodies working under schemes formulated by the central Board of Education and approved by the Legislature. Government has undertaken to provide milk and biscuits to elementary school children. Provision has also been made for free medical and dental treatment of elementary school children and for fitting of glasses for correction of visual defects.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Sir Christopher Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.C., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30l. per annum from the College funds, and six Island Scholarships at 40l. per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are competitive, and are confined to natives or sons of natives, or of persons domiciled in the island who have resided therein for at least ten years.

There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation, which has been liberally supported by...
the Legislature. It has a staff of twelve university men as Masters, two Preparatory Mistresses, three Lecturers in Natural and Agricultural Sciences and two additional masters in the Lower Forms. The number of pupils at the close of 1938 was 268. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish, to the N.E. of the island, was re-opened in 1882, after having been closed for several years. The number of pupils at the close of 1938 was 151. The Barbados English Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, are tenable at any College in the British Empire approved by the Board, for a period of four years.

The number of years for which these scholarships are tenable may be varied to five or six, but the total value of each scholarship cannot be more than £1,050, with an additional £50 to defray initial expenses.

A first-grade school for girls was opened in 1883, called The Queen's College. It has a staff of twelve teachers. The number of pupils at the close of 1938 was 186.

There are five second-grade schools for boys and three for girls. These first and second-grade schools cost the Government, including grants for scholarships, £11,350 during 1938. They also receive annual grants for scholarships from the Vestries of the various parishes in which they are situated.

Police, &c.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1835 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1867) were combined with the Land Police. A Juvenile Reformatory for boys was opened in April, 1883, and one for girls in April, 1911.

There is a lunatic asylum, a lazaretto and a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the latter of which the Colony contributed £28,186 in 1937-38.

Constitution.

The Colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the appointment and control of public officers, except the Treasurer, who is an officer of the House of Assembly. The Legislature consists of a Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of nine members appointed by the King, and a House of Assembly, having twenty-four members elected for a period of two years on the basis of a moderate franchise. The qualifications of members and electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, which became law in April, 1884, and which repeals all previous legislation on the subject. By this Act an extension of the franchise was granted, and 2,004 electors were registered under its provisions, the number previous to its enactment being only 1,641. This and other Acts relating to the franchise was consolidated by the Representation of the People Act, 1901. The only change made was the extension of the franchise to persons enjoying a pension of £50 a year or more. The number of registered electors for the year 1938 was 6,381. The executive part of the Government is vested in the Executive Council appointed by the Crown and consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General ex officio, Sir F. J. Clarke, K.C.M.G., V.D., and the Hon. S. C. Thorne, M.L.C., and such other persons as may be nominated by the King, and the Executive Committee consists of the members of the Executive Council ex officio, one member from the Legislative Council, and four members of the House of Assembly nominated annually by the Governor. This body introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates, and initiates all Government measures. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Tobago, but in 1885, by Royal Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands and made a distinct Government.

Local Government.

The island is divided into eleven parishes, each of which has its local affairs administered by a Vestry which is elected annually, the Rector of the Parish being the Chairman. The functions of the Vestry include sanitation and the care of the sick and poor. The upkeep of roads in eight of the eleven parishes is carried out by Highway Commissioners appointed by each Vestry, for the other three parishes the Central Road Board is responsible. The Vestries levy rates on lands and houses, and taxes on trade. The revenue for the upkeep of roads is provided principally by taxes on land, houses, trade, vehicles, draft animals, etc., under the provisions of the Highways Act, supplemented by grants from the Government.

The total revenue collected by the Vestries in 1938-39 amounted to £99,770, not including temporary loans, repaid during the year.

General Description.

The Bermudas, of which a good account will be found in the narrative of the voyage of the Challenger, may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sandhills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 3 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width, and generally considerably less.

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern, and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral. The largest island, generally known as The Main Island, is about 14 miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands taken together measure about 3,000 acres. The city of Hamilton, now the seat of Government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms a safe and convenient harbour for the vessels which carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the Colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the transfer of the seat of Government to Hamilton, is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as a harbour of refuge.

The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island, entirely given up for the accommodation of His Majesty's Dockyard and a number of other naval establishments; Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, and now exclusively occupied by military depots and garrisons; Somerset, Smith's, St. David's, Cooper's, Nonsuch, Darrell's, Ports, and Godets—all inhabited by a civil population. The islands form an almost continuous chain, and there is uninterrupted communication by roads and bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset, and over Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island—a distance of about 22 miles.

About one-half of the inhabitants are of English descent, the remainder belonging for the most part to the negro race. English is universally spoken.

The climate has been long celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The rainfall in 1938 was 57.96 inches, as against an average of 57.94 inches. In winter the thermometer never falls below 40° Fahr., and the summers are never very hot, the thermometer rarely rising above 86°. The summer heat, too, is generally tempered by a pleasant sea breeze. Mean relative humidity in 1938 was 78.

In 1914 the Legislature voted the sum of £51,750, payable in fifteen yearly instalments, as a contribution to the Imperial Treasury in aid of the war fund.

The state of the Colony's finances did not admit of an immediate cash contribution and these annual payments represent a lump sum of the present value of £40,000.

In 1927 the Legislature voted a contribution to His Majesty's Government of 2/6 per capita of
the local population, payable after the 1st January, 1930, towards the cost of the military Garrison in the Colony, and a further contribution payable after the 1st January, 1928, of a sum computed in respect of all ranks of the Military Garrison serving in the Colony.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

In former days the inhabitants of Bermuda gave themselves up almost entirely to maritime pursuits. Numerous small vessels, of from 200 to 300 tons burthen, built by the islanders themselves, of their native cedar, traded between the West Indies and Demerara, and the United States, and the British colonies of North America. Later they extended their voyages, carrying the salt fish of Newfoundland to Italy and Portugal, and taking back the Port wine for which Newfoundland became celebrated, or running down to Madeira or Ascension to meet the homeward-bound Indian fleet, and taking back cargoes of tea or other Indian and Chinese products to be distributed along the American seaboard.

The repeal of the British navigation laws, the introduction of steam, and the very general substitution of iron for wooden ships, gradually destroyed the carrying trade which had been so profitable to Bermuda, and now the maritime fleet may be said to have ceased to exist, and the industry of the islanders is entirely confined to mercantile pursuits and to turning to account the small quantity of agricultural land which they possess.

The soil of Bermuda is naturally calcareous, free-draining, and poor in humus. A fair state of fertility is, however, readily maintained by the regular use of manures and fertilisers. Not more than one-fourth of the total area of the colony can be cultivated, but the climate, combined with the geographical position of these islands, compensates for the small extent of arable land. There is never any danger of frost, and seeds may be sown and plants put out at any time. The main crops, potatoes, onions and green vegetables, are planted from August to March, and are reaped and shipped from December to June when the Canadian markets are comparatively bare of early potatoes and fresh vegetables.

Practically the whole of the exports go to Canada. About two-fifths of the imports come from the United Kingdom, two-fifths from foreign countries and the remainder from the Dominions and Colonies.

The Islands of Bermuda have become a favourite resort for Americans and Canadians. Large hotels have sprung up, and a considerable amount of money is expended by the visitors.

The total number of tourists to Bermuda during 1938 was 82,062, of whom 78,898 came from U.S.A., 833 from Canada, 1,133 from United Kingdom.

The quantity of shipping is remarkable for so small a place. During 1938, as will be seen from the tables, 6,441,284 tonnage entered and cleared, of which 5,297,210 was British.

About two-thirds of the Government revenue is obtained from Customs Duties on imports. The greater part of these receipts is from ad valorem duties at the rate of 10 per cent., with a surtax of 25 per cent. of the duty on all goods of non-British origin. Wines, spirits, and tobacco of British origin are subject to a 2½ per cent. surtax, and additional preferences have recently been granted as the result of the agreements concluded at Ottawa.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £1, 10s. and 5s. Currency Notes of value of 200,943l. 10s. were in circulation on 31st December, 1938. There are two incorporated banks, the Bank of Bermuda, Limited, and the Bank of N. T. Nutterfield & Son, Limited, and several of the leading merchants do a considerable amount of business as private bankers and agents. A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and there are branches at Hamilton, St. George's, and Sandy's Parish. The number of depositors at the end of 1938 was 5,876, the total amount of deposits 108,866l.

On the 1st of January, 1922, the Savings Bank was transferred from the Treasury to the Post Office Department.

Education.

In 1839 the Colonial Legislature first granted a sum of money to aid elementary schools.

The central control is vested in a Board of Education, consisting of ten members appointed by the Governor under the provisions of the Schools Act, 1922.

All the schools are private schools, charging fees. Attendance is compulsory, and there were, in 1938, 30 aided schools with 4,907 scholars.

There are, in addition, about 17 schools which receive no State aid.

In August, 1905, the Legislature established an annual scholarship of 150l., tenable by youths, natives of Bermuda, for two years at some educational institution abroad to be approved by the Governor, with a view to assisting youths to prepare to compete for the Rhodes' Scholarship awarded to Bermuda. The amount was increased to 200l. p.a. in 1920, and the tenure of the scholarship to three years in 1927.

At the end of the year 1924, the Bermuda (Technical Education) Scholarship Act was passed establishing four new scholarships each of the value of 125l., subsequently increased to 150l., and tenable for four years at some educational institution out of the Colony.

Means of Communication.

Telegraphic communication is conducted by Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited over its cable to Halifax, Nova Scotia, whence the system of Cable and Wireless Limited communicates via Great Britain with all parts of the world. Another cable connects with Turks Island and thence with Jamaica and the West Indies.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited owns a coast and Aeradio station for communication with ships and aircraft and operates a Direction-Finding service providing bearings with ships and aircraft.

Communication between Bermuda and England is maintained by steamers of the Pacifico Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., which make regular calls at Bermuda every month outward and homeward, Bermuda being a port of call in both directions.

Permits to land in Bermuda are required by other than bona fide visitors with first class return tickets.

Communication between Bermuda and New York was maintained prior to outbreak of war by steamers of the Furness-Bermuda Line, with bi-weekly sailings. These steamers have now been withdrawn and the Bermuda Government is negotiating with the United States Lines for a weekly service between Bermuda and New York.
The Canadian National Steamships maintain a passenger and freight service between Montreal, Bermuda, Nassau, Kingston, Belize and British Honduras, sailing every two weeks from Montreal in summer and from Halifax in winter, and also a fortnightly passenger and freight service between Halifax, Boston, Bermuda, St. Kitts-Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, Trinidad and British Guiana.

Letters from England usually take from nine to twelve days. Postage rates are:

| Letters. | Newspapers. |
|----------|------------|
| Within the Colony, per 1 oz. 1d. | ½d. per 2 oz. |
| To U.K., India and British Colonies, per 1 oz. 1½d. | Books per 2 oz. |
| To all other countries | 2½d. per 2 oz. |
| Parcels to England, 1s. 6d. for 3 lbs.; 3s. for 7 lbs.; 4s. 3d. for 11 lbs.; 6s. 9d. for 22 lbs. |

Internal Communications.

A light railway is in operation between St. Georges and Somerset. There are approximately 105 miles of colonial and 15 miles of military roads. There is a private telephone company, which has 2,257 subscribers and about 11,800 miles of wire, a large portion of which is in underground cables.

Government and Constitution.

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled in 1684, and since then the Governors have always been appointed by the Crown, and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council, and the House of Assembly. The session lasts usually from November to June.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, consisting of four official and three unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 2,717 electors, the electoral qualifications being the possession of freehold property of not less than 60l. value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property rated at 240l. The members of Executive Council and of the Legislature are paid 8s. a day for each day's attendance.

Local Government.

Hamilton and St. George have been incorporated since 1793 and 1797 respectively, and there are nine parish vestries, all the members of which, as well as of the two municipal corporations, are elected annually.
