Education.

Education is in charge of a Board of Education which receives an annual grant from the public revenue. Thirteen public elementary schools are maintained, with a roll of 804 pupils and an average attendance of 670.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 24) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica and these, with 27 elected members, known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly under the presidency of the Commissioner. Elections are held biennially.

The present constitution of this Assembly of Justices and Vestry is 100 years old and the centenary was commemorated by a special issue of postage stamps in 1932.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is about 166 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 6½ miles long and 1½ miles broad. According to the census of 1921 Grand Turk contains 1,568 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population which in 1921 was 5,612. The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

These Islands were discovered in 1512 by Ponce de Leon, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas. In 1873 they were annexed to Jamaica and still remain one of its dependencies.

Two hurricanes passed over these Islands in 1926, on July 24th and September 16th respectively, and did great damage. The second one was the most disastrous, as regards damage to property, in the history of the Dependency.

Another hurricane passed over these Islands on September 14th, 1928, which did considerable damage and caused the loss of 17 lives.
Industries, Trade and Customs.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance. 980,445 bushels were exported in 1938 valued at £18,451. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1938, 17,494 lbs., was valued at £2,251. 599,451 dried conchs (shell fish), valued at £584.

A lobster canning plant is established at the Caicos Islands. 808 cases of lobster, valued at £1,392, were exported during 1938.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1938, 176 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 13,678 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

The bulk of the imports (16,208) in 1938 out of a total of 25,974, are from the U.S. of America. The exports are chiefly to Canada and the United States.

An ad valorem customs duty of 15% is levied on most imports and specific duties on alcoholic liquors, tobacco, flour and a few other articles.

The British preferential tariff is 10%.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.
