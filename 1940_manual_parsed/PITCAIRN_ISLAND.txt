PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' W. long.). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. Bounty, with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence
until the island was visited in 1806. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population (at 30th June, 1936) numbers 202 persons.

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, A. H. Young.

The Government is now administered under the High Commissioner, by a Council consisting of a Chief Magistrate, two Assessors, a Secretary and a Chairman of the Internal Committee. These officers are elected annually by the people.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.
