SARAWAK.

General.

In 1864 Great Britain recognized Sarawak as an independent State. An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 442,900 composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 450 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kedurong Point. In 1892 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kedurong Point and the Baran River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1894 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1906. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Heir presumptive, Bertram Brooke (H.H. the Tuan Muda), born 8th August, 1876.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33' 10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses hospitals and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 480 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under four resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

The S.P.G., and Roman Catholic Missions have stations at various other places all over the country.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 137,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Mukah, a large town on the Mukah River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bau, Serian, Sadong, Lundu, Simanggang, Betong, Saratok, Engkili, Sarikei, Binatang, Matu, Kapit, Oya, Rejang, Miri, Baram, Bintulu, Limbang, Lawas, Kanowit, Matu.

Communications.

Vessels of the Sarawak Steamship Company Limited and Straits Steamship Company Limited provide a service every week between Kuching and Singapore. A service between Sibu and Singapore is maintained by the Sarawak Steamship Company Limited, which also provide a coasting service.

There are roads around the capital and thence to Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles) and to Sadong (about 40 miles). Internal communication is almost entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.

Posts and Telegraphs.

Sarawak joined the Postal Union in 1897.

Local.—To any place in the country, 5 cents per 2 oz., and 5 cents to Singapore. Inland postcards 2 cents.

Sources of Revenue.

The principal sources of revenue are the Monopolies, Customs, and Mineral Royalties.

The Customs Tariff covers a wide range of imports and exports. Import duties are levied on an ad valorem basis at the Sarawak port of entry. Goods produced or manufactured within the British Empire are admitted at preferential rates. Detailed information can be obtained at the Sarawak Govt. Offices, Millbank House, London, S.W.1.

Harbour, buoy, and light dues.—Five cents per ton, payable on arrival, and chargeable to all vessels of five tons and upwards.
