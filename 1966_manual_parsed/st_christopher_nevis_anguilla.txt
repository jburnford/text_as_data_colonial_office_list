Area and Geographical Features

The total area of the Colony is 138 square miles (St. Kitts 65, Nevis 36, Anguilla 35 and Sombrero 2 square miles). St. Kitts has a range of lofty mountains traversing its central part (Mount Misery 3,711 feet). Nevis is nearly circular in shape with a central mountain rising to 3,596 feet. Both islands are of volcanic origin. Anguilla is flat and composed of oligocene limestone and clay. Sombrero is a rocky islet. Hot mineral springs with valuable medicinal properties are to be found near Charlestown, Nevis.

Population

The figure for the population at the 1960 Census was 56,591.

Principal Towns

Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts, has a population of 15,726, and Charlestown and its environs, the capital of Nevis, has a population of approximately 2,850.

History

St. Christopher, discovered by Columbus on his second voyage in 1493, was the first island in the West Indies to be colonized by the English, when Sir Thomas Warner took settlers there in 1623. In 1624 the French, under d'Esnambuc, also colonized one-half of the island.

After a severe battle with the Europeans in about 1626, the Caribs, the native people of the island, were driven out in 1629.

Intermittent warfare between the French and British settlers during the seventeenth century ravaged the economy of the island. It was, however, ceded to Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The last fighting on the island took place in 1782 when the French captured Brimstone Hill after a memorable siege and once more took possession of St. Christopher. The island was finally restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

Nevis, also sighted by Columbus on his second voyage, was settled by the English in 1628 and soon became one of the most prosperous of the Antilles. Although it suffered from French and Spanish attacks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it maintained a sound economic position until the middle of the nineteenth century.

Columbus probably also first sighted Anguilla. The island remained continuously British after its colonization in 1650 but was subject in its early days to severe depredations by marauders, free-booters and pirates.
