SEYCHELLES

Area

Its land area is approximately 89 square miles. Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad and is estimated to cover 54 square miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Felicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf and Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes (excluding Desroches Island (see under British Indian Ocean Territory page 97)), Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island and Coëtivy are also dependencies of Seychelles.
Population

The population at mid-year 1964 was estimated to be 46,472.

Principal Town

Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of about 11,000.

Geographical Features

The Colony's 89 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over seventeen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate

In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. The average annual rainfall in Victoria for the past 58 years is 91-38 inches and the mean temperature was 76-5°. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare.

History

The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May 1794 when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Ile de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for seventeen and the British for sixteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

Constitution

The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. Under a 1960 Order in Council the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, four ex officio members, five elected and three nominated members of whom at least one must be an unofficial. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy

All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation

The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. This is chargeable on all earned or investment income arising in or derived from the Territory. In addition tax is payable by residents on investment income arising out of the Colony or on earned income remitted thereto, the basis of assessment being income arising in the calendar year preceding year of assessment.

Rates of tax, after deduction of allowances, are:

| Rate | Allowance |
|------|-----------|
| 5%   | Rs. 1,000 of chargeable income |
| 10%  | Rs. 4,000 of chargeable income |
| 15%  | Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income |
| 22½% | Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income |
| 30%  | Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income |
| 40%  | Rs. 10,000 of chargeable income |
| 50%  | Rs. 20,000 of chargeable income |
| 60%  | Rs. 50,000 of chargeable income |
| 65%  | on any excess over Rs. 100,000 |

Companies, partnerships, etc., pay a flat rate of 33½%.

Allowances are made to resident taxpayers:

- Earned income: Rs. 1,750.
- Personal (single): Rs. 3,500.
- Personal (married): Rs. 800 for the first child, Rs. 700 for the second child, Rs. 500 for each child thereafter (max. Rs. 3,000).
- Additional allowance of Rs. 3,500 may be claimed for child studying abroad (max. Rs. 7,000).
- Dependent relative: Rs. 500 (limited to one relative) if relative is infirm, maintained by claimant and not in receipt of an income exceeding Rs. 500.
In addition, allowances may be claimed in respect of life insurance, superannuation, alimony and deductions against plant and machinery owned and operated by the assessee.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue Rs. | Expenditure Rs. |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1960 | 5,510,854   | 6,739,177       |
| 1961 | 5,471,811   | 7,086,360       |
| 1962 | 6,829,392   | 7,164,092       |
| 1963 | 6,986,327   | 7,897,710       |
| 1964 | 7,823,519   | 8,722,740       |

In 1964, 45·37% of revenue was derived from customs and 25·66% from direct taxes. The largest heads of expenditure were:

- Medical, Rs. 1,278,676.
- Education, Rs. 1,396,341.
- Police, Rs. 719,915.
- Public Works (Recurrent), Rs. 677,887.

The grant-in-aid to this Colony for 1964 was Rs. 1,142,000, but is not expected to exceed Rs. 900,000; a decline due to revenue buoyancy.

### Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Notes of 1 rupee and 50 cents are however being gradually withdrawn from circulation. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling backed and worth 1s. 6d.

### Development Plans

Expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds for 1964 was Rs. 2,925,753 against the original allotment of Rs. 1,198,892 plus original allotment made during the year.

The main headings of total expenditure up to 1.12.1964 were:

- **Natural Resources** Rs. 5,228,835

#### Post-Secondary Education

Includes sixth forms, teacher, vocational and technical training

In 1964, the sum of Rs. 1,396,341 or 13·6% of the Colony’s budget was expended on education. In addition the Roman Catholic Mission expended a total of Rs. 220,770 this being made up largely of contributions to joint Mission/Government building programmes of expenditure on repairs to buildings and on the rebuilding or partial re-building of several mission schools. Funds allocated under C.D. & W. Schemes for education during the year amounted to Rs. 584,466. Thus the total expenditure from public funds was Rs. 1,897,920 and from Mission funds Rs. 220,770.
Libraries

Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust and there are small libraries run by the Co-operative Book Society, the Roman Catholic Mission and the Alliance Française. In addition there are two well equipped secondary grammar school libraries not normally open to the public.

The Carnegie Library has a branch at Grand 'Anse, Praslin.

Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has few diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria, yellow fever and relapsing fever are absent, filariasis is infrequent and there has been no smallpox for many years. Several cases of leprosy are however found each year. Amoebiasis and other intestinal parasitic diseases such as ankylostomiasis, giardiasis, helminthiasis and balantidium coli dysentery are becoming even more common than before. Poor conditions of sanitation and increasing overcrowding are the main causes of this increase. There has been no progress in the programme for improving sanitation in Victoria which is the most crowded area.

There has been considerable progress in the tuberculosis follow-up scheme. This scheme followed the W.H.O. (World Health Organization) survey of TB in 1961, when at least 1,600 persons were found to require further investigation. In January 1963 there remained 180 suspect active W.H.O. cases and 1,041 suspect inactive cases. The 180 suspect active cases were investigated in 1963 as well as 843 contacts of proven active cases. The follow-up was completed in 1964 when 841 suspect inactive cases were seen. Here follows a brief resumé of figures:

(a) Cases under treatment at end December 1963 .. .. .. 349
(b) Cases notified during 1964 .. .. .. 92
(c) Cases discharged cured 1964 .. .. None
(d) Cases died 1964 .. .. .. 14
Total cases still on treatment end December 1964 .. .. .. 269

A Sanatorium of 87 beds and 4 cots was completed in 1964. This sanatorium, in conjunction with amended public health laws, will help considerably in isolating open cases of tuberculosis and it is hoped that the segregation thus possible will reduce the number of new cases. Help is being sought from W.H.O. in connection with the problem of tuberculosis which is presently the most pressing Public Health problem.

Venereal diseases have shown a slight increase over 1963. The increase is for both syphilis and gonorrhoea. Together with the high rate of new infections, there are a large number of persons with latent stages of syphilis. (Some 10% of all Khan Reactions are positive; and Khan tests are routine for the catering trade, new Government employees, labourers for outer islands and for ante-natal patients). For the control of this disease application has been made to W.H.O. for help.

Public Health Service is under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health. Staff shortages have, however, so far made it necessary for the M.O.H. to spend much of his time doing ordinary Medical Officer's duties. Until a full-time M.O.H. is available, the Public Health Section will remain handicapped. In spite of these difficulties the Public Health Section is continuously increasing the range and type of its work.

Under the Chief Health Inspector the Health Inspectors have tried to improve hygiene and sanitary methods while helping in home education for feeding and dieting of children. Under the Chief Health Inspector are 7 Health Inspectors of whom one is stationed in Praslin district. There are 14 Public Health Nurses of whom one is in Praslin and the others are in Mahé. Of these, three are entirely occupied with TB nursing while most of the others include TB nursing with their other duties which are mainly child and maternal Welfare. The maternal welfare clinics are run in co-operation with the Medical Officer in charge of the Maternity Unit.

Child Welfare Clinics are also well attended. These are run in conjunction with U.N.I.C.E.F. which provides equipment, and Colonial Development Funds which are employed to build the health centres. So far, 3 of these centres were in use by the end of the year but a total of 17 places are used for the clinics which are held in Mahé, Praslin and La Digue. The U.N.I.C.E.F. milk and vitamin scheme is also controlled from the Child and Maternal Health Centres.

Communications

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 80 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15-20 feet. Tarmac surfacing and widening to 20 feet of all roads is in progress, 48½ miles having been completed.

A thrice-weekly service by motor launch, carrying some 100 passengers, is in operation between Victoria, Mahé and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. Passenger ships of the British India Line and of the Eastern Shipping Corporation combine to operate a service calling twice a month (once eastward and once westward) in the case of the former line, and twice every alternate month eastward and once westward in the case of the latter. The British India ships run from Durban to Bombay, and the Eastern Shipping Corporation operates from Dar-es-Salaam and Mombasa to Bombay.

Occasional passenger-carrying cargo boats run directly from London (Brocklebank Line) or from Singapore (Royal InterOcean Line).
Broadcasting

Radio Seychelles at Union Vale, Victoria, Mahé, broadcasts nightly for two hours on a wavelength of 224·5 metres, 1,336 kc/s. with an output of 600 watts.

The service is under the direction of the Director of Tourism and Information. The station commenced broadcasting in May 1965. Reports of good reception have been received from Coëtivy about 150 miles to the South of Mahé and from Agalega about 300 miles south of Mahé, in addition to good coverage over Mahé, Praslin and La Digue.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 6,700 are so employed. Approximate numbers employed in other occupations in 1964 were:

- Domestic service: 2,170
- Public Works: 3,100
- Public administration: 310
- Trade and commerce: 495
- Skilled workers: 2,660

There are thirteen registered Trade Unions:

1. The Seychelles Teachers' Union.
2. The Seychelles Cable and Wireless Limited Staff Union.
3. The Seychelles Christian Workers Union.
4. Licensed Bakers Union.
5. The Seychelles Stevedores Winchmen and Dock Workers Union.
6. The Union Lighterage Workers and Staff Union.
7. The Seychelles Government Un-Established Staff Union.
8. Seamen Union.
9. Transport and General Workers Union.
10. The Seychelles Civil Servant Union.
11. The Plantation, Agriculture and Allied Workers Union.
12. The Union Lighterage Executive, Technical and Clerical Staff Union.
13. The Seychelles Army Pensioners Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

An agricultural census was held in October 1960 when livestock was recorded as:—Cattle, 1,589; Goats, 260; Pigs, 3,058; Poultry, 21,673; there are also some 6,000 wild goats in Aldabra Island.

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,500-2,000 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds' eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally-made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production is increasing.

In 1964, 32·6% of the total imports came from the United Kingdom, 38·8% from Commonwealth countries and 28·6% from foreign sources.

In the same year 76·5% of domestic export (mainly copra) went to India, 8·1% to the United Kingdom, 3·2% to Commonwealth countries other than India and 12·2% to foreign countries.

Tourist Trade

The number of tourists who visited Seychelles in 1964 was 971 and an increase has continued in 1965. In September 1965 a record number of over 150 tourists visited the Islands. Insufficiency of sea communications and the entire absence of schedule air services still puts a brake on a promising industry which is estimated to have earned about Rs. 800,000 in 1964.
