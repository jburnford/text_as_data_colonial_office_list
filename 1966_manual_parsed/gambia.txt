THE GAMBIA

Following a general election held in May 1962 The Gambia attained full internal self-government on 4th October 1963.

Agreement was reached at a Conference held in London July 1964, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and The Gambia attained independence and became a member of the Commonwealth on 18th February 1965.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is now the channel of communication between Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and Her Majesty's Government in The Gambia.

Basic information about The Gambia can be found in the 1965 edition of the Colonial Office List.
