BRITISH HONDURAS

Area

British Honduras lies on the Caribbean coast of Central America, bounded on the north and part of the west by Mexico and by Guatemala in the remainder of the west and south. Its land area is about 8,866 square miles, which includes a number of islets, known as "cayes", lying off the coast.

Population

The estimated population at the end of 1964 was 104,450. At the census taken in April 1960 the de facto total population was 90,019. The main racial groups are: Creoles, American Indians (Maya) and Caribs. There are also a number of persons of East Indian and Spanish descent. The races are, however, now heavily inter-mixed and a great many persons would have considerable difficulty in deciding to which group they belong.

English is the official language and the language taught in the schools. Spanish is also in common use, chiefly by the Indians, whose language it is tending to replace. The term Creole is now commonly used to denote local negroes and persons of negro extraction; it is also used in respect of persons of mixed Spanish and Indian descent.

Principal Towns

| Population |
|------------|
| Belize City (capital) | 32,690 |
| Corozal Town | 3,164 |
| Orange Walk Town | 2,141 |
| San Ignacio | 1,819 |
| Stann Creek Town | 5,276 |
| Punta Gorda | 1,753 |

Geographical Features

The coastline is, for the most part, flat and swampy, but the country rises gradually towards the interior. The Maya Mountains and the Cockscombs, which reach a height of 3,700 feet, form the backbone of the southern half of the Colony. All of the western (Cayo) District is hilly and includes the Mountain Pine Ridge most of which lies between 1,000 and 2,000 feet above sea level but rises in parts to around 3,000 feet. The northern districts are also hilly except towards the coast but contain considerable areas of low tableland. There are seventeen principal rivers, of which the Belize River is the most important. None is navigable by vessels over five feet draught and few for any notable distance. An estimated 92% of the mainland is under forest.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and on the whole agreeable to non-tropical peoples. In the capital, Belize City, the temperature range during the year is 50° to 96° with an average mean of 78-5°. Most of the year the heat and humidity are tempered by sea breezes. This description applies with small variation along the whole coastal area. Inland the day temperatures, during the dry season, tend to be higher, up to 100°, but drop considerably at night. Rainfall increases from north to south:

| Annual average Inches |
|-----------------------|
| Corozal (north) | 51 |
| Belize City (central) | 63 |
| El Cayo (western central) | 52 |
| Stann Creek (upper south) | 147 |
| Toledo (south) | 175 |

There are two dry seasons, the main one from March to May and the other in August and September (called the Maugre Season).

The Colony has been struck from time to time by hurricanes.

In recent years:
- a hurricane struck Belize City on the 10th September 1931 causing heavy loss of life and property;
- on the 27th September 1955 Hurricane "Janet" struck the northern part of the country completely destroying the town of Corozal and damaging dozens of villages in the Orange Walk District. Damage was estimated at over $4 million.
- on the 15th July 1960 Hurricane "Abby"
struck the area of the Sittee River, south of Stann Creek, causing some damage to crops and dwellings;

on the 24th July 1961 Hurricane "Anna" wrought fairly extensive damage to crops and houses in the villages of Seine Bight and Placencia and Sittee River and almost completely destroyed banana plantations at Waha Leaf in the Stann Creek District;

on the 31st October 1961 Hurricane "Hattie" caused 262 deaths and most serious damage to Belize City, Stann Creek and other parts of the country.

History

The present Settlement was apparently established in 1638 but British sea rovers were frequenting the Bay from long before that year and there is some evidence that a Settlement was formed in or around 1603. Logwood was the attraction, and the 1638 Settlement was augmented from time to time by sea rovers and—notably after the capture of Jamaica by British forces in 1655—by disbanded British soldiers and sailors. In the Treaty of Madrid, 1670, Spain recognized Britain's sovereignty over the Bay Settlement.

Concurrently another and larger British Settlement was building up on the Mosquito Indian Coast, far to the south of British Honduras. Modern historians frequently confuse the two Settlements; but although they assisted each other on occasion, they were entirely separate organizations with quite different forms of government. The Moskito Indians stubbornly and successfully resisted Spanish intrusion but welcomed and became loyal allies of the British settlers. The Moskito Coast settlers were known as the Shoremen and the Bay settlers as the Baymen. In 1786 Britain handed over the Moskito Coast to Spain in return for a small and comparatively worthless strip of land contiguous to the Bay Settlement. Some of the Shoremen moved to Jamaica and the rest were compulsorily evacuated to the strip, where they became merged with the Baymen.

The Bay Settlement was a piece of purely British pioneering. The Spaniards found plentiful supplies of logwood, and Indians for slaves, in Northern Yucatan and settled there. Southern Yucatan, on the other hand, was by then practically devoid of Indians and its littoral was a wilderness of mosquito-infested mangrove swamps guarded by lee-shore reefs and tricky channels. The Spaniards therefore left this coast alone until the British began to settle around the mouth of the Belize River. The export of logwood from the Bay Settlement broke the highly profitable Spanish monopoly, brought great prosperity to Britain's wool and cloth-dyeing trades and caused Spain to launch attack after attack on the Settlement in an effort to drive out her competitors.

This armed aggression continued until 1798, when the Spaniards invaded the Settlement in strong naval and military force. The Baymen, although badly under-armed and heavily outnumbered, resisted and, after several days of skirmishing, the forces met in sea battle off St. George's Cay. Supported by H.M. Sloop Merlin, the Baymen fought with such determination that the Spaniards were forced to retreat. This was Spain's last attempt to dislodge the Baymen by force of arms.

Until 1786 the Baymen governed themselves. In that year, after many petitions from the Baymen, England appointed and sent out a Superintendent, but the office was allowed to lapse in 1791. In 1797 Colonel Thomas Barrow was appointed Superintendent and was also given the title of Commander-in-Chief (held by the Governors of the Colony ever since) to enable him to organize the defence against the obviously impending Spanish attack. Thereafter the office of Superintendent continued until 1862, when it was replaced by that of Lieutenant-Governor, under the Governor of Jamaica and the Settlement raised to the status of a Colony. The Baymen resented being subordinated to Jamaica and in 1884 the Colony was detached from Jamaica and given a Governor.

Constitution

In 1954 the Legislative Council was replaced by a Legislative Assembly composed of nine elected members, three ex officio members and a Speaker and three unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The status of the Executive Council was changed to that of chief instrument of policy and it was composed of the Governor, as Chairman, three ex officio members and six members of the Legislative Assembly. The latter were elected by the Assembly but included not less than two of the nominated unofficial members of that body. Universal adult suffrage was also introduced in 1954, and the first general election under the new Constitution was held on 28th April 1954. The only fully organized party, the People's United Party, gained eight of the nine elected seats. The principle of Steering Members, appointed by the Governor from among the unofficial members of the Executive Council, as the first step towards full ministerial status, was adopted in 1955.

At the general elections which took place on the 20th March 1957 the People's United Party gained all nine of the elected seats.

In February 1960 a Conference was convened in London by H.M. Government to consider inter alia proposals for the development of the Constitution of British Honduras. This conference was attended by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State with their Advisers; the Governor of British Honduras and official and unofficial members of the Government; and the leaders of the political parties in the territory.

The Conference decided to adopt a ministerial form of Government based on a revised Legislative Assembly and Executive Council. This revised Constitution was introduced in March 1961 following a general election. The new Legislative Assembly presided over by a Speaker, consisted of 18 members elected by the general public, five nominated members and two ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary (formerly known as the Colonial Secretary) and the Attorney General). The normal life of the Assembly was four years. The revised Executive Council under the chairmanship of the Governor, consisted of two ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, responsible inter alia for defence, security and external affairs, and the Attorney General) and six unofficial members holding various departmental portfolios as Ministers, of whom at least one was a nominated member of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the political party obtaining a majority at a general election for the Legislative Assembly seats was appointed First Minister and the remaining five unofficial members of the Executive Council were elected by the unofficial members of the Legislative Assembly from among their own number. As regards the five nominated
members of the Legislative Assembly, these were filled by the Governor, after consultation with the First Minister in respect of two seats and after consultation with the leader of the minority party in respect of one seat, the remaining two seats being filled by the Governor after consultation with the leaders of both the majority and minority parties. Further details are set out in a White Paper issued by H.M. Government as Cmnd. 984.

At the general election held in March 1961, the People's United Party, led by Mr. George Price, won all the 18 elected seats in the Legislative Assembly. Mr. Price was thereupon appointed First Minister and his Ministry has since held office.

The former post of Financial Secretary was replaced by that of Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, a Ministry which is in the portfolio of the First Minister.

At a Constitutional Conference held in London in July 1963, it was agreed that the Colony should have a Ministerial system of internal self-government with a two-chamber legislature. Under the new Constitution which was introduced on the 6th January 1964, the Governor has special responsibilities for defence, external affairs, internal security and the safeguarding of the terms and conditions of service of public officers. Further, for so long as the Government of British Honduras continues to receive moneys from the United Kingdom Government in the form of grant-in-aid of the current revenues the Governor has a special responsibility for maintaining or securing the financial and economic stability of British Honduras and for ensuring that any condition attached to any financial grant or loan made by Her Majesty's Government is complied with.

The Executive Council has been replaced by a Cabinet consisting of a Premier and other Ministers. Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier. The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears to him to be likely to command the support of the majority party in the House of Representatives.

The bi-cameral Legislature is known as the National Assembly and comprises a House of Representatives and a Senate.

The House of Representatives consists of 18 members elected under the system of universal adult suffrage. The Speaker may be elected by the House from amongst its own number or from outside the House but the Deputy Speaker is elected by the House from amongst its own number.

The Senate consists of eight members appointed by the Governor. Five are appointed on the advice of the Premier, two on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and one after consulting such persons as the Governor considers appropriate. The President may be elected by the Senate from amongst its own number, or from outside the Senate, but the Vice-President is elected by the Senate from amongst its own number.

Land Policy

The alienation of Crown land is carefully controlled to prevent, as far as possible, the acquisition of such land for purely speculative, non-productive purposes. No racial discrimination is exercised.

During 1953 and 1954 a land use survey was carried out. A land policy, based on the findings and recommendations of the Survey Team, has been formulated and was published by Government in 1958.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on a graduated scale rising from 5% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 45% on all income over $25,000. Surtax is levied on the first $2,000 in excess of $8,000 of chargeable income at the rate of 10%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 15%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 20%; and on the remainder at 25%. Deductions allowed against income are a personal allowance of $600, plus allowances for wife, children, dependent relatives, life assurance premiums, earned income and gifts to charity. The rate of tax on companies is 40% of the chargeable income of the company.

Public Finance (see also section immediately below)

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1960 | 8,947,958   | 9,795,852       |
| 1961 | 10,450,525  | 9,044,140       |
| 1962 | 12,011,351  | 13,293,958      |
| 1963 | 15,546,263  | 17,219,056      |
| 1964 | 14,562,888* | 15,262,888*     |

*Estimates.

In 1964 $4,760,105 of the true revenue was derived from Customs duties and charges and $2,866,670 from internal taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- General administrative services: $2,264,000*
- Economic Services: $3,591,000*
- Social and Other Services: $7,198,000*

*Provisional figures

The Public Debt of the Colony at the end of 1964 amounted to $7,328,704. Sinking funds on hand amounted to $1,422,653, leaving $5,906,051 as the net outstanding debt.

Financial Assistance towards Reconstruction after Hurricane "Hattie" (1961)

The Government of the United Kingdom made approximately £5 million available for hurricane rehabilitation and reconstruction after Hurricane "Hattie" in 1961.

Of this amount some £1 million was spent on emergency assistance immediately following the hurricane.

Of the balance, £1½ million was earmarked for the establishment of a new capital city some 50 miles inland. This project has now been approved and some preliminary clearing has already been done.

The remaining balance was approved for the hurricane reconstruction and development programme which ends on 30th June 1966. The major item in this programme comprises housing grants and loans, most of which have been issued.

Currency

The unit of currency is the British Honduras dollar which is exchanged at four to the £ sterling. Notes of $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 are issued and there are coins of 50, 25 and 10 cents pieces in cupro nickel, 5 cents in nickel/brass and bronze 1 cent pieces.

Development Plans

In addition to almost $25 million contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds during the period 1945-1965, a further allocation of $4·8 million was made to this country under the Commonwealth Development Act, 1963, for the period up to 31st March 1966. The major portion of the funds is being used to make a start with the
implementation of some of the "grant" worthy projects in the British Honduras Government's seven-year Development Plan which, based on the United Nations Economic Survey Mission's report on the country, was placed before the Legislative Assembly in December 1963. It envisages a total expenditure of about $48 million; of this sum it is now proposed that about $14 million should be financed by loan, a small part of which is to be raised locally. The main items in the Plan comprise:

| Item                                      | Amount |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry          |        |
| and Lands and Surveys                     | 7·6    |
| Communications                             | 16·0   |
| Education and Training                    | 8·2    |
| Housing                                   | 8·4    |
| Medical and Health                        | 1·6    |
| Water and Sewerage                        | 4·0    |

A Development Finance Corporation has been established under the provisions of the Development Corporation Ordinance No. 2 of 1961 as amended by Ordinance No. 15 of 1963. The purpose of the Corporation is to expand and strengthen the economy of the country. The share capital of the Corporation is $4 million divided into 400,000 shares at $10 a share. There are just over 2,600 shareholders holding 31,885 shares.

The Reconstruction and Development Corporation, which was set up to manage certain funds allocated to the general reconstruction programme and to secure the laying out of and the development of new towns, was again active in 1964. It approved grants and loans for housing rehabilitation to the value of over $2 million up to the end of 1964. Loan funds amounting to approximately $40,000 were also provided for citrus and cocoa growers, fishermen and tradesmen during 1963.

Other Development

Tate and Lyle Ltd. has taken over the Corozal Sugar Factory Ltd. and its subsidiaries. The Corozal Sugar Factory Ltd. produced just over 35,000 tons of sugar in 1965 for the domestic and export market. Tate and Lyle Ltd. intends to expand the existing operations of the present factory to 45,000 tons. Another factory in the Orange Walk district to produce a further 30,000 tons of sugar by 1967 is now under construction. The total estimated investment is $31 million. It is expected that the two factories will together achieve a total production of 175,000 tons or more by 1971/72 subject to market conditions.

United Fruit Co. Ltd., the parent Company of locally incorporated Belize Banana Company, signed an agreement with Government to investigate the establishment of operations in the Swasey-Bladen-Monkey River Area which would have involved the growing and processing of bananas and other agricultural crops, and the by-products from such crops, for sale in world markets. As a result of detailed engineering studies completed in accordance with the terms of the agreement the company decided that the project was not economically feasible in the light of present and projected conditions.

Hercules B. H. Ltd., and its subsidiary Pine Harvesters Ltd., which together invested some $5 million in a project to produce resin from pine stumps, informed Government during 1965 that they were reluctantly compelled to eventually cease operations due to (a) changes in the world supply of resin, (b) unforeseen difficulties in harvesting pine stumps, (c) information as a result of further recent surveys that the quantity of available pine stumps is much less than previously estimated.

Salada Foods Inc. acquired the Commonwealth Development Corporation holdings in the Stann Creek Valley and planted out over 1,000,000 acres of citrus. It has established a plant for the production of frozen concentrates for the Canadian market. The Citrus orchards in the Stann creek Valley recovered quickly from the severe damage done by Hurricane "Hattie".

Education

Primary education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. It is conducted almost entirely by the denominations, with a government subsidy. Similarly, with the exception of a Government Technical College, the secondary schools are all run by the denominations.

The Minister of Education is responsible for education under the general authority of the Education Ordinance, 1962. His Chief Executive Officer is the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Education, and his Chief Administrative Officer is the Chief Education Officer. A Primary Education Board and an Advisory Council for Secondary and Further Education advise him on the respective branches of education.

In 1964 there were 133 primary grant-aided schools (of which 2 were maintained by Government), 24 private primary schools, 15 recognised denominational secondary schools and a Technical College run by the Government, as well as a special school for handicapped children conducted on a semi-private basis. The total enrolment in primary schools was 26,322, and in secondary schools 2,113. There were two Teacher Training Colleges offering a two-year course, and an Intermediate Teacher Training College giving an intensive twenty-week course for new entrants to the teaching profession.

There is no local institution at university level, and scholarships are awarded to the University of the West Indies and universities and similar institutions in Britain and other countries. The University maintains an Extra Mural Department with a Resident Tutor in Belize City.

Expenditure on education from the local budget in 1964 was $1,260,377, representing about 15% of the budget. In addition, Colonial Development and Welfare grants from the United Kingdom amounted to $732,533, covering the period April 1964 to March 1966.

Libraries, etc.

A statutory Library Board conducts the British Honduras Library Service, which falls under the portfolio of the Minister of Education and Housing. The Library Service aims at complete coverage of the country, and at the 31st December 1964 had 63 service-points—a Central Library, a Children's Library, a Technical Library, a branch and two smaller points in Belize City, a branch in each of the five district towns, and 52 sub-libraries in villages throughout the country. The majority of the service-points have reading and reference sections. The service is a free one. At the end of 1964 there were 15,907 registered members, and the bookstock was 64,435 volumes.

The Central Library is accommodated in the Baron Bliss Institute, which also houses the Extra Mural Department of the University of the West Indies, and has a modern stage and auditorium. Evening classes are conducted regularly by the Extra Mural Department, and dramatic productions are held. The Library Service held a successful Book Fair during 1964.
The British Council has an office and a Representative in Belize City and provides a small library for the public.

**Health**

The country is relatively free from endemic diseases. Malaria, which was most prevalent, is no longer a problem, owing to a Malaria Eradication Programme operated on a tripartite basis by Government, W.H.O., and U.N.I.C.E.F. The main general hospital, with 162 beds, is in Belize City and there are small hospitals in each of the 5 districts, all run by Government, and with a total bed strength of 142. There is also a 13 bed private hospital in the capital. Some 20 Government and Mission rural dispensaries in the more important villages are each in charge of a qualified rural health nurse. At present there are four villages without nurses due to a shortage of staff. A nurses training school and hostel was opened in new quarters in December 1963.

Two Health Centres, a Venereal Disease Clinic, an infirmary and a mental hospital are maintained by Government in Belize City. A temporary Tuberculosis Sanatorium, also maintained by Government, has been established some 18 miles outside Belize City to replace the one destroyed in the 1961 hurricane.

Expenditure on medical and health services from general revenue during 1964 was $941,415.

**Communications**

The Belize International Airport is located about ten miles north-west of Belize City. It is the principal airport of the Colony. International air services to the country are operated by the following airlines:

- Transpores Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (T.A.C.A. International Airlines).
- Servicio Aereo de Honduras, S.A. (S.A.H.S.A.).
- Transpores Aereos Nacionales, S.A. (T.A.N. airlines).
- Maya Airlines.

Thrice weekly services to New Orleans (U.S.A.), Belize City and San Salvador via Guatemala City is operated by T.A.C.A. The Miami/Belize City/Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula (Honduras) route is operated four times weekly by T.A.N. S.A.H.S.A. operate a twice weekly service from and to San Pedro Sula. Maya Airways operate an internal scheduled air service to district towns and other parts of the country. Air Taxi Service, a new operator, is providing non-scheduled services throughout the country.

There are 605 miles of all-weather main feeder roads, 177 miles of cart roads and bush trails and 158 miles of dry-weather roads maintained by Government. Broken down further, Government maintain:

- 183 miles of asphalt road,
- 270 miles of gravel road,
- 268 miles of marl road, and
- 271 miles of dirt road.

The United Fruit Company maintains a weekly passenger and cargo service between Belize City and New Orleans, U.S.A. The T. and J. Harrison and the Royal Netherlands S/S. lines offer a regular fortnightly cargo service between Belize City and the United Kingdom and Europe respectively, the Royal Netherlands ship offering limited passenger accommodation. The "K" line is now operating a monthly cargo service between Belize City and Japan. The Kirkconnell Bros., Foster Enterprise Company and the Howthorne Trader Company maintain an irregular freighter and passenger service between Jamaica, Cayman Islands and Belize City. The Esso Tanker operates a monthly service from Aruba with petroleum products. A three times weekly cargo service is now established by the Canada, Jamaica Line from Canada to Belize City.

In 1964, a total of 43 steam and motor vessels and 27 sailing vessels, 1,806 gross tons in all, registered at the port of Belize City.

**Telecommunications**

Cable & Wireless Ltd. have been granted a licence to operate the external telecommunications service of the country which also includes radio-telephone facilities with major towns and cities in the U.S.A., the Caribbean and the United Kingdom.

Cable & Wireless Ltd., on behalf of Government, operate a fully automatic telephone system within Belize City.

There is also an internal telecommunications system in operation.

**Information Service**

On 1st November 1962, Information and Broadcasting were separated and two new Departments formed. The Government Information Service is now in charge of all Government publicity material, press liaison, campaigns and exhibitions to project the activities and policies of the Government to the people at home and abroad.

**Broadcasting**

Government operates a radio broadcasting service (Radio Belize) transmitting from Belize City on the following frequencies and powers: 840 kc/s. (361 metres), 20kW. and 3-3 Mc/s. (90 metres), 5 kW. to 20 kW. Programmes are given in English and Spanish and include both local and foreign news, announcements of local interest, local features, transcribed music and plays. Daily time totals about eleven hours and the Station began broadcasting commercial advertisements on payment of a fee as from the 1st July, 1964.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the working population are engaged in agriculture on their own account.

The estimated numbers engaged in the principal wage earning occupations at the end of 1963 were:

| Occupation                                      | Number |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing and Hunting     | 4,426  |

| Total                                           | 15,871 |

Membership of trade unions totalled 3,689 at the end of 1963. There are ten trade unions in the Colony.
Main Crops and Products

Indian corn (maize), beans and peas, rice, sugar, cassava and yams are the principal food crops of the country. The main export crops are citrus fruits, processed citrus and sugar. Cattle, pigs and poultry are raised throughout the country. Sugar is the principal export product in the form of raw sugar and molasses. Timber is also a main export product. These consist mainly of mahogany, pine and cedar. Rosewood, Banak, Santa Maria and other woods are also exported. Efforts are being directed to building up the country's scale-fish industry, and an export trade to the United States, chiefly in lobsters, is well established.

Industries established in and near Belize City are a sawmill, a cigarette factory, two aluminium door, window and louvre factories, a garment factory and several small furniture factories. In other parts of the country there are two canneries operating in the Stann Creek Valley on citrus products, a cement block and tile factory at the border of the Belize-Cayo Districts, a resin factory in Stann Creek District and a sugar factory in the Corozal District.

* This is not a true presentation as certain import records for August, 1961, were destroyed in Hurricane "Hattie".

In 1938 19·1% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 12·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 68·0% from foreign countries. The corresponding figures for 1964 were: 24·83%, 13·43% and 61·74%.

In 1938 22·5% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 6·3% to other Commonwealth countries and 71·2% to foreign countries. The corresponding figures for 1964 were: 42·39%, 13·29% and 44·32%.

The chief imports are normally vehicles, motor spirits, machinery, cotton and artificial silk piecegoods, beans and peas, condensed, evaporated and powdered milk, flour, butter, margarine and lard substitutes. There are, of course, also likely to be special imports in the four-year reconstruction period (1963–66).

BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY

The British Indian Ocean Territory consists of the islands of the Chagos Archipelago, some 1,200 miles north-east of Mauritius, and Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches in the Western Indian Ocean. The Chagos Archipelago was formerly administered by the Government of Mauritius and the other islands by that of Seychelles.

The Chagos Archipelago covers an area from 7° 39' to 4° 41'S and from 70° 50' to 72° 41'E. It is composed of a huge shoal area, the Great Chagos Bank, and six groups of islands or atolls.

Aldabra lies about 760 miles from Mahe, 700 miles from the East African coast and 200 miles from Madagascar. The seaward face of the rock has overhanging cliffs of 12-15 feet, but sand dunes inshore reach 50 feet in their elevation.

Farquhar is an atoll lying about 500 miles south west of Mahe with a shallow central lagoon. The aggregate land area of the fringing islands is about 2½ square miles.

Desroches is an atoll lying 20 miles east of Poivre Islets in the Amirantes. The land area is 1·87 square miles. The island rises to about 14 feet and is covered with coconut palms.

The islands generally have an equable and maritime climate, tropical during the austral summer and sub-tropical in winter.

History (See separate sections under Mauritius and Seychelles)

The population of the islands numbers about 1,500 persons, either Mauritians or Seychellois, mainly employed on copra estates, guano extraction and the turtle industry. There are no towns in the territory.

The British Indian Ocean Territory was established under an Order in Council made on the 8th November 1965. This provided for the appointment of a Commissioner who is responsible for the administration of the territory and who is resident in Mahe, Seychelles (see p. 149).

The legislation in force in the individual islands immediately prior to the establishment of the British Indian Ocean Territory remains applicable. (See separate entries under Mauritius and Seychelles).

The currency in circulation to be that used prior to the establishment of the territory. The unit is the rupee, sterling backed and worth 1s. 6d. (see separate sections under Mauritius and Seychelles).

There are no air communications. The islands are, however, well placed for communications in the Indian Ocean area and small vessels ply between them and between the islands of Mauritius and Seychelles.

Commissioner: Rt. Hon. Earl of Oxford and Asquith, K.C.M.G.
