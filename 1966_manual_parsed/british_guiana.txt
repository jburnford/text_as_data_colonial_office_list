BRITISH GUIANA

Area

British Guiana lies on the north-east coast of the South American Continent. Its area is 83,000 square miles, divided into three counties as follows:

| County       | Square miles |
|--------------|--------------|
| Essequibo    | 61,660       |
| Berbice      | 16,920       |
| Demerara     | 4,420        |

Population

At 31st December 1964 the population was 638,030. Estimates of racial groups in 1964 were:

- East Indians: 320,070
- African descent: 199,830
- Mixed descent: 75,990
- Portuguese: 6,380
- Europeans other than Portuguese: 2,420
- Chinese: 3,910
- Amerindians: 29,430

The provisional number of births and deaths in 1964 were 25,393 and 4,945 respectively. The infant mortality rate in 1963 was 55 per 1,000 live births.

Principal Towns

The City of Georgetown, Demerara, is the capital and with its environs has a population of approximately 162,000. Population in the city proper numbers about 78,000. New Amsterdam, Berbice, has a population of 15,000 approximately. Mackenzie-Wismar-Christianburg, a bauxite mining township up the Demerara River, has a population of 20,000.

Geographical Features

The Colony may be divided into three zones, viz., the low-lying coastland, the mountain region and the intermediate region. The coastland comprises a low-lying, swampy strip of marine alluvium which varies in width from about ten miles in the west to about 40 miles in the east. Its flat, grassy savannahs would mostly be inundated during the rainy season but for artificial drainage and sea defences. Almost the whole of the population and agricultural activity of the Colony is concentrated between the Pomeroon River and Corentyne River along this strip. The mountain region, known as the Pakaraima Range, lies along the western boundary of the Colony. Mount Roraima, a plateau 22 square miles in extent and over 9,000 feet above sea level, is the highest elevation. The intermediate region, the largest area of the Colony, lies mainly to the east and south. It is almost entirely forest clad. The total area under forest is approximately 70,000 square miles.

There are many large rivers which with their numerous tributaries form a vast network of waterways. All the large rivers are impeded above the tideway by rapids, cataracts and falls. Kaieteur, one of the largest single-drop waterfalls in the world, is situated on the Potaro River. It is nearly five times the height of Niagara and has a vertical drop of 741 feet with a further 80 feet of rapids and falls. Its width varies from 350 to 400 feet.

Climate

The climate is pleasant for the greater part of the year; it is hot only in the summer months. The mean temperature is 80°F. with a daily range of about 18°F. on the coast and a slightly wider range inland. There are two wet and two dry seasons in the coastal regions—the long wet season usually from April to August and the long dry season from September to mid-November. This is followed by wet weather until the end of January, and the short dry season until April. The mean annual rainfall is 93 inches, but there are wide variations in the rainfall over the region, ranging from 80 to 100 inches along the coast and falling as low as 60 inches in the savannahs of the interior where the dry season is October to February and the wet season May to August. The nights are uniformly cool.

Slight earth tremors are felt occasionally, but no damage is caused.

History

There have been some discrepancies in dates and other matters in the various historical accounts but the following brief statement is based upon what is taken to be the most authentic version.

In history there are really five Guianas—Spanish Guiana (now Venezuela), Portuguese Guiana (now Brazil), Dutch Guiana (now Surinam), French Guiana and British Guiana. A navigable river was so important to the Europeans who first visited the coastline between the Amazon and the Orinoco that they gave the Amerindian name of the river to the surrounding countryside. Thus the three counties of British Guiana are Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice, and the areas known as Rupununi, Mazaruni, Potaro, Cuyuni, Pomeroon and Corentyne take their names from the rivers that flow through them. Guiana is an Amerindian word meaning "Land of Waters."

The coastline of the country between the Amazon and Orinoco was first traced by Spanish sailors in 1499 and 1500 and the first European settlements were almost certainly Spanish or Portuguese. The Dutch established a settlement on the Pomeroon in 1581 but were evicted by Spanish and Indians (probably in 1596) and retired to Kyk-over-al-up the Essequibo. In 1627 Dutch merchants settled on the Berbice. The Dutch West Indian Company, formed in 1621, controlled these settlements.

The first English attempt at settlement in the area lasted from 1604-06, on the Oiapock River (now French Guiana). Fresh ventures in 1609 and 1629 failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, founded a settlement in Surinam in 1651 but this was captured by the Dutch in 1667. In October of the same year it was recaptured by a British expedition from Barbados, the leaders being unaware of the signing of the Treaty of Breda in the previous July. It was mid-1668 before the Dutch finally obtained possession of Surinam in accordance with the terms of that Treaty. In effect Surinam was exchanged for New York, though this was not explicit in the terms of the Treaty.

The Dutch retained their hold on the territory with more or less firmness, now yielding to England and now to France or Portugal, until 1796 when during the war of the French Revolution it was captured by a British fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain and finally ceded to her in 1814, exclusive of Surinam.

Constitution

Following the decisions of the Constitutional Conference held in London in March 1960, the British Guiana (Constitution) Order in Council,
1961 was passed, providing for a new constitution giving full internal self-government to British Guiana. The new constitution, which came into effect on 18th July 1961, provided for a bi-cameral legislature—a Legislative Assembly of 35 members, elected by universal adult suffrage, and a nominated Senate of 13 members.

These provisions were amended by the British Guiana (Constitution) Order in Council, 1964. (See below.)

The Executive body, called the Council of Ministers, is presided over by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the member of the Legislative Assembly who, in the judgment of the Governor, is best able to command the confidence of a majority of the members of that Chamber. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Legislative Assembly.

The Governor must exercise all his powers in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers except where otherwise expressly stated (the notable exceptions are in respect of defence and external affairs).

A Bill of Rights incorporated in the Constitution enumerates in detail rights to equality, personal freedom and property and provides for their enforcement by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution also provides for the establishment of Judicial, Public and Police Service Commissions, which will ultimately have executive responsibility for appointments, discipline and dismissals in the Services for which they are responsible. Judges of the Supreme Court may be removed only for inability or misconduct and then only by the Governor on the advice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which itself can be approached only on the recommendations of a locally appointed Judicial tribunal.

Arising out of a resolution passed by the British Guiana Legislature in October 1961, Her Majesty's Government announced in January 1962 its willingness to hold a Constitutional Conference in London in May 1962 to discuss the date and the arrangements to be made for the achievement of independence by British Guiana. The Conference was held in October, having been delayed to await the report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Disturbances which took place in Georgetown in February. Delegates from each of the three political parties represented in the Legislative Assembly attended the Conference. As no agreement could be reached on the terms of a Constitution for Independence, the Conference was adjourned to allow for further discussions between the parties in British Guiana. Since these discussions did not lead to agreement, the Secretary of State reconvened the Conference in October, 1963.

At the resumed conference the leaders of the three political parties reported that they had failed to reach agreement between themselves on the terms of a constitution for independence, and asked the British Government to settle on its own authority all the outstanding political issues. The Secretary of State announced his decisions on 31st October at the closing session of the Conference. The main decisions were:

(a) The Constitution must provide the strongest safeguards to protect minorities;
(b) The electoral system would be changed to proportional representation on a party list system;
(c) The voting age would remain at 21 years;
(d) Elections on the new basis would be held as soon as possible under the supervision of a Special Commissioner from outside British Guiana appointed by the British Government;
(e) After these elections a conference could be convened to settle any remaining constitutional issues and to fix a date for independence;
(f) Documents to implement the decisions would be made available in draft to the leaders before receiving the Secretary of State's final approval;
(g) Additional security forces would be raised locally before independence under the direction of the Governor, who would endeavour to ensure that recruits were not drawn predominantly from any one racial group.

On 25th September 1964 the bi-cameral legislature of the 1961 Constitution was dissolved and by proclamation on the same date the British Guiana (Constitution) Order 1964 was brought into operation. That Order provides for the establishment of a uni-cameral legislature comprising a House of Assembly of 53 members elected by proportional representation. The life of the new legislature is four years unless earlier dissolved. A general election was held on the 7th December 1964, the People's Progressive Party winning 24 seats, the People's National Congress 22 seats and the United Force 7 seats. A P.N.C./U.F. coalition government was formed, with Mr. L. F. S. Burnham, leader of the P.N.C., as Premier and Mr. P. S. D'Aguilar, leader of the U.F. as Minister of Finance.

At the British Guiana Independence Conference held in London in November 1965 it was agreed that British Guiana should become a sovereign independent state under the name of Guyana on the 26th May 1966.

On the 22nd December 1965 two further amendments were made to the Constitution by an Order of the Queen in Council. The first provides that nothing in Article 11(1) of the Constitution (which prohibits discrimination on grounds of race etc.) shall prevent appointments to the police force being made in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on racial problems in the Public Service instituted by the International Commission of Jurists. The second substitutes the title of Prime Minister for that of Premier.

Land Policy

Land in the Colony falls within three categories:

(i) Freehold: (a) alienated by the Dutch prior to 1803; (b) alienated by the Crown;

(ii) Crown land—about 90% of the area of the Colony;

(iii) Colony land, acquired from private owners and the Crown for public purposes.

Crown land may be alienated or leased to any individual with the consent of the Governor on the advice of the Minister of Lands, Mines and Forests; in the case of Colony land with the consent of the Council of Ministers. Absentee lessees must have a legal representative in the Colony. Alienation of Crown Land is restricted to leases for periods not exceeding 25 years.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are Customs, excise and licences, income tax, stamp duties, estate duties, acreage tax, duty on transport and mortgages.
Income tax rates range from 6 cents (for the first $1,200 (£250)) to 70 cents on each $ of chargeable income in the case of individuals. Companies, other than Mutual Life Insurance companies, pay 45%; Mutual Life Insurance companies 25%.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue* | Expenditure* |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1960 | £11,686,403 | £10,477,961 |
| 1961 | £12,569,692 | £11,877,700 |
| 1962 | £12,471,128 | £12,992,402 |
| 1963 | £13,323,490 | £12,919,076 |
| 1964 | £14,245,492 | £14,716,248 |

*Total Colony revenue and expenditure.

In 1964, £4,670,159 in revenue came from Income Tax while Customs and Excise produced £6,744,855. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: £4,440,006
- Administration including:
  - Law and Order: £3,439,796
  - Public Works: £1,607,296
- Economic Development: £950,743

The Public Debt at the end of 1964 was £26,520,629.

**Currency**

New currency notes brought into circulation on 15th November 1965 are issued by the Central Bank of Guyana, which began operations on that date. Currency notes are of denominations $1, $5, $10 and $20; coins are 50 cents, 25 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The Currency is exchangeable with sterling at par. The Guyanese $ has a fixed equivalent value of 4s. 2d., that is £4·80 to £.

**Development Plans**

A Two-Year Development Programme, 1954-55, was launched early in 1954. Expenditure fell short of the estimate of $44 million but public investment over the period stimulated economic activity throughout the colony. The unexpended balances from the Two-Year Programme were incorporated into a Five-Year Development Programme for the period 1955 to 1960.

That Programme was designed mainly to improve and extend basic developmental facilities, e.g., drainage and irrigation, roads, internal transport services and telecommunications; to provide for the establishment of comprehensive schemes of rural electrification and land settlement and for an improvement and expansion of social services, in the fields of health, housing and education. It was financed partly from Colony funds, derived from loans and accumulated surplus revenue balances and partly from Colonial Development and Welfare grants. Expenditure on development projects was as follows:

| Year | Expenditure |
|------|-------------|
| 1964 | £8,965,099  |
| 1963 | £11,479,656 |
| 1962 | £18,800,000 |
| 1961 | £21,659,752 |
| 1960 | £15,772,569 |
| 1959 | £18,757,678 |
| 1958 | £19,877,000 |

Arising from recommendations made by the International Bank Mission after their visit to the Colony in 1953, for the planning and execution of the Development Programme, a Credit Corporation was established to administer credits for the encouragement and development of agriculture, industry, forestry, fisheries, rural and urban housing. The total amount loaned up to the end of 1964 was £28,326,547; repayments totalled £21,999,075.

Regional Development Committees and Area Sub-Committees have been established in each of the twelve administrative districts to assist in general development activities, especially to promote aided self-help schemes and to advise the Credit Corporation on applications for loans.

An Industrial Development Committee was set up in 1957.

A Five-Year Development Programme ended in December 1964. Expenditure amounted to £89·3 million.

A Seven-Year (1966–1972) Development Programme has been prepared with the help of a team of local and foreign experts headed by Professor Sir Arthur Lewis of Princeton University, U.S.A. A Development Secretariat has also been established.

**Other Development**

Development is also being undertaken by the Commonwealth Development Corporation. The Corporation has concessions for the large-scale development of timber in the area known as the Bartica Triangle, and operates a mill at Houston valued at over £600,000. The Corporation has also furnished capital on medium and short-term loan for the Rice Development Company.

Technical assistance in many fields of development work is being provided by the United States Agency for International Development (formerly the International Co-operation Administration) whose personnel stationed in the Colony include a Chief A.I.D. representative and administrative staff, and who have from time to time provided specialists in Housing, Community Development, Geology, Agriculture, Land Settlement, Drainage and Irrigation, Road Construction, Health and Industrial Development.

Technical assistance for development in various fields has been received also from the United Kingdom, from the Governments of Israel, Puerto Rico, Canada, West Germany and U.S.A. and from the United Nations and its agencies. The scale of United Nations Technical Assistance from 1962 to 1964 has been substantial.

**Education**

There is no standard test for literacy, but using attendance at school for a period of eight years as a criterion for literacy, it is estimated that about 80–85% of the population of British Guiana is literate.

There are 349 primary and all-age schools—Government owned and aided—with a population of 147,839 pupils.

There are 14 Government-aided secondary schools, 13 separate Government-owned secondary schools, and 35 privately owned schools.

**Teacher Training**

The Government Training College for teachers provides (1) in five regional branches, a one-year in-service course (afternoon and evening), for student-teachers drawn from schools in the immediate area of the regional training centre and (2) a full-time two-year pre-service course for candidates from secondary grammar schools.
Scholarships are provided for teachers entering the pre-service training centres. The sum of $50,000 has been provided for this under a Government Scholarship Award Scheme with the assistance of U.N.E.S.C.O. In order to assist in carrying out these programmes graduates have been recruited under the provisions of the British and Canadian Overseas Aid Schemes.

The Government Technical Institute continues to train industrial apprentices though it is centreing its efforts on higher level education rather than craft.

The Carnegie School of Home Economics, run by Government, offers for girls between ages 15-20, a three-year full time course covering cookery, dietetics, dressmaking, tailoring, hygiene, childcare, and homemaking.

The Guyana School of Agriculture, another prospective faculty of the University of Guyana, absorbs students from both the grammar and comprehensive schools. Established in 1963, it provides courses at different levels for farmers, members of Young Farmers Clubs, and for agricultural technicians and teachers.

It offers a two-year Diploma course in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry for which Government, in addition to scholarships, provides students subsistence.

University Education.

Higher education is offered by the University of Guyana set up in 1963 and providing tuition in Arts, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences. Associated with the University are the Research Divisions of the Departments of Geological Survey and Forestry, which will eventually become Research Institutes of the University.

Until construction of the permanent University buildings, towards which a grant of £350,000 ($1,680,000) has been made by the British Government, is completed, courses are being conducted as evening classes at Queens College. There were 268 students on the roll of the University of Guyana at the end of 1964.

Students Studying Overseas.

The number of students from British Guiana studying overseas on the 1st January, 1962, was as follows:

United Kingdom — 948  
Canada — 49  
U.S.A. — 239  
Jamaica, U.W.I. — 153

The total recurrent expenditure on Education in 1964 was £2,393,423. In 1938, the expenditure was £94,290.

Health

During 1964, the sum of £1,416,189 was spent on Public Health and Medical Care. This figure represents 10 per cent of total expenditure of the territory.

At the beginning of 1962 an outbreak of parathion poisoning occurred and in November an epidemic of poliomyelitis commenced and reached its height at the end of the year.

Among the principal causes of death the group "Diseases of early infancy" has the first place, followed by pneumonia and bronchitis, diseases of the heart and gastro-enteritis and colitis. Gastro-enteritis is a very prevalent cause of death of infants one year of age and under.

Prevailing diseases include pulmonary tuberculosis, filariasis due to wuchereria bancrofti, typhoid fever, helminthiasis and minor nutritional disorders attributable mainly to a deficiency in the dietary of B Complex vitamins.

Preventive measures provided by Government consist of activities provided through a Division of Environmental Sanitation, Division of Maternal and Child Health, Public Health Nursing Division, Health Education Division and a Filariasis Unit to combat filariasis.

In 1964 there were 32 Health Centres, 23 of which were established after 1960. There are 116 Maternal and Child Health Units in the rural areas.

There were in 1964, seven general hospitals with 1,407 beds; ten private general hospitals with 490 beds; eight cottage hospitals with 86 beds; one Tuberculosis Hospital with 246 beds; one Leprosy Hospital with 354 beds and one Mental Hospital with 834 beds.

Communications

Government operates one International Airport (Atkinson) and maintains at least twenty other land aerodromes throughout the country. Internal air services are provided by Guyana Airways Corporation (previously known as British Guiana Airways (Govt.)) who are also agents for British West Indian Airways and Cruzeiro-do-Sul. External services making connections with world net-work of air routes are provided by British West Indian Airways, Pan American Airways, the K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines, Air France and Cruzeiro-do-Sul (Brazil).

There are two Government owned railway lines (single track) both parallel to the coast and totalling about 80 miles in length. Passengers carried in 1964 totalled 3,125,510 and freight totalled 52,247 tons.

There were in 1964, about 320 miles of paved roads with bitumin, concrete or asphalt surface, and about 750 miles of roads consisting of sand or clay embankments surfaced with stone, gravel, burnt earth or unsurfaced. In addition there were 1,000 miles of vehicular trails.

The chief ports are Georgetown, New Amsterdam and Springlands with sub-ports at Morawhanna and Kaituma.

The number and tonnage of vessels entered and cleared during 1964 from the principal ports are as follows:

| Entered | Cleared |
|---------|---------|
| No.     | Tons    | No.     | Tons    |
| Georgetown | 1,182 | 2,042,516 | 1,181 | 2,009,876 |
| New Amsterdam | 203 | 256,446 | 107 | 253,089 |
| Kaituma | 54 | 85,191 | 53 | 83,649 |
| Springlands | 486 | 10,818 | 475 | 9,024 |

British Guiana is in direct communication with the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Canada, the U.S.A., the West Indies, Surinam and French Guiana. Services are provided for passengers and cargo principally by Bookers Lines, Harrison Lines, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Alcoa and Saguenay Terminals.
The three main rivers, Demerara, Essequibo and Berbice are navigable by ocean-going vessels of moderate draught for about 65, 35 and 100 miles respectively. There are also numerous other rivers which are navigable in their tidal reaches by smaller vessels. There are many long stretches of water in the upper rivers navigable by launches. Ferry services, coastal and river services are also operated by steamers.

Broadcasting

The commercial broadcasting station, Radio Demerara, operates on short and medium waves with a power of 10,000 watts medium wave, and 2,000 watts short wave; another station—the British Guiana Broadcasting Service—which was officially opened in December 1958 operates a 10 kW transmitter on 560 kc/s (536 metres). There were 39,337 licensed holders of radio receiving sets in 1964.

Principal Occupations

The greater part of the population is engaged in agriculture. Estimates of average employment for the following industries are: Sugar field workers 12,451; Sugar milling 3,583; Bauxite 4,110.

At the end of 1964 there were 54 registered workers' organizations and 6 employers' associations.

The Main Crops and Products are sugar, rum, molasses, rice, bauxite, timber, gold and diamonds. In 1964 production was:

- Sugar: 258,000 tons
- Rum: 3,059,000 proof gals.
- Molasses: 13,858,000 gals.
- Rice (milled): 156,000 tons
- Bauxite: 2,500,000 tons
- Gold: 2,000 billion ozs.
- Diamonds: 107,000 metric carats

Timber production (principally greenheart, mora and crabwood) in 1964 was approximately 6.4 million cubic feet.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 332,000; pigs 65,650; sheep 86,500; goats 32,000; horses, mules and donkeys 8,330; poultry 2,560,000.
