BERMUDA

Situation and Area

The "Bermudas" or "Somers Islands" are situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, about 570 miles east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, and until 1940 had an area of 19·34 square miles. As a result of work done by the United States authorities since 1940 to unite and extend some of the islands with materials dredged from the sea, their total area is now 20·59 square miles, of which 2·30 square miles are leased to the Government of the United States for naval and military bases, leaving 18·29 square miles available to the civil population. The United States Bases include a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

Population

The estimated civil population on the 30th June 1965 was 48,355, of whom 17,452 were white and 30,903 coloured.

Principal Towns

The City of Hamilton, the capital since 1815, with a population estimated at about 3,000, is situated on the main island. The town of St. George on the island of St. George was formerly the capital of the Colony. Its population is estimated at about 1,600.

Geographical Features

The Bermudas consist of about 150 coralstone islands and islets, roughly in the form of a fishhook, along the southern rim of the oval plateau summit, about 22 miles from east to west and 14 miles from north to south, of a steep submarine volcanic mountain which is reputed to be between 14,000 and 15,000 feet in height. The ten principal islands are connected by bridges and form a chain about 22 miles long between its north-east and south-west extremities. These islands vary in width but the main island, which is about 14 miles long, has an average width of about 1 mile; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 259 feet above the sea. All the other islands and the areas reclaimed for the United States Bases aggregate about 4,240 acres.

Climate

The climate is generally mild and humid with a mean annual temperature of 70° F. and average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 88° F. and 47° F. respectively. The coldest and hottest months are February and August with mean temperatures of 62° F. and 80° F. respectively. The average annual rainfall is 57·9 inches. The climate shows very little variation throughout the Colony.

History

According to a 17th century French cartographer the islands were probably discovered in 1503 by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, but the Spaniards took no steps to form a settlement and the islands were still entirely uninhabited when in 1609 Admiral Sir George Somers' ship The Sea Venture was wrecked upon one of the sunken reefs while conveying a party of colonists to Virginia. The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion and this extension was granted by King James I, in 1612 and the first emigrants went out in that year. Shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands", and thenceforward for a considerable time the islands bore that name. In 1684 the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled and government passed to the Crown.

Constitution

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620. Since 1684 the Governors have been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature. Until 1888 this legislature consisted of the Governor and the House of Assembly and since then of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of three official members (Colonial Secretary, Colonial Treasurer and the Attorney General), and six unofficial members (increased from five in November, 1962) appointed by the Crown.

The Legislative Council consists of three official members (The Chief Justice as President, the Colonial Secretary and the Attorney General) and eight nominated members.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members elected for a term of five years. Under the provisions of the Parliamentary Act, 1963 the nine parishes, which had previously been represented by four members, were divided into two electoral districts, each represented by two members. The Act requires that voters must be British Subjects of twenty-five years of age or over at the time of registration, and if not possessing Bermudian status, must have been ordinarily resident in the Colony for the whole of the period of three years immediately prior to registration, registration being held every year. Candidates for election must qualify as electors and, in addition, must possess Bermudian status. Electors who own the freehold estate in land in Bermuda of an area of not less than 2,000 square feet will now qualify for an additional vote. Formerly the franchise had been limited to those persons possessing freehold property of not less than £60 in value and, prior to 1944, only males were permitted to vote or to seek election. The 1963 Act was amended in 1966 by reducing the voting age to 21 years and by abolishing the additional property vote.

At the General Election held on the 16th May 1963 86·5% of the registered electors voted. The Progressive Labour Party, the first political party to emerge in Bermuda, was successful in getting six of its nine candidates elected. In 1964 twenty-four of the remaining members joined together to form the United Bermuda Party.
Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils and of the House of Assembly are paid 24s. for each day's attendance.

A number of Government Departments are controlled by Executive Boards which consist of unofficials appointed by the Governor. The head of the Department acts in an advisory capacity. The chairmen of most of the major Boards are members of the House of Assembly.

Taxation

There is no direct taxation. The revenue of the Colony is mostly raised from Customs duties. The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 16s. on every £100 of real estate and personal property. The corporation of St. George's obtains its revenue in like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100. The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy rates, and under the Liquor Licence Act licensees pay a certain sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

Public Finance

| 1964 | 6,554,063  | 6,384,975      |

In 1964 £4,191,143 of revenue was derived from Customs duties.

The main heads of expenditure were:

- Education: £896,879

Currency

A new coin, the Bermuda Crown, was issued in February 1965. All other coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, Bermuda Government £10, £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £1,799,945 10s. 0d., were in circulation on 31st December 1964.

Development

The total acreage available for agriculture fell again during 1964, due to the continuing increase in population, and by the year's end was 1,020 acres.

The re-afforestation scheme, started in 1949 with the object of replacing the dead Bermuda cedars, continued on a reduced scale with only 4,700 trees being felled and replaced.

The Parks Division, formed in 1956, continued to care for the many small wayside parks bordering public roads, gardens, school playing fields and grounds, Government House Grounds and the Botanical Gardens, in all comprising some 385 acres.

Public Works

The following is a brief summary of work carried out:

Buildings.—The new wing of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital was completed, and it was opened in June 1965.

A ten-year development plan for the Civil Air Terminal was drawn up, and all alterations will now be carried out in compatibility with this plan.

A central site was selected for a new and up-to-date General Post Office, which is to cost an estimated £421,000. Plans and design were approved in June 1965.

Minor improvements were carried out at Government House and at the Local Forces Camp in Warwick, and a number of Government offices were fitted with air-conditioners.

Work continued on the £4,000,000 school building programme.

Aerial Survey.—Checking of the preliminary survey maps began in mid-1964, but receipt of these is proving slower than expected. It is anticipated that the full range of completed maps will not be available before 1967.

Roads.—Widening and resurfacing was carried out. No new roads were constructed.

Bridges.—£21,000 was voted for the repair of Flatts Bridge. The sum includes the raising of the span by 18 inches, and this will enable larger boats to enter Harrington Sound.

Sea Water Distillation Plant.—The plant became fully operative in May 1965 and, in spite of a number of technical setbacks, had produced nearly 6,000,000 gallons of water by the end of the year.

Education

There are no post-secondary schools.

Departmental expenditure on Education was £896,879 and Public Works expenditure £157,247. Total expenditure on Education was £1,054,126 representing 16·5% of the total Government expenditure as compared with 12·8% in 1962.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Bermuda Library, with adult, children's and music departments in Hamilton, was greatly enlarged during 1957 and now accommodates the interesting collection of the Bermuda Historical
Society. It has branches in St. George’s and Somerset and a distribution service to the schools of the Colony.

The Bermuda Government Aquarium with adjoining live zoological collection, which was also considerably enlarged and much improved, has a museum of local natural history and other exhibits. The Bermuda Historical Society has a second museum in St. George containing items of local historical interest.

Health

The level of health in the Colony continued to be high and Government services are chiefly engaged in preventive measures. The Public Health Department is responsible for the inspection of milk and meat, garbage collection and disposal, rat control, mosquito control, etc. It is also responsible for pre-natal and pre-school health services.

The King Edward VII Memorial Hospital is privately run, but receives an annual Government grant-in-aid, amounting in 1965 to £310,000. The Mental Hospital is attended by Government Medical Officers and Health Officers. On the 1st October 1960, a Health Insurance Scheme for Government employees and their dependants was inaugurated. The scheme is compulsory for Government employees and optional for their dependants. Contributions are at the rate of £5 2s. Od. per annum for an officer only, £10 4s. Od. per annum for an officer and one dependant and £15 12s. Od. for an officer and two or more dependants. The Government contributes equal amounts into the fund.

During 1964 total government expenditure on Health Services including the Mental Hospital was £573,293 compared with approximately £176,841 in 1955.

Communications

The air terminal is at Kindley Field, St. George’s Island.

Six airlines, i.e. B.O.A.C.-Cunard, P.A.A., Eastern, Air Canada, Qantas, and Iberia, provide Bermuda with scheduled services to Britain, Spain, Canada, the United States, the Bahamas, the Caribbean and West Indies, Central and South America, the Pacific and Australia. A total of 3,259 flights through the Colony were recorded in 1964.

Direct and indirect seaborne passenger and cargo services are maintained with varying frequency and regularity with all parts of the world and merchant shipping of 34 nations made a total of 820 calls at Bermuda in 1964.

The Colony has 132 miles of tarmac roads with 8½ miles in Hamilton and 48 miles in St. George’s. On the 31st January 1965 there were 21,987 vehicles licensed in the Colony comprising 7,447 private cars, 512 taxis and 85 buses, 1,237 motor trucks, 12,176 auto and auxiliary cycles and 530 miscellaneous vehicles.

There is no railway in Bermuda.

Broadcasting

There are two broadcasting stations, both commercial, one operated by the Bermuda Broadcasting Company Limited, using the call sign Z.B.M., the other operated by Capital Broadcasting Company Limited, using the call sign ZFB.

The first named company was formed in 1943 and started broadcasting in 1946 on 1240 kc/s with a power output of 250 watts. In 1953 a second station, Z.B.M.2 was added to the network and in 1962 power on both stations was increased to 1,000 watts and an F.M. station Z.B.M.-F.M. was inaugurated.

The Company have also operated since January 1958, a television service known as Z.B.M.-T.V.

The latter named company was formed in 1962 and commenced broadcasting the same year with a power output of 1,000 watts. In July 1965 they opened a Television Station (ZFB-TV).

The Colony thus has four radio stations and two television stations. All are commercially financed, and neither radio nor television receiving licences are required.

Principal Occupations

The tourist trade provides employment for a majority of the population. Estimated numbers in some significant occupations are: Hotels/Guest Houses 2,975; commercial 3,700; construction 1,950; agriculture and gardening 670; general labourers (male) 1,650; transport 950; teachers 540.

The approximate 1964 membership of recognised trade unions was as follows:

Amalgamated Bermuda Union of Teachers 444
Bermuda Industrial Union 312
Bermuda Civil Service Association 266
Bermuda Dockworkers Union 166
Bermuda Employers’ Council 68
United Longshoremen of Bermuda Not active
Association of Scientific Workers Not known

The Amalgamated Bermuda Union of Teachers represents the amalgamation of the Bermuda Union of Teachers and the Teachers Association of Bermuda, which took place in March 1964.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are vegetables (including potatoes), bananas and citrus fruits. Easter Lilies are cultivated for bulbs, flower buds and stems. There is considerable milk and egg production.
