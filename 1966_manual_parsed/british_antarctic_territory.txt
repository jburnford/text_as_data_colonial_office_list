BRITISH ANTARCTIC TERRITORY

Area

The British Antarctic Territory was created on the 3rd March 1962 and, with the exception of the island of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, includes the area previously known as the Falkland Islands Dependencies. The Territory lies between 20°–80 degrees of west longitude and south of the 60th parallel of latitude. Within these bounds lie the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands and the Antarctic Peninsula, together with all adjacent islands and the land mass extending to the South Pole.

Population

The British population of the Territory consists solely of male scientists and technicians who man the British Antarctic Survey scientific stations. During the winter of 1965 the total number was 86. In the summer months when relief personnel arrive, together with summer field workers, this figure may almost double.

No exact number of other nationals working in the area is known.

Principal Towns

There are no towns in the Territory. Scientific and field stations are situated on various islands and parts of the mainland.
Geographical Features

The majority of the islands in the Territory are wild and rugged with many glaciers. The Antarctic Peninsula is mountainous, the highest peak being Mount Andrew Jackson (13,700 feet). There is a snow covered plateau which extends along the peninsula, but declines from 7,000 feet in the south to about 4,000 feet in the north. The main continental area is covered by ice and fringed by floating ice shelves generally about 800 feet thick.

Climate

The Territory has a rigorous polar climate.

History

The main island group of the South Shetlands was discovered and taken possession of by Captain W. Smith in 1819, whilst the South Orkney Islands owe their discovery to Captain G. Powell in 1821.

The Antarctic Peninsula was discovered in 1820 by Edward Bransfield, R.N., and taken into the possession of Great Britain by John Biscoe in 1832. The penetration of what is now known as the Weddell Sea and the final discovery of the Continental Land Masses to the South and East of Antarctic Peninsula can be attributed to many great explorers—Cook, Weddell, Ross and Bruce to name but a few. Many of the Islands within the Territory were used as temporary bases for the early sealing and whaling expeditions, but at Deception Island of the South Shetlands Island Group a more permanent and more active whaling station was in operation from 1906 to 1931. During this time a magistrate was in permanent residence for the summer months.

In the 1943-44 season, under the code name of "Operation Tabarin", the first of what are now known as the British Antarctic Survey bases were established at Deception Island and Port Lockroy. Since then the occupation of bases has been continuous and the number so occupied now stands at (6) with a summer operations base at Fossil Bluff; their locations are as follows:

SIGNY ISLAND—South Orkneys 60°43' South 45°36' West.
DECEPTION ISLAND—South Shetlands 62°59' South 60°34' West.
GALINDEZ ISLAND—West Coast of Graham Land 65°15' South 64°16' West.
ARGENTINE ISLANDS—West Coast of Graham Land.
ADELAIDE ISLAND—67°46' South 68°55' West.
FOSSIL BLUFF—King George VI Sound.
HALLEY BAY—Caird Coast 75°31' South 26°36' West.
STONINGTON—68°11' South 67°11' West.

Other bases have been established, but are at present unoccupied; they were known as:
Base A—Port Lockroy, Wiencke Islands, Palmer Archipelago.
Base C—Cape Geddes, Laurie Island, South Orkneys.
Base D—Hope Bay, Trinity Peninsula.
Base G—Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetlands.
Base J—Prospect Point, Graham Coast.
Base N—Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago.
Base O—Danco Coast, Graham Land.
Base V—View Point.
Base W—Detaille Islets, Loubet Coast, Graham Land.
Base Y—Horseshoe Island, Marguerite Bay.

Constitution

The Territory is administered by the High Commissioner resident in Stanley, Falkland Islands (see page 105).

A Court of Appeal was set up on the 1st July 1965 for the purpose of hearing and determining appeals from the courts of the territory.

Land Policy

The policy is guided by the Antarctic Treaty.

Taxation

All British scientists and technicians are taxed under the Falkland Islands Income Tax Ordinance.

Public Finance

For the years 1960-61 (see under Falkland Islands). Until the year ended 30th June 1962 British Antarctic Territory finances were embodied in those of the Falkland Islands Dependencies.

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| 1961-62 | £689,691 (a) £700,023 |
| 1962-63 | £638,347 (a) £656,083 |
| 1963-64 | £723,861 (a) £704,512 |

(a) Includes H.M.G. grants.

In 1964-65 the revised estimate of revenue totalled £39,409. In addition, the sum of £724,572 was expected to be received from Her Majesty's Government as a contribution towards the cost of running the British Antarctic Survey (ex Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey), Antarctic Bases and Ships.

Currency

Currency (when used) is British coinage and Falkland Islands £5 notes, £1 notes and 10s. notes which are interchangeable with sterling on par.

Communications

Communications between the Territory, the Colony of the Falkland Islands and the United Kingdom are maintained by the British Antarctic Survey's Royal Research Ships the 'John Biscoe' and the 'Shackleton' aided by the chartered vessel m.v. 'Kista Dan'. These ships operate only from November to May.

Between these months the Antarctic Bases are relieved, resupplied and restaffed. Radio communication for the passing of scientific and administrative data is linked between Antarctic Bases and the British Antarctic Survey in Stanley, Falkland Islands.

High Commissioners

1962—Sir Edwin Arrowsmith, K.C.M.G.
1964—Sir Cosmo Haskard, K.C.M.G., M.B.E
