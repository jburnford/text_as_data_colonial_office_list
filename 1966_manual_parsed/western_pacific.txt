WESTERN PACIFIC HIGH COMMISSION

(Administrative headquarters: Honiara, British Solomon Islands.)

The office of High Commissioner for the Western Pacific was created by the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877. The High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not administered by Australia, New Zealand, Fiji or any other civilized power. By the Pacific Order in Council of 1893 the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the High Commissioner's jurisdiction also extends to the New Hebrides and the Banks and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate; but a contribution is paid from United Kingdom Funds in respect of expenses of the British Service in the New Hebrides.

The High Court of the Western Pacific was constituted by the Western Pacific (Courts) Order in Council 1961. The Court has jurisdiction in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate and the Gilbert & Ellice Islands Colony, and the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides. The Court is a superior court of record and has all the jurisdiction which is vested in the High Court of Justice in England subject to the provisions of the Order in Council. Appeals from the decisions of the Court are to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

The Court consists of a Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges. The Chief Justice is stationed in the Protectorate, and there is a Puisne Judge stationed in the Colony and in the Anglo-French Condominium.

By Orders in Council of 1952 the High Commissioner's responsibilities in respect of the Kingdom of Tonga and the Island of Pitcairn were transferred to the Governor of Fiji with effect from the 1st April 1952.

The groups at present under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (including the Phoenix and Northern Line Islands groups).
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Central and Southern Line Islands.

Particulars of these are given below.

The posts of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific and the Governor of Fiji, which for many years had been held conjointly, were separated on the retirement of Sir Brian Freeston in 1952; and arrangements were made to transfer the Headquarters of the Western Pacific from Suva, where they had been since the creation of the post of High Commissioner (except in 1880–82 when Sir Arthur Gordon combined the posts of Governor of New Zealand and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific) to Honiara in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The High Commissioner established his headquarters at Honiara on 1st January 1953 and took over responsibility for the direct administration of the Protectorate from the Acting Resident Commissioner on the same date.

BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE

Area

The Protectorate is enclosed within an area of approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,500 square miles are land.
Population

The population was estimated at the end of 1965 to be as follows:

- Melanesians: 130,765
- Polynesians: 5,180
- Micronesians: 1,840
- Europeans: 1,120
- Chinese: 570
- Others: 255

Grand Total: 139,730

Principal Town

Honiara, the capital, is on the island of Guadalcanal and has a population of approximately 6,700. Europeans number approximately 400, Chinese approximately 300.

Geographical Features

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands situated between the parallels of 5° and 12° 30' S., and the meridians of 155° and 170° E. and includes the islands of Guadalcanal, Malaita, San Cristobal, New Georgia, Santa Ysabel, Choiseul, Mono (or Treasury), Shortlands, Vella Lavella, Ranongga, Simbo, Gizo, Rendova, Kolombangara, Russell, Florida, Rennell, and numerous small islands (Lord Howe Group or Ontong Java, the Santa Cruz Islands, Vanikoro, Tikopia, Mitre Island and the Duff and Reef Groups, etc.).

Climate

The seasons are generally well defined by trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the minimum temperatures are recorded. The highest mean and maximum temperatures and the highest rainfall are, as a rule, recorded in the north-west season from November to April.

History

The Solomon Islands were discovered in 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. Tasman discovered the Ontong Java group in 1643, and in 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz group and the north-west coastline of the island of Malaita. From this time many Europeans visited the group and British ships of war paid periodical visits.

Between 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the proclamation in 1893 of the British protectorate over the southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristobal, the New Georgia group and its dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50. In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz group, including Utupua, Tikopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona were added to the Protectorate. In 1900 the northern islands (Santa Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Shortland group and the atoll group of Ontong Java) were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

In 1942 Japanese troops invaded the islands. Most of the non-native population had been evacuated to Australia but the Resident Commissioner and a number of his officers remained to continue the Administration as far as possible. The Japanese occupied the central Solomons and were driven back by the Allies only after violent air, sea and land battles in 1942 and 1943; they were not completely dislodged from the north-western extremity of the Protectorate until the surrender of Japan. The effect upon the population of contact with the very large numbers of Allied servicemen in occupation of the islands and based there for operations further afield, was great and disruption of native life was inevitable.

An outstanding feature of the war and the enemy invasion of the territory was the great loyalty of the Islanders to their British connexion and to the Allied cause generally.

Constitution

On 18th October 1960 a Constitution which provided for the establishment of a Legislative Council and an Executive Council was brought into operation under the British Solomon Islands (Constitution) Order in Council, 1960.

The Legislative Council is ordinarily presided over by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific as President.

The 1960 Constitution provided for three ex officio members, not more than eight Official Members and not more than ten Unofficial Members. The Official and Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council were appointed by the High Commissioner in his discretion.

Proposals for the election of a majority of the Unofficial Members were put forward by the Council during 1964 and on 4th November 1964, the first stage of a revised Constitution, embodied in the British Solomon Islands Order in Council, 1964, was brought into operation. This Constitution provides for three ex officio members; eight official members; eight elected members; and two nominated (unofficial) members. In seven constituencies the members are elected through an electoral college composed of elected members of the Local Councils in the area; in Honiara election is direct.

Elections for the eight unofficial seats were held on 7th April 1965 and the first meeting of the new Legislative Council opened on 2nd June 1965.

The Executive Council consists of three ex officio members, who are the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary, and such official and unofficial members as the High Commissioner shall appoint.

Legislation is ordinarily made by the High Commissioner with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council.

Land Policy

A Land and Titles Ordinance was enacted and brought into force early in 1963. It provides a system of guaranteed title to land but continues to restrict the alienation to non-natives of land held under systems of native customary tenure and permits the owners of such land, if they so wish, to obtain registered title to their land. The Ordinance provides for vacant land, after adjudi-
cation if vacancy is contested, to be acquired and vested in a Land Trust Board.

Difficulties were experienced in bringing the Ordinance into operation and as a result of the passing of two amending Ordinances, in December 1964 and June 1965 the procedure for the creation of estates from native customary land has been completely replaced, the registration of titles procedure abolished and a system of land registration introduced, and the Land Trust Board has been abolished. Provision has thereby been made for a systematic settlement process in which those interests which are capable of registration under the Ordinance will be recorded for registration.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on chargeable income on a sliding scale, rising from 8c. per $2 on the first $400 to $1·50 per $2 on income over $20,000. No super tax is payable. Companies pay 15c. per $2 on chargeable income.

Local authority rates, payable by all residents on a per capita basis, vary from $1 to $10 per annum, according to area.

Customs duties represent the chief source of revenue from indirect taxation.

Public Finance

| Revenue (excluding grant-in-aid) | Expenditure |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| £A                               | £A          |
| 1961                             | 1,162,514   | 1,702,665   |
| 1962                             | 1,423,875   | 1,993,953   |
| 1963                             | 1,784,511   | 2,238,420   |
| 1964                             | 1,832,515   | 2,544,698   |
| 1965 (estimated)                 | 2,367,410   | 2,976,111   |

In 1965 £A784,500 (est.) of ordinary revenue was derived from Customs duty and £A95,000 (est.) from direct taxation. In the same year, the main heads of ordinary expenditure were:

| £A |
|-----|
| Agriculture | 105,580 |
| Education   | 99,029  |
| Marine      | 207,900 |
| Medical     | 183,802 |
| Works Extraordinary | 220,000 |
| Development | 860,520 |

There is a public debt of £A37,500. Provision is made for a grant by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the Administration, which in 1965 was estimated at £A608,700.

Currency

The currency is Australian. This is interchangeable with sterling at £Stg.1 = Australian $2·50 with effect from 14th February 1966.

Development Plan

The Development Plan 1963–66 is designed to develop the natural and human resources of the Protectorate with the object of strengthening its economy to enable the standards of living of all sections of the community to be raised and in addition to raise the general standard of education. Total expenditure of £A3,015,000 is envisaged of which two-thirds is being financed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The amounts allocated to the various services are as follows:

| %    | £A       |
|------|----------|
| Natural Resources | 45·3 | 1,366,000 |
| Communications     | 9·2  | 278,000   |
| Social Services    | 40·4 | 1,217,000 |
| Miscellaneous      | 5·1  | 154,000   |

Particular emphasis is being placed on the diversification of the economy by the development of the country's forestry resources, the establishment of cocoa as a second cash crop and the execution of an airborne geophysical survey of the mineral resources. The main expenditure on social services is on the malaria eradication pilot project which covers one third of the population and on the Education Plan which is aimed at raising the level of primary education.

Education

Education at the primary level is mainly in the hands of the Churches. In 1963 the Legislative Council adopted an Education Plan which aims to produce an adequate flow of suitably educated pupils for secondary education, by giving maximum support to a limited number of junior and senior primary schools, to be known as designated schools. In 1964 subsidies to Church Schools, largely salary subsidies for qualified teachers, totalled £A33,430. In 1964 there were four Government primary schools and one Government secondary boarding school, taking pupils to Cambridge Overseas G.C.E. level; in 1964 four boys gained Cambridge Overseas School Certificates. There were 575 pupils in these schools. In addition there were 397 registered Church and Local Authority Schools, with about 20,200 pupils. Since 1959 two-year courses for teachers in junior primary schools (Standards I–IV) have been provided at the British Solomons Training College; the annual intake was 24, but in 1964 extensions to the Training College were completed to enable women students to be residential, and the annual intake to be increased to 30. The Roman Catholic teacher training institute at Villa Maria is recognised by Government for the training of women teachers; in 1964 23 women were enrolled.

Expenditure in education during 1964 was:

| £A |
|-----|
| By churches | 190,774 |
| By Government (from Protectorate Funds) | 44,300 |
| From Colonial Development and Welfare Funds | 127,344 |

Libraries and Museums

There is a small museum in Honiara. A library is maintained by an independent club of subscribers.

Health

The principal endemic diseases are malaria, tuberculosis, hookworm and leprosy.

Apart from the Central Hospital in Honiara, which has accommodation for 140 patients, and the Government Leprosarium at Tetere (100 patients), district hospitals are situated at Auki, Gizo and Kira Kira, and rural hospitals at Malu'u and Tetaba, Santa Ysabel. Seventeen Rural Health units (combined health clinics and maternity and child health centres) were completed or under construction; there are also 61 health clinics and 30 maternity and child health centres.

The various Church authorities also contribute largely to health matters in the Protectorate, there being two Mission Hospitals, each in charge of a Medical Officer, situated at Munda and Fauabu.

Yaws has virtually disappeared from large parts of the Protectorate, since the W.H.O./U.N.I.C.E.F. assisted campaign in 1958, which reduced the
incidence of the disease from 14.7% to 0.29%. An intensive effort was made towards the end of 1962 to deal with residual pockets of infectious yaws in N.E. Malaita. A mass re-survey of the infected areas treated 26 cases found in 15,300 people and at the end of 1963 a further re-survey showed a drop to 0.26% incidence. A further mass survey is planned for Malaita in 1966.

A sister tutor is running courses at the Central Hospital to train Solomon Island nurses, under the auspices of the World Health Organisation. A public health tutor was recruited under similar auspices in October, 1965 to undertake in service training for nurses and medical assistants in the districts.

A malaria eradication pilot project began in October 1961 with the arrival of the W.H.O. project leader, and intensive training of local staff as technicians and squad leaders. Following a geographical reconnaissance of the selected area, Guadalcanal and New Georgia, spraying operations began in October 1962 and the fourth and final round of spraying was begun in June 1964. Following the successful interruption of the transmission of malaria in the pilot project area a pre-eradication project was launched at the beginning of 1965 to provide for the gradual build-up of the technical, administrative and operational facilities required for the launching of a Protectorate wide malaria eradication programme.

The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1964 was £A255,872.

Communications

The aerodromes used by international air services are at Honiara (Henderson Field) on Guadalcanal, Yandina in the Russell Islands and Munda on New Georgia. In addition there are domestic aerodromes at Barakoma, Vella Lavella, Auki (Gwaunaru'u) on Malaita and at Kira Kira in San Cristobal. Aerodromes are under construction at Sege in New Georgia and Mono (Stirling) in the Treasury Islands, and at Avu Avu on Guadalcanal.

International air services are provided by a weekly service between Honiara and Lae, New Guinea, operated by Trans Australia Airlines, on behalf of Qantas Empire Airways, and by a weekly service of three flights between Suva, Fiji and Honiara by way of Santo and Vila in the New Hebrides and Nadi in Fiji, operated by Fiji Airways. Domestic air services are operated by a local airline Megapode Airways and, between Munda, Yandina and Honiara, by Trans Australia Airlines as part of its international route.

The Posts and Telecommunications Department provides the following public commercial services:

(i) Postal air and surface letter, packet and parcel service to all parts of the world and within the Protectorate;

(ii) Direct telegraph and radiotelephone links between Honiara—Sydney, Honiara—Vila and Honiara—Suva and, through these centres and the Compac cable, communications with most countries of the world;

(iii) Direct telegraph communication with Tarawa in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony;

(iv) Internal telegraph and radio-telephone communications with the District stations and, through these, with other centres; and

(v) Telegraph communication with ships at sea, through the Honiara coastal station.

The department also operates and maintains the aeronautical telecommunications services and a shipping guard for local and foreign going ships.

There are 66 miles of motorable road with a rolled coral surface and permanent bridges on Guadalcanal and several miles of motorable tracks which are all being extended. There is a network of roads around the airfield at Munda on New Georgia and Barakoma on Vella Lavella. There are 3 miles of road on Gizo Island and 22 on Malaita which are being extended.

Messrs. Burns Philp and Company, Ltd., operate a freight and passenger service to the Protectorate via the New Hebrides from Sydney at intervals of approximately six weeks; the Australia-New Guinea Line operates a similar service direct from Australian ports. The Australian West Pacific Line and the China Navigation Company operate a freighter service between Hong Kong and Sydney calling at Honiara quarterly on the southward journey only. The Rotterdam Lloyd Line and the Bank Line also operate regular monthly services from the United Kingdom and the Continent. Bank Line vessels also call at intervals of six weeks to load copra. Since 1962 petroleum products have been shipped in large tankers and stored at Honiara.

The chief ports in the Protectorate are Honiara at which a deep water berth is in course of construction, Yandina and Gizo. The Government owns and operates 33 small vessels for inter-island communications and administrative and medical touring, and one small fishing vessel. There is a considerable number of privately owned vessels in the Protectorate.

Broadcasting

The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Service (callsign VQO, VQO-3 and VQO-4) transmits daily from 07.30 to 11.15 hours GMT on weekdays and from 09.00 to 11.15 hours GMT on Saturdays and Sundays. There is a forty-five minute broadcast for schools each Monday morning and this service is being expanded.

Principal Occupations

Most of the indigenous population is engaged in agriculture, either in village gardens or in the copra industry. They are under no economic necessity to work for wages. In 1964 the total number employed was estimated at 9,000 of whom 3,000 were employed on agricultural estates.

The first trade union in the Protectorate, the British Solomon Islands Workers' Union, was registered in 1961, and has approximately 4,200 members; a second, registered in 1963, has 650.

Main Crops and Products

The principal crop grown for export is coconuts; cocoa is also developing being planted by both Solomon Islanders and Europeans. Crops grown for local consumption include yams, sweet potatoes, taro and other roots, canarium almonds, cassava, rice, groundnuts, maize, bananas, pineapples and market garden vegetables.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is 10,000 pigs, 4,500 cattle, 300 goats and 100 horses.

Although two timber companies suspended operations in 1965, there are still three companies engaged on operations to export timber. The market is not at present strong and exports in 1965 have fallen below expectation. Production should, however, increase rapidly in the next few years.
Trade

The chief export is copra which is mainly shipped to the United Kingdom. Total exports of copra in 1960 were 19,460 tons valued at £A1,562,818; in 1961, 24,276 tons valued at £A1,568,792; in 1962, 22,400 tons valued at £A1,411,637; in 1963, 23,092 tons valued at £A1,668,935; in 1964, 23,431 tons valued at £A1,762,168.

(Including bullion and specie.)

Imports consist of foodstuffs and a wide range of manufactured goods 50% of which come from Australia and 20% from Great Britain.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate Copra Board, which has agents at the main ports, purchases all copra from producers and sells it overseas. A small staff exists under a Registrar of Co-operative Societies to introduce the Solomon Islander to co-operative methods for economic development. The first co-operative society was formed in 1957 and at the end of 1964 there were 72 primary societies and three secondary organizations. Most are at present concerned with the marketing of copra and the distribution of consumer goods.

THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN LINE ISLANDS

These consist of Flint, Caroline, Vostock, Malden and Starbuck, and are administered direct by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, formerly under Article 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, and more recently in accordance with instructions issued by the Secretary of State in 1903, under Article 4 of the Order in Council.

Flint Island was discovered in 1801 but continued search has failed to elicit the name or nationality of the discoverer. Since 1872 it has been worked for guano and copra, with interruptions, by various British companies under licence issued by the High Commissioner.
Caroline Island was discovered in 1705 by Captain W. R. Broughton of H.M. Sloop Providence and it has been worked by various British companies since 1846.

Vostock Island was discovered by Captain Bellingshausen, the Russian explorer, during his expedition to the South Pacific and Antarctic in 1820 and has been worked sporadically by British companies for guano and copra since 1873. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Malden Island was discovered by Lord Byron, Captain of H.M.S. Blonde, in 1825, after conveying the remains of the King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands back to Honolulu from England for burial. Its guano deposits were worked by an Australian company from approximately 1860 to 1927. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Starbuck Island was discovered in 1823 by Captain Starbuck, of the whaler L'Aigle owned by a London company. It was first worked for guano by a British company during the eighteen-sixties. Attempts to plant coconuts on the island failed and since 1920 it has been unoccupied and unworked.

‡ Excluding U.S. nationals.

§ Excluding service personnel.

Geographical Features

With the exception of Ocean Island (which is a coral reef raised by volcanic action some 200 feet above its original level) the islands are all of coral formation, some with lagoons and some without. There are 16 such islands in the Gilbert group, 9 in the Ellice group, 8 in the Phoenix group, and 3 in the northern Line Islands.

Climate

The driest months are August to October and the wettest December to February, when northeasterly and westerly storms occur. The southern Gilberts, Phoenix and Christmas Island (Line) suffer from periodic droughts which have an approximate cycle of seven years. Rainfall varies from 100 inches annually in the northern Gilberts through 40 inches in the southern up to 120 inches in the Ellice Islands. In the Phoenix Islands the average rainfall is about 50 inches but annual rainfall varies considerably and a severe drought in 1962 and 1963 killed many of the coconut trees and required the evacuation of the populations of the islands of Hull and Gardner. In the Line Islands it averages from 30 inches on Christmas Island up to 150 on Washington. The day temperature varies between 80° and 90° throughout the year and the minimum night temperature is about 70°. The trade winds keep the air cool and humidity is not high, except during the rainy season.

History

It is thought that two of the Gilbert Islands and two of the Ellice Islands were sighted by 16th century Spanish navigators. The discovery of the remaining islands had to await the arrival of trading vessels and whalers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Gilbert and Ellice groups were brought under the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in 1877 and a Protectorate was established in 1892 when H.M.S. Royalist visited them. Ocean Island was annexed in 1900, and in 1915 the Gilbert and Ellice Islands were annexed by an Order in Council of 10th November. The Order came into effect on 12th January 1916 from which date the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate became a Colony. In the same year the boundaries of the Colony were extended to include Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands; in 1919 Christmas Island; and in 1937 the Phoenix Islands.

Constitution and Administration

The Resident Commissioner is advised by an Advisory Council established by Ordinance enacted by the High Commissioner during 1963. The Advisory Council consists of the Resident Commissioner as President, the Assistant Resident Commissioner as ex-officio Member, not more than four Official Members, not less than eight and not more than twelve Unofficial Members.
The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Order in Council 1963 provided for an Executive Council consisting of the Assistant Resident Commissioner as ex-officio Member, not more than three Official Members and not more than four Unofficial Members. The Order in Council was brought into force by Proclamation on 1st January 1964.

Local governments are established on islands in the Gilbert and Ellice groups. They are supervised by District Commissioners responsible through the Resident Commissioner to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. These governments, under a constitution introduced in 1941 and amended in 1955, consist of a representative Council with an unofficial majority which exercises minor legislative and executive authority; a Court with criminal and civil jurisdiction over persons of pure and mixed Pacific Islands extraction; and a Lands Court which operates customary law under a Native Lands Ordinance. Since 1958 Island Councils have been able to make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure. Because of the scattered nature of the territory, the local governments have considerable freedom from direct supervision.

The Western Pacific (Courts) Order in Council, 1961 which was brought into operation in the Colony by Proclamation on the 18th April, 1962, provided for the continuation and reconstitution of the High Commissioner's Court as the High Court of the Western Pacific, a Superior Court of Record with jurisdiction similar to that of the High Court of Justice in England.

Legislation which came into force on the 18th October, 1961, made further alterations to the Colony's judicial structure by constituting throughout the Colony new Courts of summary jurisdiction, known as Magistrates' Courts. By an Order under section 26 of the Western Pacific (Courts) Order in Council, 1961, the High Commissioner ended (with one minor exception) the judicial powers and functions of persons appointed as Deputy Commissioners under the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. That order and the legislation establishing Magistrates' Courts came into operation simultaneously.

Land Policy

The alienation of land to non-natives is forbidden and leases may not be taken out without the consent of the Resident Commissioner or, if the lease is to be for a period in excess of 99 years or for an area exceeding five acres, without the approval of the High Commissioner. Very little land is owned by non-natives (acquired before annexation) or by the Crown.

£1 Sterling = Australian $2·50
£1 New Zealand = Australian $2·50
£1 Fiji = Australian $2·25

Development Plans

Colonial Development and Welfare Funds totalling £A330,294 have been made available for the 1964/66 Development Plan. The plan provides for expenditure as follows:

| Item                  | (£A)   | %    |
|-----------------------|--------|------|
| Communications        | 36,000 | 9·10 |

| (b) Medical           | 60,487 | 15·28|
| Miscellaneous         | 57,130 | 14·43|

£A394,897

Of this total, £A328,147 will be provided from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds; £A36,460 from Colony Funds and £A30,290 from the Overseas Service Aid Scheme and the Colony Copra Board.
Education

At 31st December 1964, there were 11,659 children between the ages of 6 and 16 receiving primary education. Twenty-seven primary schools are maintained from Colony and local Government funds and 222 are grant-aided. At Tarawa the Government maintains secondary boarding schools for boys and girls with 177 pupils proceeding to higher education. Sixteen students were attending secondary schools in Australia and New Zealand on scholarships, and one was attending the University of Queensland, Australia. Forty-two students were taking technical training and professional courses in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, Fiji, and Australia, funds being provided partly by Government grants and partly from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. Locally 24 students were being trained as teachers under a Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme. Government expenditure on Education in 1964 was £A66,053 compared with £A49,412 in 1963, and £A3,849 in 1935–36.

Health

There is a small hospital on every island with a Dresser in charge. Assistant Medical Officers are stationed at the larger islands. Two General Hospitals provide 279 beds and there is a Cottage Hospital with 16 beds.

Tuberculosis and dysentery are the commonest diseases in the Colony. Leprosy also occurs and there is a small leprosarium at Tarawa. Very few cases of yaws have been observed since the mass campaign against this disease in 1957.

The total expenditure on Health Services excluding building and maintenance of buildings and overseas training in 1964 was £A85,148 compared with £A8,848 in 1935–36.

Communications

There is an international airport at Canton Island, the use of which has greatly declined with the advent of fan-jet aircraft. The landing field at Tarawa was improved, and the former airfield at Funafuti rehabilitated to permit the inauguration, during 1964, of a commercial air service between Fiji and Tarawa now providing a weekly service. Flying-boats occasionally visit Tarawa and can land at several other lagoon islands.

Communications in the Colony are mainly marine; the Colony Government operates two and the Missions operate three small inter-island vessels and the Wholesale Society and various Co-operative Societies two more. Communications overseas: shipping services between Britain and Tarawa (via Panama) and Australia and Tarawa have recently been introduced; each month several vessels owned or chartered by the British Phosphate Commissioners arrive at Ocean Island from, or leave for, Australia or New Zealand. At irregular intervals one of the inter-island vessels visits Fiji and two or three times a year a ship arrives from Fiji en route for Britain to load copra at Tarawa and in the Line Islands.

The Government operates 33 radio transmitting and receiving stations with a headquarters station at Tarawa to pass traffic to and from the Colony network, and a VHF network of three stations at Tarawa. Telegraphic wireless contact is direct with Suva, Nandi, Honiara and Nauru. Contact is also maintained with shipping inside and outside the Colony.

Broadcasting

Government broadcasts in the Gilbertese and Ellice languages have been transmitted since February 1954 on a frequency of 6,050 kc/s power 2 kW. In 1961 a new transmitter purchased as part of a Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme came into operation. It transmits programmes in the Gilbertese and Ellice vernaculars five times a week on frequencies in the medium and shortwave bands. In addition there is a once weekly English language broadcast on the same frequencies.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in copra production on a subsistence basis. Estimated numbers in other occupations are: Government service 1,271, including 352 part-time Native (Local) Government officials; phosphate mining 1,409; commerce 533.

Main Crops and Products

Apart from copra production there is no other crop of commercial value. Sea fishing is excellent but on a small scale. Phosphate of lime is mined at Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners.

Trade

| Year | Total Imports |
|------|--------------|
| 1960 | £A 1,022,096 |
| 1961 | £A 1,384,480 |
| 1962 | £A 1,530,284 |
| 1963 | £A 1,416,092 |
| 1964 | £A 1,623,868 |

In 1939 42% of total imports came from Australia and New Zealand, 35% from other Commonwealth countries and 23% from elsewhere. In 1964 the corresponding figures were 73%, 16% and 11%.

The principal imports are cotton goods, fuel oils, soap, tobacco, building materials and food-stuffs (rice, flour, sugar and tinned meat).

Principal Exports by Quantity and Value

| Year | Copra (£A) | Phosphate (untreated) (£A) |
|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1938-39 | 70,717 | 208,521 |
| 1963 | 460,512 | 915,610 |
| 1964 | 387,666 | 805,474 |

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Copra Board is responsible for all purchases of copra in the Colony and sales overseas. Internal purchases are made through the agency of the Wholesale Society, a statutory organization, and Co-operative Societies. Most imports and sales of retail goods are handled by this Wholesale Society and Co-operatives, which are represented on the Board of Directors of the Wholesale Society. At 31st March 1964 there were 45 co-operative societies (mainly consumer-marketing societies, but including six consumer societies and four unions) having a total membership of 17,978. The volume of private trading in the Colony is small.

THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONDOMINIUM OF THE NEW HEBRIDES

Area

The area, including the Banks and Torres Islands, is estimated at 5,700 square miles.

The largest islands are Santo and Malekula, the former with an area of approximately 1,500 square miles. Other large islands are Efate, Ambrym, Tanna, Erromanga, Epi, Aoba, Pentecost and Maewo; and, in the Banks Group, Gaua and Vanua Lava. There are also some 60 small islands and islets.

Population

The indigenous population was estimated at the end of 1964 to be about 65,800. This total is based on figures provided by the Anti-Yaws Campaign carried out in 1959 to 1960 and takes account of an estimated annual rate of increase of about 2½% overall. The non-indigenous population, composed of British subjects and French citizens together with persons placed under the jurisdiction of one or other Power, was estimated in 1964 at approximately 4,500, representing a sharp decrease following the departure of nearly 2,000 Tonkinese, repatriated voluntarily to North Vietnam. At the end of 1964 there were a total of 1,068 British subjects and British ressortissants.

Principal Towns

The Administrative Headquarters of the Group is in Vila, a town of approximately 4,500 inhabitants, on the island of Efate, which has a population of approximately 5,000. In recent years a second township, known as Santo, or Luganville, with a population of about 3,500, has grown up along the Segond Channel on the island of Santo.

Geographical Features

The islands are of coral and volcanic formation, with active volcanoes on Tanna, Lopevi and Ambrym. They are almost without exception mountainous, Santo Peak and Tabwebesana on Santo rising to over 6,000 feet, but narrow, cultivable coastal strips are generally present. The group is generally well watered. On the larger islands are several small navigable rivers. There are four good harbours, Vila and Havannah on Efate and Ports Sandwich and Stanley on Malekula.

Climate

The climate is oceanic and moderated by the south-east trade winds which blow between the months of May and October. During the remainder of the year winds are variable and cyclones may occur. High humidity occasionally leads to enervating conditions. Temperatures at Vila vary between 60° and 92° and average rainfall ranges from about 45 inches in the south to about 250 inches in the north, with a mean figure of 81 inches for Vila.

History and Constitution

The New Hebrides were discovered by the Spanish explorer, de Quiros in 1606. The next mention came from the French navigator Bougainville in 1768, and in 1774 Captain Cook visited and charted the greater part of the chain of islands comprising the group. Other early visitors were La Perouse, who is believed to have passed through in 1788, and D'Entrecasteaux who came in search of La Perouse in 1793. In this same year the sighting of the Banks Islands was recorded by Captain Bligh in the course of his open boat voyage to Timor after the mutiny on the Bounty. Last century, before any national eyes were turned on the New Hebrides, a number of British and French missionaries, planters and traders had established themselves, and in 1887, by the Anglo-French Convention of 16th November, the two nations appointed a Joint Naval Commission charged with the protection in the New Hebrides of the lives and properties of the subjects of England and France.

In 1902 Deputy Resident Commissioners were appointed and took up residence in the Territory, and in February 1906 an Anglo-French conference took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for settlement of land claims and for an arrangement to end the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. This was confirmed on 20th October 1906 and established an Anglo-French condominium.

A Protocol, drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified in 1922.

There are three Administrations—the British National, the French National and the Condominium (or joint) Administrations.

An Advisory Council was established by Joint Regulation in 1957 and it is now comprised of four official members, one each from the British and French Administrations and two Condominium Heads of Department; 20 unofficial
members—10 New Hebridean, five British and five French—of whom eight are elected, four by the Chamber of Commerce and four by local Councils. The two Resident Commissioners are co-Presidents.

Land Policy

As the New Hebrides is not a territorial possession of either power concerned, there are no Crown lands or their equivalent. The whole of the land area of the group is held to belong, or to have belonged until alienated, to the natives. The Protocol regulates the acquisition of unregistered land from natives, and the registration of land claims. It provides for the creation of inalienable native reserves, and for the control of sales of land by natives to non-natives.

Taxation

The main forms of taxation are import duties (17½% ad valorem, with certain exceptions) and duties from 2% to 6% on exports of copra, cocoa, coffee, shell, etc. There is no income tax.

Condominium revenue and expenditure (excluding entirely revenue and expenditure of the British and French National Services) is shown in the following table:

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1960 | 592,409*    | 592,409         |
| 1961 | 593,236*    | 593,236         |
| 1962 | 679,648     | 646,864         |
| 1963 | 698,549     | 684,354         |
| 1964 | 834,798*    | 834,798         |

* Includes £44,417 appropriated from reserves to meet hurricane rehabilitation expenses in 1960. Figures for 1961 include £38,809 appropriated from reserves. The figure for 1964 includes £26,171 appropriated from reserves.

The main sources of revenue in 1964 were Import and Export duties £549,118. The main heads of expenditure in 1964 were Public Works £185,417, Local Development Plan £70,890 and Medical £65,774.

Currency

The Anglo-French Protocol of 1914 provides that currency and banknotes of either power shall be legal tender in the Group. The currencies in use are the Australian dollar and the New Hebrides franc which has the same rate of exchange as the Pacific franc but is convertible into sterling at the rate of Frs 200 = Australian $2·00. Sterling values are used throughout this chapter.

Development

The more important of the current development projects partly or entirely financed from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds include:

**Medical**
- Improvement of British Mission Hospital.
- Training of Medical Staff.
- Construction of island clinics.

**Education**
- Construction of a British Secondary School.
- Overseas Scholarships.
- Operation of British Teacher Training College.

**Communications**
- Construction of Local Airfields.
- Development of Vila and Santo Radio Stations.
- Construction of Roads and Bridges.

**Trade**
- Employment of Co-operative Societies Officer.

**Agriculture**
- Construction of an Agricultural Training School.
- Expansion of the Condominium Agricultural Department.

**Basic Surveys and Mapping**
- Geological Survey.
- Tellurometer Survey.

Expenditure from C.D. & W. Funds during the period April 1964 to March 1966 is estimated to reach £511,808. Through the FIDES programme the French Government shares in the financing of "Joint" Development Projects (e.g. Communications and Agriculture) and, like the British Government, devotes substantial sums to projects operated on a "national" basis, mainly in the fields of health and education.

**Education**

Education is not a joint Condominium Service, but the separate responsibility of the two national administrations. In addition to funds from metropolitan government sources, each administration receives from the Condominium budget half of an annual subvention which, in 1964, totalled £38,000. The French administration operates schools at Vila, Santo, Tanna, Aoba, Malekula, Tongoa, Futuna and Erromanga, and assistance is given to French mission schools. All French schools are at the primary level except at Vila and Santo, where secondary classes have been established. On the British side, primary education is provided by schools of Church voluntary agencies, which are situated on most islands in the Group, and are assisted by grant-in-aid and inspected by Education Officers.

There is a multi-racial administration school at Vila and another for children of New Hebridean police officers. At Santo the multi-racial independent school, built under a C.D. & W. scheme, is subsidized by the British Government. Recent developments include the formation of a British Education Advisory Committee, members of which include representatives of the voluntary agencies and the public, and the establishment of a central Teacher Training College near Vila for the training of primary teachers. The College, which opened in 1962, was built and equipped under a C.D. & W. scheme, and has an output of up to 36 trained teachers annually.

At present, scholarships are provided for secondary education overseas and for vocational training but a residential co-education Secondary School, to be built near Vila, is planned to be opened in April 1966 with an annual intake of 30 students.

**Libraries and Museums**

The Vila Cultural Centre, which receives a subvention from the Joint Administration, operates a free public lending library and reading room. There is also a small public library at Santo. The Vila Cultural Centre has established a small museum which has collections of native artifacts and natural history specimens.

**Health**

Malaria is the most serious endemic disease. Tuberculosis is an important cause of death and hookworm infections and anaemia are common
causes of debility. A successful campaign against yaws was carried out in 1959 and 1960. At present the World Health Organisation is assisting Condominium with a tuberculosis control project.

The French Government maintains hospitals at Vila and Santo and medical centres at Malekula and Tanna staffed by French army doctors. The British Government maintains a rural clinic in the Banks Islands and another on Pentecost staffed by Assistant Medical Officers and several others staffed by Medical Assistants. It also subsidises British Mission Hospitals at Aoba, Vila and Tanna. In addition the British Missions maintain with British Government financial assistance a large number of rural clinics staffed by locally trained dressers and nurses. The Joint Administration Medical Subsidy is shared between the French and British Medical Services.

There is a rudimentary Condominium Medical Service which is staffed by British and French Government Medical Officers on a part-time basis and two whole-time Assistant Medical Officers together with some dressers. This service is mainly concerned with public health and preventive medicine. A conference of British and French medical personnel including mission medical staff was held in 1964 when recommendations for the strengthening of the Condominium medical services were discussed.

Communications

Fiji Airways Ltd. operates a service twice a week to Suva, Nandi, Vila, Santo, Honiara and return to Fiji, where regular services to Australia, New Zealand, U.S.A., and the U.K. are provided by QANTAS and TEAL. The French company, Union de Transports Aériens, provides a twice-weekly air service to and from New Caledonia where there are regular services to Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, U.S.A. and France. There are two internal airlines, New Hebrides Airways Limited and Hebridair, which operate both regular and charter services throughout the Group. Flying boat facilities exist at both Vila and Santo though no regular commercial service is now operated.

The Public Works Department maintains limited roads on Efate, Santo, Tanna and Malekula. There are, in addition, tracks usable by motor vehicles on some of the other islands.

Passenger shipping services link the New Hebrides with Australia, New Caledonia, France (via Panama Canal), and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. Small vessels give a frequent but non-scheduled inter-island service.

There is direct telegraphic communication by wireless contact with Honiara (B.S.I.P.), Noumea (New Caledonia), Suva (Fiji) and Sydney. There is an internal network of private and commercial teleradio stations and air-radio facilities are provided. Radio-telephone services operate between Vila and in some cases Santo and Honiara, Noumea, Suva and Sydney from where the service can be extended to U.S.A., Europe, etc.

There is no broadcasting service.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is employed on plantations and in trading or subsistence agriculture. A manganese mine at Forari on Eastern Efate employs about 200 persons. An agricultural trade union was established in 1964.

Main Crops and Products

The most important cash crops are copra, cocoa and coffee. The principal subsistence crops are yam, taro, manioc, sweet potato and breadfruit. Large numbers of cattle are kept on plantations and efforts are being made to develop the local meat industry both for export and home consumption. Manganese is mined in opencast workings at Forari on the east coast of Efate by the Société Francaise des Phosphates de l'Oceanie and is mainly exported to Japan. In 1964 a first consignment of ore was exported to Australia.

There is little fishing for the local market although considerable subsistence fishing is done. At Santo the South Pacific Fishing Company, a British concern, operates a plant where tuna and bonito are frozen and prepared for export to the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The fish are caught by Korean and Japanese long-line trawlers working in association with S.P.F.C. Small amounts of timber are felled and milled for local use on Anetiyum and Efate and in 1965 a French concern was investigating the possibility of working large stands of kauri on Erromango.

REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

THE WEST INDIES

INTERIM COMMISSIONER FOR THE WEST INDIES

The Federation of The West Indies which came into being in January 1958 comprised the Territories of Barbados; Jamaica (including the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands); the Leeward Islands of Antigua, Montserrat, and St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla; Trinidad and Tobago; and the Windward Islands of Grenada, Dominica, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. (It did not include British Guiana, British Honduras nor the Virgin Islands.)

On 6th February 1962 in an announcement in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State referred to the decision of Jamaica to withdraw from the Federation and Her Majesty's Government's acceptance of this decision; the decision of Trinidad and Tobago not to participate in any federation of the Eastern Caribbean; and the fact that the Premier of Barbados and the Chief Ministers of the Leeward and Windward Islands, while advocating a new federation between their territories, were agreed that the Federation should be dissolved. In the circumstances Her Majesty's Government had with regret reached the conclusion that they had no alternative but to arrange for the dissolution of the Federation.

As provided for in the West Indies (Dissolution and Interim Commissioner) Order in Council, 1962, made under the West Indies Act, 1962, the Federation was dissolved by proclamation on 31st May 1962.

Under the same Order, Sir Stephen Luke, K.C.M.G., was appointed Interim Commissioner with headquarters in Port of Spain, Trinidad, to deal with the problems resulting from the dissolution. The Interim Commission took over the assets and liabilities of the Federal Government and responsibility for certain of the services (in some cases shared by British Guiana, British Honduras, the Bahamas and the Virgin Islands) previously the responsibility of the Federal Government, until their future could be settled. The Interim Commissioner was also charged with the duty of dismantling the machinery of the defunct Federal Government and with making arrangements for the reabsorption of Federal civil servants in other public services in the area, for the payment of compensation to redundant officers and for the future payment of pensions earned in the service of the Federal Government.

The Interim Commissioner took the Chair at the Common Services Conference in July 1962 when the representatives of the Governments participating in regional services agreed to maintain the Meteorological Service (see below) the Shipping Service (see below) and financial contributions to the University of The West Indies.

By the end of June 1963 the main part of the Interim Commissioner's task had been completed and his office in Trinidad was closed down. He continued from London the work which remained to be done in connection with Federal pensions and the settlement of the assets and liabilities of the former Federation.

BRITISH CARIBBEAN COURT OF APPEAL

The British Caribbean Court of Appeal was established in June 1962 by Order in Council to replace the Federal Supreme Court, and reconstituted in September 1962, for an interim period with jurisdiction in Barbados and the Leeward and Windward Islands and British Guiana. The Court is constituted of a President and one Justice of Appeal appointed by the Interim Commissioner in pursuance of Instructions, and the Chief Justice and Judges of the Joint Supreme Court of the Leeward and Windward Islands and of the Supreme Courts of Barbados and British Guiana.

METEOROLOGY

The Caribbean Meteorological Service at present embraces all Unit Territories of the former Federation including the now independent countries of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago as well as British Guiana, British Honduras and the British Virgin Islands. There are main meteorological offices at Palisadoes Airport (Jamaica), Piarco Airport (Trinidad) and at Seawell Airport (Barbados); and supplementary offices at Pearls Airport (Grenada), Armos Vale (St. Vincent) and Stanley Field (British Honduras).

Each Government has agreed to continue to provide or receive services at least up to the same level as previously, and to contribute to the cost of a small headquarters unit with mainly co-ordinating and representational functions. Governments which do not maintain main meteorological stations will also make contributions to those which do. Each Government will employ its own staff, but staff will remain members of the Caribbean Meteorological Service and be available for transfer within the area.

SHIPPING

Under the West Indies Shipping Corporation Act, a Shipping Corporation was established to operate and maintain a regular shipping service between all the territories of the Federation of The West Indies with two ships, the "Federal Maple" and "Federal Palm", given to the Federation by the Canadian Government. Each vessel is of 3,200 tons gross (1,634 tons net) and provides accommodation for 50 cabin class passengers and 200 economy class passengers. Management of the vessels is undertaken by Messrs. Furness, Withy & Co. Ltd.

This service has been maintained since the dissolution of The West Indies under arrangements agreed between the Governments of the former federated territories. The annual deficit on operations is now met wholly from contributions by those Governments.

COMMON INSTITUTIONS AND SERVICES SHARED BY THE TERRITORIES OF ANTIGUA, DOMINICA, GRENADA, MONT-SERRAT, ST. KITS, ST. LUCIA, ST. VINCENT AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS

Police

These eight territories share a single advisory Police Service Commission which is composed of one member from each territory except, for the present, the Virgin Islands. Each member of the Commission is appointed by the Administrator
after consulting his Chief Minister and the members of the Commission elect their own Chairman. The Commission also has discretion to invite to its meetings persons with knowledge of possible candidates from outside the eight territories. The function of the Commission is to advise the Administrators in exercising their discretionary power to appoint, dismiss, promote and exercise disciplinary control over gazetted ranks in each Police Force.

**Judiciary**

A Supreme Court and a Court of Appeal for the above eight territories were established by Order in Council in 1939. Fresh provisions regarding those Courts were made by an Order in Council of 1959, and amended in 1962 in consequence of the dissolution of the Federation, which also provided for the establishment of a Judicial and Legal Service Commission composed of the Chief Justice of the Joint Supreme Court of the Leeward and Windward Islands, a Justice of Appeal of the British Caribbean Court of Appeal, a Judge or ex-Judge of a Superior Court of any part of Her Majesty's Dominions and the Chairmen of two of the advisory Public Service Commissions in the territories concerned.

Judges of the Supreme Court (other than the Chief Justice) are appointed by the Judicial and Legal Service Commission with the approval of the Secretary of State. The Chief Justice is appointed by the Secretary of State. Judges are removed from office only if the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council advises removal for inability or misbehaviour. The Judicial and Legal Service Commission advises the Administrators on the appointment, etc., of magistrates, registrars and law officers. The expenses of the Joint Courts (including the emoluments of Judges) and the Commission are borne by the eight territories in proportions specified in the Courts Order in Council of 1959 and the sums required to meet these expenses are charged on the revenue of each territory by the Order in Council.

The British Caribbean Court of Appeal which replaced the Federal Supreme Court also has certain original and appellate jurisdiction in respect of these territories.

**Other Common Institutions**

A common audit system prevails in the eight territories. A number of specialist services are shared by various of the territories by administrative arrangement.

**BRITISH CARIBBEAN CURRENCY BOARD**

Treasury Chambers, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad.

The Board was appointed by the Secretary of State in 1950, to provide for and to control the supply of a uniform currency to the Eastern Group of British Caribbean Colonies comprising Barbados, British Guiana, Trinidad and Tobago, the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands.

These Governments having indicated their intention to establish new currency authorities, a new Agreement was signed in December, 1964. This provides for a reconstituted Board to continue to provide for and control the supply of currency in the area pending the establishment of the new authorities. The Board ceased to issue notes in all the participating territories on the 1st January, 1966, but its notes remain legal tender in all territories except Trinidad and it is continuing to issue coin in all territories.

---

**THE EAST CARIBBEAN CURRENCY AUTHORITY**

P.O. Box 620C Roebuck Street,
Bridgetown, Barbados.

The East Caribbean Currency Agreement between the Governments of Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent signed in January, 1965 provides for the establishment of a common currency and an authority to issue and manage that currency in the territories of the participating Governments. The Authority also acts as agent of the participating Governments for implementing their obligations under the British Caribbean Currency Board Agreement, 1964. The new Authority began to issue new currency in October, 1965.

**REGIONAL COUNCIL OF MINISTERS**

(Barbados and The Leeward and Windward Islands)

On 19th January 1962, during the Secretary of State's visit to the West Indies, the Premier of Barbados and the Chief Ministers of Antigua, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts, St. Lucia and St. Vincent presented proposals for a new federation between their territories. Subsequently a Conference of the eight Governments in Barbados confirmed their desire that such a federation should be established, and submitted outline proposals to the Secretary of State. On 16th April 1962, the Secretary of State informed the House of Commons that the United Kingdom Government had reached the conclusion that a Federation of Barbados and the Leeward and Windward Islands appeared to offer the best solution to the problems of the area, provided that the federal constitution was such as to provide adequate powers to the central government and to offer a reasonable prospect of economic and financial stability.

The East Caribbean Federation Conference held in May 1962 at Marlborough House, London, recommended in their Report (Cmd. 1746) that there should be a federation of the eight territories, that it should be called the West Indies Federation and that the Federal capital should be in Barbados. In accordance with agreements reached at the Conference a Regional Council of Ministers was set up, under the Chairmanship of the Governor of Barbados, consisting of the Premier and Chief Ministers of each Unit Government (or their nominees) to consider any problems of common interest to the eight territories concerned in connection with the setting up of the new Federation. Fiscal and Civil Service Commissions were appointed to study the financial and public service aspects of establishing the new Federation; their reports were published in April 1963 as Cmdn. 1991 and 1992 respectively. In August, two further reports were published, the first being a survey of economic potential and capital needs of the Leeward Islands, Windward Islands and Barbados (Overseas Research Publication No. 5, H.M.S.O.); the second was a Report on a Customs Union of those territories (Barbados Government Printer).

The 1962 London Conference agreed that when its recommendations had been approved by Unit legislatures and when the two preparatory Commissions had reported, a further Conference should be held (to which opposition parties in the eight territories would be invited) between the
British and West Indian Governments to reach final decisions about the form of the new Federation.

After elections in Grenada in August 1962, the new Grenada Government began discussions with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago on the possibility of political union, and took no further part in preparation for federation.

Ministers of the other seven territories met at intervals during 1963 and 1964 without reaching complete agreement among themselves on an amended federal scheme which they wish to propose. Meanwhile the Secretary of State left London on 31st January 1965 for a tour of the territories the main purpose of which was to enable him to hear and discuss their views on federation.

In March 1965 he set out his views on federation in a despatch since published in Colonial No. 360. Antigua has taken no part in further discussions on this subject, and the Government of Barbados have announced their intention of seeking independence before considering federation further. At the beginning of 1966, therefore, there were no grounds for expecting that the Regional Council of Ministers would be able to make further progress with federation at an early date.

A series of discussions in London on constitutional arrangements with the individual territories began on 28th February 1966.

**INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION**

**THE UNITED NATIONS**

Her Majesty's Government is constitutionally responsible for the conduct of the international relations of Colonial territories and accordingly the interests of the Colonies are represented by the United Kingdom at the United Nations. Her Majesty's Government consults Colonial Governments before acceding on their behalf to international agreements which affect them.

In some of the Specialized Agencies, namely the International Telecommunications Union, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, Colonial Governments can be separately represented as associate members. In the Universal Postal Union they have combined representation through a Colonial Ensemble. In the International Telecommunications Union Colonies which are not associate members are similarly represented through a Colonial Ensemble. Some Colonies, or groups of Colonies, are separate members of the World Meteorological Organization.

The Regional Economic Commissions, the geographical scope of three of which includes most Colonies, may admit Colonial Governments to associate membership.

Hong Kong is an associate member of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

British Guiana and British Honduras are associate members of the Economic Commission for Latin America.

Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate, Mauritius and Swaziland are associate members of the Economic Commission for Africa.

Apart from the participation of Colonies directly in the work of those of the Specialized Agencies which permit it, Her Majesty's Government also, when appropriate, includes Colonial Representatives in United Kingdom delegations.

With the attainment of independence by the British Cameroons and Tanganyika in 1961, the United Kingdom no longer administers any United Nations Trust Territories, but remains a member of the Trusteeship Council.

**CARIBBEAN**

The Caribbean Commission was set up in 1946, with headquarters in Trinidad. It was a joint body representative of the Governments of France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, for the purpose of encouraging and strengthening social and economic co-operation between the Caribbean territories for which those Governments have responsibilities, and co-ordinating research in these fields. (See Cmd. 8575, paragraphs 336-344.)

Under an Agreement signed in June 1960, and brought into effect by a Joint Declaration on the 5th September 1961, the Commission was replaced by the Caribbean Organization. The functions of the Organization, whose headquarters were in Puerto Rico, were similar to those of the Commission, but its members were drawn from the territories in the region, with the metropolitan powers (except France) withdrawn to the status of observers.

At the 5th Meeting of the Caribbean Council held in Curacao from the 30th November—4th December 1964 it was decided to close the Organization. The Central Secretariat ceased operations during 1965 and the 1960 Agreement terminated on the 31st December 1965. Means of continuing regional co-operation in the fields covered by the Organization are under discussion by representatives of the member governments.

**SOUTH PACIFIC**

A regional Commission for the South Pacific was established in 1947 (Cmd. 8539) by agreement between the Governments of Australia, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. An amending Agreement, signed on 2nd October 1964, provided for the Independent State of Western Samoa and any other territory which becomes independent and was within the Commission's scope immediately before independence, to become a participating member of the Commission and remain within its scope if it wishes and is invited to do so by the participating Governments. The Netherlands ceased to be a participating Government on 31st December 1962 and various other changes were made in the Agreement as a result.

The Commission is a consultative and advisory body to the participating Governments in matters affecting the economic and social development of non-self-governing territories in the South Pacific region. Annual sessions of the Commission are held at its headquarters in Noumea, New Caledonia, and it is assisted, in framing its work programme, by annual meetings of a Research Council and triennial meetings of a Conference of territorial delegates.

The United Kingdom Senior Commissioner is Sir Derek Jakeway, Governor of Fiji and the Secretary-General, Mr. W. D. Forsyth, Noumea, New Caledonia.
LOCAL FORCES

The following local forces are maintained in the Overseas territories. Their chief role is local defence and the preservation of internal security, but in exceptional circumstances some of the regular forces serve outside their geographical regions.

Full-time Forces
Army of the Federation of South Arabia (Federal Regular Army).
Fiji Military Forces.

Part-time Forces
Antigua Defence Force.
Barbados Regiment.
Bermuda Regiment.
British Guiana Volunteer Force.
British Honduras Volunteer Guard.
Falkland Islands Defence Force.
Fiji Military Forces (territorial).
Gibraltar Regiment.
Royal Hong Kong Defence Force.
Mauritius Naval Volunteer Force.
Montserrat Defence Force.
St. Kitts Defence Force.

Some of these Forces are administered by the Colonial Governments, others by the United Kingdom Service Departments concerned. In addition the Service Departments maintain certain units in Colonial territories; these include "Locally Enlisted Personnel" wherever British forces are stationed.
