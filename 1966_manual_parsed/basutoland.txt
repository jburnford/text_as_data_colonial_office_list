BASUTOLAND

Area
Comprises an area of 11,716 square miles of which about one quarter in the west is lowland country varying in height above sea level from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, the remaining three quarters being highlands rising to a height of 11,425 feet in the Drakensberg Range, which forms the eastern boundary with Natal.

Population
In 1956 (the date of the last census) the population figures for Maseru township were: Africans 5,091, Europeans 590, Mixed Race 57 and one Asian.

A census of all races held in April 1956 gave the following figures for the population present in the Territory: Africans 638,857; Europeans 1,926; Persons of Mixed Race 644; and Asians 247. The census also gave the additional figures of 154,782 as an estimate of the number of Africans temporarily absent from the Colony for work and other purposes. The total population of Basutoland, including those temporarily absent, is estimated at 884,342 persons in 1965. (By way of comparison, a census of 1875 gave a total of 469 Europeans and 127,707 Africans in Basutoland.)

Principal Towns
The capital is Maseru, which has an estimated population of about 10,000. The other principal towns are: Butha Buthe, Leribe, Mafeteng, Mokhotlong, Qachas Nek, Mohale's Hoek and Quthing.

Geographical Features
The Colony of Basutoland is an enclave within the Republic of South Africa, its boundaries running with those of Natal to the east, the Cape Province to the south and the Orange Free State to the north and west. It lies between latitudes 28° 35' and 30° 40' south and longitudes 27° 00' and 29° 30' east. The mountain ranges run from north to south and those in the central area, named the Maluti, are spurs of the main Drakensberg which they join in the north, forming a high plateau varying in height from 9,000 to 10,500 feet. In this area two of the largest rivers in the Republic, the Orange and the Tugela, and tributaries of the Caledon, have their source.

Climate
Rainfall is variable and averages approximately 29 inches a year over the greater part of the country. Most of it falls between October and April, but
there is normally no month which has less than half an inch. Unfortunately, river discharge statistics show that most of this water is lost to Basutoland in the form of run-off. The deciding factors from an agricultural point of view are whether the rain comes in steady soaking showers at intervals suited to the growth of the staple crops or whether it comes in the form of short and heavy storms, running to waste and eroding the soil. Serious droughts, like the one of 1948-49 are rare and there are a large number of perennial streams, though not so many as existed some years ago. In the lowlands the temperatures vary from a maximum of 90° or more in summer to a minimum that rarely drops below 20° in winter; in the highlands the range is much wider and temperatures below zero are common.

History

The Basotho as a nation did not come into prominence until 1818 when Moseshi, a minor chief of the Bakoena tribe in Northern Basutoland, gathered together the remnants of the various clans that had been scattered by the raids of the Zulu and Matebele.

The new nation went through a period of struggle, first with the emigrant Boers of the Great Trek, then with the British. From 1856 until 1868 there was a series of wars with the Orange Free State burghers, Moshoeshoe lost a large portion of his country and repeatedly sought the protection of the British Government.

In 1868 the Basotho became British subjects and the boundaries of the Territory were defined by the Cape of Good Hope Notice of 13th May 1870.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition until it was annexed to the Cape Colony in 1871. The people never took kindly to the Cape Colonial rule and in 1880, after various disturbances, the Governor of the Cape extended to Basutoland the provisions of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, which included a clause for the general disarmament of the Basotho. They refused to accept the terms, and, after a war lasting nearly a year, the Act was repealed, several chiefs would not submit, and it was decided to hand over the administration to the Imperial Government. This was effected by Order in Council of 2nd February 1884.

The South Africa Act of Union of 1909, which established the Union of South Africa, included provisions for the possible inclusion in South Africa of the three territories of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland, which were administered by the High Commissioner for South Africa.

When the South African Constitution was being drawn up the Chiefs in Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland objected to any scheme which would bring their territories under the rule of South Africa. Assurances were given that no immediate change would be made in the administration of these territories, but provision was made for the possible eventual transfer subject to certain conditions for the protection of African rights embodied in the Act.

After 1909, successive South African Governments asked for the three territories to be transferred to South Africa and successive British Governments reiterated the pledge made during the passage of the 1909 South Africa Bill through Parliament, that the ultimate responsibility in the questions of a decision about transfer rested with the British Government and that no such transfer could take place until the wishes of the inhabitants of the territories had been considered. No requests for transfer have been made recently.

Constitution

Before the introduction of constitutional reforms in March 1960 Basutoland was governed under a loose-knit system by which the British Administration combined with an hereditary Chieftainship. The Basotho owe allegiance to a single Paramount Chief under whom there is a hierarchy of Chiefs and Headmen. These Chiefs and Headmen are the authorities with whom the ordinary people deal in their daily affairs, and are responsible for the day to day administration of the Territory.

The constitution which was brought into operation in March 1960 provided for an Executive Council which is advisory to both the Resident Commissioner and the Paramount Chief, and a Legislative Council known as the Basutoland National Council.

In September 1961 the Basutoland National Council passed a resolution inviting the Paramount Chief to appoint a Constitutional Commission to review the working of the Constitution and to formulate proposals for constitutional advance.

The Constitutional Commission, which was appointed early in 1962 and which consisted of representatives of the main political parties and of the Chieftainship, submitted a report to the Paramount Chief on 3rd October 1963.

In May 1964 there was a further Constitutional Conference at which agreement was reached on the introduction of a new constitution which would be followed by independence if the desire for it was confirmed by the people of Basutoland through their Parliament or through a referendum not earlier than one year after election. The Basutoland Order 1965 embodying the new constitution, was brought into operation on 30th April 1965, the date following the elections for the new National Assembly.

The result of the election was:

Basutoland National Party . . 31 seats
Basutoland Congress Party . . 25 seats
Marema-Tlou Freedom Party . . 4 seats

Under the new constitution, there are two Houses of Parliament, a Senate consisting of the 22 principal chiefs and 11 other persons nominated by the Paramount Chief, and a National Assembly consisting of 60 members elected on universal adult suffrage. The Office of Resident Commissioner ceased to exist and the Paramount Chief became the Queen's Representative. A new Office of British Government Representative was created.

At talks held in London during November, 1965 agreement was reached for the British Government Representative to assign the greater part of his responsibilities for the subjects of external affairs, internal security, and defence to Basutoland Ministers with effect from the 1st January, 1966, subject to conditions which are listed in the Report of the discussions. The Public Service Commission and the Judicial Service Commission become executive on the same date. The British Government Representative retains reserved powers to ensure proper financial administration.

Taxation

The main forms of direct taxation are Basuto tax, income tax and poll tax (payable by all male adult persons who do not pay Basuto tax).
The principal sources of indirect revenue are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Basutoland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades and businesses. There are also death duties, stamp duty and a wool and mohair export duty.

**Public Finance**

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1961–62  | 1,804,223  | 3,015,713       |
| 1962–63  | 1,883,597  | 3,269,332       |
| 1963–64  | 2,095,245  | 3,503,758       |
| 1964–65 (estimated) | 2,479,343 | 4,169,680       |
| 1965–66 (estimated) | 2,084,980 | 4,721,791       |

Excluding Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1965–66:

- Customs and Excise: £1,487,000
- Taxes and duties: £1,113,000
- Posts and telegraphs: £270,300

As revenue was expected to be substantially below expenditure and the Territory had no central balance the United Kingdom Government approved grant-in-aid of £2,350,000 for 1965–66.

**Currency**

The currency is the same as in the Republic of South Africa. During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from Sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 Sterling = R.2; 1 shilling = 10 cents).

**Development Plans**

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1959 Basutoland received an allocation of £1·2m. in grants and exchequer loans towards development over the period 1959–64.

An additional allocation of £418,000 was made in 1961.

A further allocation of £1·2m. was approved in September 1963, to provide for development up to March 1966. The programme provides principally for agricultural, medical, educational and public works services.

**Education**

African education is largely in the hands of three missions (Paris Evangelical, Roman Catholic and Anglican), under the direction of the Education Department. Grants-in-aid are paid by Government to the three missions to cover the salaries of all teachers on the approved grant-in-aid list. In many aided schools of the Roman Catholic mission, assistance is given by unaided teachers, particularly Sisters. Small grants are paid from territorial funds to improve the equipment in primary schools. Estimated expenditure on grants-in-aid during financial year 1964–65 is £618,325.

There are 1,095 schools and institutions in the Territory of which all but 13 are under mission control, and of these mission schools 980 are either wholly or partly aided. The total enrolment in primary schools is 165,041, with 2,681 teachers of whom 1,059 have no professional certificates. In secondary schools the enrolment is 2,697, with 126 teachers all with professional training. The enrolment in the teacher training schools is 574, in schools offering a technical course and in house-craft schools 645.

The University of Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland formed by Royal Charter, formally came into existence on the 1st January 1964, and is the independent successor to the Roman Catholic Pius XII College at Roma. It awards its own degrees, and is intended by 1967 to have some 300 students primarily, but not exclusively, from Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland. Students are to be enrolled regardless of race, sex, nationality or religion. The immediate aim of the University is to meet the needs of Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland for qualified administrators in the Civil Service and the Judiciary, and in the trading profession, and to produce graduates qualified in Agriculture, Law, Economics and Commerce.

Tuition in primary schools is free, and bursaries are available for the most deserving cases at all stages of secondary, teacher training and University work.

The number of known Basotho students abroad on full time courses of a year’s duration or more at the end of 1964 was 119, an increase of some 32 on the figure for the end of 1963.

**Health**

The establishment of the Government medical staff consists of a Permanent Secretary, a Senior Medical Officer, one Surgeon Specialist, 21 Medical Officers, one Medical Officer of Health, one Medical Officer for Mental Health. There is also one post of Dental Surgeon. There are nine Government hospitals, staffed by European Nursing Sisters with subordinate African staff. There are nine Government Hospitals, all of which, except two, are staffed by African Nursing Sisters with subordinate African staff. There is accommodation for 822 patients in the Government Hospitals. The Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Maseru, is being extended by two wards, one surgical and the other for children, and when these are complete there will be accommodation for about 310 beds and a modern Nurses’ Home.

The Mission Hospitals have increased to eight, (all Government subsidised) with the opening of Tebellong and Ma-Mohau hospitals, both in the mountain areas. They provide 537 beds. The overall bed-population ratio is about 1 to 600, whilst the Doctor-population ratio is about 1 to 33,000. Health centres in mountain dispensaries provide out-patient medical facilities, and, where a trained African nurse is a member of the staff, maternity services to people living in remote areas. During 1964 19,345 patients were admitted to Government hospitals and 7,097 to Mission hospitals. There were 236,994 out-patients at Government hospitals and 67,738 at Mission hospitals. The population of the Leper Settlement, four miles out of Maseru remains relatively static. The new Mental Hospital in the Leper Settlement grounds is nearing completion and will provide accommodation for up to 120 patients.

The major health problems are associated with deficiency diseases, attributable to poor nutrition education and poor agricultural methods. The incidence of tuberculosis is understandably also high. Lack of vital statistics, e.g. births and deaths, makes it impossible to give accurate data. Diseases due to poor environmental conditions e.g. enteric fever are endemic, and the infectious diseases take a heavy toll of infants and children.
Communications

The Territory is linked with the railway system of the Republic of South Africa by a short branch-line from Maseru, the capital, to Marseilles on the Bloemfontein-Natal main line. One mile of this line is in Basutoland. The South African Railway runs near the boundaries of the Territory and goods are transported by road to the nearest railway station across the border.

The Road Motor Transport Department of the South African Railways runs regular services between Fouriesburg and Butha-Buthe, Zastron and Quthing, Zastron and Mohale's Hoek, and Quthing and Sebapala, and within the Territory in the lowland areas there are a number of bus services owned and operated by Basotho.

The greater part of Basutoland is very mountainous and in this area all transport is by pack animals. A new mountain motor road running eastwards from Maseru into the mountains has been constructed in order to open up the interior and facilitate its development and administration. The road has reached a point 80 miles from Maseru.

On the western side of Basutoland a fairly good road system has been developed in the strip of agricultural country running from north to south. The main roads traverse the whole of this area, with branches leading west to the principal points of exit. From the main roads a number of feeder-roads lead towards the foothills.

Principal Occupations

Basutoland is a pastoral country without factories or industrial undertakings, and since the produce of the land is insufficient to support the total population, many able-bodied Basotho leave the Territory each year to take up employment in the Republic of South Africa. The Government protects labourers by forbidding recruitment for any mine or other concern where the conditions of work are not good. All labourers recruited by agents in Basutoland for work outside the Territory have to be attested before an official and the contract must be according to Government Regulations.

The diamond diggings at Letsérg-la-Terac though at present haphazard and inefficiently carried out, have proved a very useful source of income to enterprising Basotho. The Government also derived useful revenue in the form of taxes from the sale of diamonds.

Main Crops and Products

So far there has been little evidence of any exploitable mineral deposits in the Territory. Agriculture and animal husbandry are Basutoland's main sources of wealth. The chief exports at present are wheat, wool and mohair. It is estimated that 1,000,000 acres are under cultivation.

The soils in the mountain areas are of basaltic origin, while those in the lowlands are derived mainly from underlying cave sandstone. In the lowlands the soil has been cropped continuously for upwards of 80 years. Due to the absence of fuel, practically all cattle manure is burnt, so that little or no organic matter is returned to the land. Thus with increasing population, both human and livestock, excessive demands have been made on the soil, which has lost its structure and become subject to serious erosion. Controlled grazing has brought back a grass cover and has effectively halted the loss of soil by storm water run off in the mountain areas. In 1961 some 1,252,000 trees were planted as part of soil conservation measures.

There has been no appreciable change in the total arable acreage estimated at 1,000,000 acres.

Weather conditions had a decisive effect on both winter and summer crops during 1964/65. The main Lowland summer crops, maize and sorghum, were adversely affected by drought and frost while the winter crops, peas and wheat, benefited greatly from the heavy snow which fell in June 1964. The wheat crop of about 100,000 bags was an all-time record. Owing to the prolonged drought, yields of mountain peas and wheat were below average.

Soil conservation and reclamation work has progressed at a slower rate than in the past. Some 25 miles of fencing was erected and about 140,000 trees were planted. Twenty dams were completed in the two Improvement Areas of Thaba-Phatsoa and Mejametalana. Some of the stored water is being used for vegetable production.

There are about 1,400,000 up-graded merino sheep, 750,000 Angora goats and 400,000 cattle in the territory.

Trade

Basutoland has no industries and imports the consumer goods and capital items it needs as well as a certain amount of agricultural produce and livestock. Exports consist almost entirely of agricultural commodities and livestock, the main exports being wool and mohair, followed by wheat, sorghum and cattle. The value of imports usually exceeds the value of exports but the adverse balance is partly offset by the export of labour to the Republic of South Africa.

| Year | Total Imports | Total Exports |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 1958 | £2,947,274   | £1,444,267   |
| 1959 | £2,893,940   | £1,608,984   |
