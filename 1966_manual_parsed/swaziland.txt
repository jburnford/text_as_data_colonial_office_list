**SWAZILAND**

**Area**

Swaziland is bordered on the north, west and south by the Transvaal, on the north-east by Mozambique and on the south-east by Natal. It lies between latitudes 24° 50' and 26° 40' south and longitudes 30° 25' and 32° 5' east. With a total area of 6,704 square miles, it is a country of many diversities and many distinctive characteristics.

**Population**

A general census will take place in May 1966. The estimated population in mid-1964, including residents employed temporarily outside Swaziland was 294,300. In mid-1962 it was estimated that the total population was 280,300 comprising 270,000 Africans (an approximation) and, shown by a census of the two groups, 8,040 Europeans and 2,260 Euraficans. This figure includes about 10,300 residents employed temporarily outside the Territory. It is estimated that 26,810 residents were born in countries other than Swaziland (South Africa 19,020; Mozambique 4,070 and British Isles 760). The 1956 census showed that the population of Swaziland was 240,511.
Principal towns

The capital is Mbabane (population 8,400) and the next two largest proclaimed townships are Manzini (7,800) and Stegi (3,400). In addition, four new industrial centres have populations between 4,600 and 7,000. They are: Tshaneni/Mhlume (sugar), Big Bend/Ubombo (sugar), Bunya/Mhlambanyati (wood pulp) and Havelock (asbestos).

Geographical Features

Geographically and climatically, it is divisible into four physiographic provinces—the broken mountainous high-veld in the west, with altitudes averaging over 4,000 feet, the middle-veld which is mostly mixed farming country about 2,000 feet lower and the low-veld, a hot woodland region typified by aloes, acacias and pterocarpus, and bounded on the east by the Lubombo mountains, with an average altitude of 1,500 feet. The Lubombo mountains form the fourth physiographic province. Four rivers, the Komati, Usutu, Mbuluzi and Ngwavuma, flow from west to east, cutting their way through the Lubombo mountains to the Indian Ocean. The exploitation of these rivers is particularly important to the agricultural development of the middle and bush veld, where irrigation projects are giving the scenery a different aspect.

Climate

75% to 80% of the rains come in the summer half of the year from October to March. Year to year variability of totals is extremely large, especially in the low-veld. Drought hazard is also most serious in the low-veld. The average rainfall at Mbabane in the high-veld is 54·6 inches, at Manzini (formerly Bremersdorp) in the middle-veld 35·6 inches and at Big Bend in the low-veld 20·8 inches. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures are respectively 72·8°F. and 51·6°F. at Mbabane; 79·2°F. and 56·4°F. at Manzini; and 84·5°F. and 59·8°F. at Big Bend.

History

Swaziland remained nominally independent until 1890. From 1890 to 1894 the United Kingdom and the Transvaal (South African Republic) Governments established a species of condominium which was replaced in 1894 by an arrangement under which the South African Republic was given powers of protection and administration without actual incorporation. After the Anglo-Boer war, the administration of Swaziland was transferred to the Governor of the Transvaal, who was also the High Commissioner of South Africa, but in 1907 responsibility for Swaziland was transferred from the Governor to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Swaziland therefore, remained under the control of the United Kingdom when the Transvaal became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910.

The South Africa Act of Union of 1909, which established the Union of South Africa, included provisions for the possible inclusion in South Africa of the three territories of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland, which were administered by the High Commissioner for South Africa.

When the South African Constitution was being drawn up the Chiefs in Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and Swaziland objected to any scheme which would bring their territories under the rule of South Africa. Assurances were given that no immediate change would be made in the administration of these territories, but provision was made for the possible eventual transfer subject to certain conditions for the protection of African rights embodied in the Act.

After 1909 successive South African Governments asked for the three territories to be transferred to South Africa and successive British Governments reiterated the pledge made during the passage of the 1909 South Africa Bill through Parliament, that the ultimate responsibility in the question of a decision about transfer rested with the British Government and that no such transfer could take place until the wishes of the inhabitants of the territories had been considered. No requests for transfers have been made recently.

Constitution and Administration

In 1902, at the end of the Anglo-Boer War, a British Special Commissioner with a small force of the South African Constabulary was sent into Swaziland to establish a provisional administration. An Order in Council, dated 25th June 1903, established the relationship between Great Britain and the Swazi and constituted the basic authority under which the Administration was conducted by Her Majesty's Government.

In May 1963, the Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs published a White Paper (Cmdnd. 2052) outlining a constitution for Swaziland. This constitution was established by the Swaziland Order in Council, 1963, which was signed by Her Majesty the Queen on December 20th. It made provision for an Executive Council of eight members (four official and four unofficial) and a Legislative Council of four official members, twenty-four elected members and up to three members nominated by Her Majesty's Commissioner. Of the twenty-four elected members, eight were to be persons who were Swazis or Eurafriics, certified by the Ngwenyama (the Paramount Chief) in Council as having been elected in accordance with Swazi traditional methods; eight were to be persons who were Europeans or Eurafriics, of whom four were to be elected by voters registered on a "European Roll" and four elected by voters registered on a "National Roll"; and eight persons of any race who were to be elected by voters registered on the National Roll. Election on the National Roll would virtually be by universal adult franchise.

The country was divided into four National Roll constituencies to correspond with the four administrative districts. Each constituency was to return three members, one of whom had to be European or Eurafriican. The European Roll constituency was the whole of Swaziland.

The elections for the first Legislative Council took place in June 1964. The Imbokodvo National Movement won ten National Roll seats and the United Swaziland Association gained two National Roll seats and the four European Roll seats. Five other political parties contested the elections but failed to win a seat.

Her Majesty's Commissioner nominated one person to the Legislative Council.

The post of Her Majesty's Commissioner is equivalent to the status of Governor; the Commissioner assents to legislation and is directly responsible to the Secretary of State.

The Territory is divided into four districts—Shiselweni, Lubombo, Manzini and Hhohho—administered by District Commissioners who are the principal executive officers of Government.
within their districts. Local government matters and district administration fall under the Secretary for Local Administration and Social Development. The judiciary falls under the Chief Justice, who is also the Chief Justice for Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate.

The Swazi political system is strongly rooted in tradition. The Ngwenyama is a constitutional ruler who is advised by his kinsmen and chosen councillors. Action cannot be initiated by the Ngwenyama without the approval of two formally constituted councils. The smaller of these, the Liqoqo, comprises the more important of the Ngwenyama’s agnatic kin and number of chosen advisers. It meets once a week to deal with national matters which are usually channelled to it by a standing committee of the larger council, the Libandla. The Libandla embraces every adult male in the Swazi Nation. It usually meets once each year and it is recognized as the final body from which approval for any contemplated act of legislation should be obtained. The Ngwenyama, by virtue of his formal position and, in the case of the present ruler, his personal prestige (he has ruled for 44 years), is in a position to exercise great influence over the deliberations of his councils. Day-to-day contact between the Government and the main council is maintained through the standing committee of the council. To this traditional ruling system has been appended the Swazi National Treasury with a revenue in the region of R210,000 per year and formally constituted Swazi Courts from which appeal ultimately lies to the High Court of Swaziland.

The powers of the Ngwenyama and the National Council, in relation to the issue of orders regulating a wide range of activities of both social and economic consequence and also the powers of chiefs in respect of maintenance of law and order, are embodied in the Swazi Administration Proclamation. From the central institutions of the Swazi National Administration responsibility devolves upon the chiefs and their ndunas. The chiefs, who number some 172, have their own Liqoqo and Libandla to assist and advise them. In an effort to provide focal points which would serve as centres of local administration and through which orders and instructions could be disseminated, twenty-nine Tinkundla or rural area councils were established in 1956. Each Nkundla consists of chiefs grouped together on a geographical basis under an appointed nduna. These Tinkundla have no executive or financial powers, but in some areas they have provided an important point of contact between the Government and the Swazi, and have proved of value in promoting rural development work. In the main, however, they have not proved effective due to lack of support from some conservative chiefs who have seen in Tinkundla a means whereby their personal traditional powers might be curtailed, and the fact that some Tinkundla are not well sited.

One of the principal functions of the District Commissioner is to co-ordinate development work within his district without interfering in technical details. To assist him in this work, District Teams under his chairmanship, consider local problems and formulate plans for development, in accordance with policy decisions transmitted through the Secretariat from Her Majesty’s Commissioner. They consist of the heads of the technical services in the district, such as the Medical, Education and Agricultural Departments, rural development workers and representatives of the Swazi.

**Taxation**

The main forms of direct taxation are African tax, European poll tax and income tax, towards which mining companies contribute the major share. The principal sources of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Swaziland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades. There are also death duties.

**Public Finance**

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1961–62  | 1,667,628  | 2,077,628      |
| 1962–63  | 1,892,583  | 2,325,083      |
| 1963–64  | 1,955,231  | 2,818,972      |
| 1964–65  | 2,196,764  | 3,908,623      |
| 1965–66 (Estimate) | 3,263,612 | 4,263,612 |

Excluding expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1965–66:

- Customs and Excise: £956,288
- Income tax: £1,194,000
- Posts and telegraphs: £222,000

As revenue was expected to fall below expenditure in 1965–66 and the central balance was exhausted, the United Kingdom Government approved a total grant-in-aid for 1965–66 amounting to £1,000,000.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation in Swaziland is that of the Republic of South Africa. During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from Sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R.2; 1 shilling = 10 cents).

**Development Plans**

Under the Commonwealth Development Act of 1963, Swaziland received an allocation of £2,300,000 towards development expenditure during the period 1963/66.

Taking into account savings carried forward from the previous allocations of Colonial Development and Welfare funds and also funds made available for Research projects, the total assistance made available towards the 1963/66 Development Plan was approximately £2,475,000, allocated as follows:

- Infrastructure: £190,000
- Economic: £798,000
- Social Services: £1,247,000
- Administrative: £225,000
- Reserved: £15,000

An additional £175,000 was made available from Commonwealth Development funds in November 1963, bringing the total assistance towards development expenditure in the period 1963/66 to £2,65m.

The construction of the first railway in Swaziland began in mid-1962 and was formally opened on November 5 1964. The railway runs a distance of 137 miles to the Mozambique border and links...
Swaziland with the port of Lourenço Marques. Its construction will make possible the development of large iron ore deposits at Ngwenya and will facilitate the export of wood pulp and sugar. The Swaziland Iron Ore Development Company has entered into an agreement to mine over 12 million tons of iron ore for shipment to Japan during the next 10 years. The first shipment of 40-70,000 long tons from the Ngwenya Mine was loaded at Lourenço Marques on December 7, 1964.

**Education**

Schools in Swaziland were up to 1962 classified as African, European or Eurafrican. The accepted policy of integration was put into practice in January 1963, and while the original race will predominate in the respective schools for some years to come, it is inappropriate to describe them as African, European or Eurafrican.

There were, in 1964, 374 schools with 50,904 pupils made up of 47,944 Africans, 1,513 Europeans and 856 Eurafricans. Of the total enrolment, 47,894 were in primary classes, 2,783 in secondary classes, and 227 in technical and vocational training classes.

**Health**

Posts are provided in the Medical Department for the Director, 10 Medical Officers, 2 Medical Officers of Health, 2 Pharmacists, 5 Dispensers, 2 Matrons, 13 Nursing Sisters, 4 Health inspectors, 102 Nurses as well as auxiliary medical staff. 9 Doctors and 20 Nursing Sisters as well as 41 Nurses are employed at Mission Hospitals, subsidised by Government.

There are four Government hospitals, at Mbabane, Hlatikulu, Mankaiana and Pigg’s Peak. At Mbabane there are 168 beds, Hlatikulu 137 beds, Mankaiana 33 beds and Pigg’s Peak 39 beds. The Raleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital (Nazarene Mission) at Manzini has accommodation for 275 patients, the Roman Catholic Mission Hospital at Stegi for 67 patients and the Mahamba Methodist Hospital for 30 patients.

There are 15 Government, 24 Mission and three other clinics, financed by the Swazi National Treasury, in the Territory. The headquarters of the public health staff under the Medical Officer of Health is at Manzini where there is in addition a W.H.O./U.N.I.C.E.F. Tuberculosis Control Centre.

**Communications**

The road motor-transport services of the South African Railways Administration and the Portuguese East African Administration carry both goods and passengers and operate between Swaziland and the railheads in the neighbouring territories. Construction of a railway line to the Mozambique border began in 1962 and was formally opened on 5th November 1964. The railway runs a distance of 137 miles and links up to the Mozambique border with the railway line to Lourenço Marques.

The Territory is served by a network of roads which are being rapidly brought to good standards. There is an extensive telecommunications system.

**Main Crops and Products**

Cattle form the main wealth of the Swazis and the total number owned increased from 146,542 in 1921 to 435,773 in 1964. The number of cattle owned by others increased from 63,748 in 1921 to 99,110 in 1964. In 1964 there were 247,604 goats, 10,409 sheep and 9,619 pigs.

Slaughter cattle are exported to markets in Johannesburg and Durban which are controlled by export quotas allocated by the South African Meat Industry Control Board. The number of cattle exported to the Republic of South Africa in 1964 decreased owing to drought conditions in Swaziland. In 1963 it was 26,692 and in 1964 13,737. Total production of butter in 1964 was 407,862.

Mining is an important part of Swaziland’s economy. The Havelock asbestos mine in the north-western corner of the Territory is one of the largest asbestos mines in the world and is apparently assured of a life of at least 30 years at present rates of output. Rich deposits of iron ore northwest of Mbabane are being developed with the completion of the railway link to Mozambique. Other deposits of iron ore are known to occur in the Hhohho and Shiselweni districts. There is a small tin-mining industry and barytes is being worked in the Mbabane district. There are extensive deposits of low volatile bituminous and anthracitic coal in the low-yeld. The bituminous coal deposits are being worked to provide coal for the railway and the sugar mills. The refractory minerals diaspore and andalusite are being worked near Sicunusa, where pyrophyllite is also being exploited. In the same district high grade kaolin is mined. There are three small gold mines in production in the Hhohho district. Recently further gold values have been intersected in encouraging exploratory work in the Hhohho area.

The agricultural potential of Swaziland is considerable and most crops can be grown. There has been an immense improvement in agricultural methods among the Swazi due to the stimulus of the rural development schemes which were inaugurated in 1949.

During the last ten years much has been done to lay the foundations for the development of this potential, both on Title Deed and Swazi Nation land. One of the most important aspects of this work has been the establishment of an agricultural research service in the Territory, based principally on Malkerns Research Station and the Lowveld Experimental Station, Big Bend.

Maize, which is the staple food of the Swazi, is the most important dryland crop. Nevertheless, 18,400 short tons of maize had to be imported in 1964 to meet the food requirements of the country.

The most important dryland cash crops are cotton and tobacco. The 1964 production of cotton was 5,211 short tons valued at £347,400 and of tobacco 414,451 lb. worth £28,410.

Irrigation agriculture is centred on three main schemes; that on the Komati River, developed by the Colonial (now Commonwealth) Development Corporation, commands 30,000 acres of irrigable land; the other two privately run projects at Malkerns and Big Bend extract water from the Great Usutu River and command a total of 27,000 irrigable acres. There are numerous minor irrigation schemes throughout the middle and low-yeld regions and the total irrigated area in 1963 was close on 55,000 acres. Principal crops grown on these schemes are sugar cane, citrus and rice; the production of other irrigated crops such as cotton and maize is being investigated by the research service. During the 1963–64 season sugar production amounted to 111,000 tons of milled sugar from 754,000 tons of cane delivered to mills. Exports of 96,144 short tons of sugar in the calendar year 1964 earned £3,796,700. Citrus fruit marketed through the local co-operative amounted to 135,000 export cases and 251,000...
pockets in 1963 worth a total of about £150,000. There were 538,000 citrus trees in orchard by April 1963. The 1964 rice crop, worth £342,500, totalled 6,960 short tons.

The Republic of South Africa is the principal market for the Territory's agricultural produce. All cotton, tobacco, rice, bananas and some of the sugar produced find a ready market in that country. Rice, citrus and tobacco are marketed through co-operative organisations, the last two named being affiliated with similar organisations in the Republic of South Africa.

Considerable development has taken place in the forestry industry during the last two decades. In mid-1964 there were 172,000 acres of pine forest and 15,300 acres of eucalyptus on plantations over 100 acres in extent. The largest of the three main forestry projects, the Usutu Pulp Company, entered the production stage towards the end of 1961. This company, which was initiated by the Colonial Development Corporation (now the Commonwealth Development Corporation), aims to export 100,000 tons of unbleached wood pulp annually. Timber and timber products worth £2,883,350 were exported during 1964 as compared with £2,133,000 in 1963.
