ST. LUCIA

Area and Population

According to recent aerial surveys, the area is about 238 square miles. The population at the beginning of 1965 was estimated at 100,000.

| Principal Town | 1960 Census Population |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Castries (capital) | 4,353 |

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, with magnificent scenery. The highest peak is Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet); the most spectacular are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September-October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

History

Neither the date of discovery, nor the discoverer, of St. Lucia is known, for according to the evidence of Columbus’s voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1633, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L’Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d’Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d’Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June 1803, was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua (see page 55).

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from £1.2c. in every £4·80 of the first £480·00, to £3·12 in every £4·80 above £24,000. Companies pay £1·92 in every £4·80 on their chargeable income.

Development Plans

During 1964 schemes totalling £104,325 were approved under C.D. & W. Development Programme 1960–64. The schemes fall under the following heads:

| Head                  | Amount £ |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Administration        | 538      |
| Production            | 50,692   |
| Communications        | 16,147   |
| Social Services       | 36,948   |

£104,325

There are three secondary schools with 939 pupils on roll and fifty-two primary and infant schools which cater for pupils from 4 to 15 years of age. The number of children on roll in these
schools is 23,120. Adult education is provided by the Extra Mural Department of the U.W.I. and by organised voluntary groups. Community education centres provide facilities whereby the people of the area can meet to discuss matters of common interest and to take part in recreational activities.

The estimated (revised) total expenditure for 1964 was $1,060,000 compared with $32,122 in 1935.

Libraries

There is a Central Library in Castries and a branch library in Soufrière. Small branches are also maintained in the towns and villages.

Health

With the eradication of malaria after a five-year programme, other parasitic diseases have been thrown into sharp focus. Foremost among these is schistosomiasis which affects 30% of the island population and is to be found in almost every area of the island. In some areas, 70% of schoolchildren are affected. Hookworm and ascariasis are very common and survey figures for 1965 indicate 75% to 85% children affected.

Yaws and venereal diseases are among the most prevalent diseases as is tuberculosis. Leprosy is not common but a few cases are detected each year.

In the Environmental Sanitation Programme, 7,500 latrine units have been installed in private homes in rural areas. Spring protection and well drilling is undertaken to provide safe water supplies for isolated rural communities.

A Nutrition section came into being in December 1962. Designed to improve the nutritional status of the population and encourage production of vegetables and small animals by instruction of schoolchildren in market gardening and animal husbandry, the work of the section has already made inroads towards the eradication of infantile malnutrition which was responsible for 200 deaths of children under the age of 3 years in 1962.

Curative services are provided by seven district medical officers and three specialists based at Victoria Hospital, Castries, where there are also two resident medical officers. Available beds are 225 general (including obstetrics), 50 tuberculosis, 140 mental and 120 in the Home for Aged and Infirm.

Communications

There are two airfields in St. Lucia—Vigie Airport and Beane Field Airport—owned and operated by the Government of St. Lucia for scheduled and charter services.

Air services with other territories are maintained by British West Indian Airways and Leeward Islands Air Transport, and by Pan-American Airways. B.W.I.A. is owned by the Trinidad Government and L.I.A.T. is a subsidiary of B.W.I.A. Charter services are undertaken by these companies, principally between the Eastern Caribbean Governments and the Governments of Jamaica and Trinidad. Migrants and tourist charter flights are undertaken by various companies.

The total mileage of the island’s road system is 418-10.

The island is served by the following main Shipping Lines from Europe:

Harrison Lines—Cargo Vessels.
Geest Industries—Cargo and Passenger Vessels.
French Lines—Passenger Vessels.

Numerous Inter-island Craft are the main means of communication with neighbouring islands.

During 1964 1,609 vessels called at St. Lucia. Gross tonnage handled was 1,609,156.

Broadcasting

There are two broadcasting stations. Radio Caribbean International St. Lucia, a commercial radio station with a power output of 20,000 watts, broadcasts daily in French and English.

W.I.B.S. Castries is a sub-station of the Windward Islands Broadcasting Service. (See under Grenada—page 116.)

Principal Occupations

Most of the working population is engaged in agriculture, fishing, and lumbering (15,144). According to the 1960 Population Census employment in other major industrial groups is manufacturing (3,468), transportation (1,156), commerce (2,478), services (3,997).

There were eleven Trade Unions at the end of 1964: ten Workers’ and one Employers’ Organisation.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are bananas, coconuts, cocoa, fruit, nutmegs, mace, ground provision and citrus.

Livestock estimates are: cattle 9,000, pigs 10,000, sheep 6,000, goats 5,000, poultry 50,000.

There is a fair amount of fishing, but the supply of fish does not meet the demand. The number of fishing boats has decreased and also the number of fishing days.

The principal manufactures are rum, citrus products, coconut products (copra and edible oil, soap), cigarettes and mineral waters.
