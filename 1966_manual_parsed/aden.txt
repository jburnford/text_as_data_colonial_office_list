ADEN AND THE PROTECTORATE OF SOUTH ARABIA

ADEN

Area
Aden is about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia. The area is 75 square miles.

Population
At the census taken in 1955 the total population recorded was 138,441 made up as follows:

| Per cent |
|----------|
| Arabs     | 75·2 |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 11·4 |
| Somalis   | 7·7 |
| Jews      | 0·6 |
| Europeans | 3·2 |
| Others    | 1·9 |

Since that census the population of Aden has increased to about 220,000 with the following approximate distribution:

| Districts                                      | Population |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Aden (including Tawahi, Maaea, Crater and Khormaksar) | 145,000    |
| Sheikh Othman                                  | 60,000     |
| Little Aden                                    | 15,000     |

Geographical Features
The territory consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas which are joined by a flat sandy foreshore, and form the modern harbour. The principal parts of Aden are:

(a) The main peninsula on which are the chief town of Crater, the wharf shipyard and residential area of Maalla and the modern harbour suburb of Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased to the Armed Forces of the Crown and known collectively as Steamer Point.

(b) The Khormaksar isthmus where there is a large joint user RAF/civil airport and a residential area.

(c) The strip of mainland between the two peninsulas which includes the township of Sheikh Othman and the villages of Hiswa and Imad.

(d) The Little Aden peninsula where B.P. Refinery (Aden) Ltd. have a modern oil refinery and which includes two fishing villages of Bureika and Bir Fuqum and a military cantonment.

Climate
The climate is not unhealthy, but heat and humidity are trying between April and October. It is cool and pleasant during the rest of the year which is when the north-east monsoon blows. Rainfall is rare and some years there is none, but as much as eight inches has been known to fall in a year.

History
The plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden led to the capture of Aden by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company in 1839 under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy.

The need to establish coaling stations on trade routes because of the replacement of sailing ships by steamers was one of the reasons which led to the occupation of Aden by the British. Little Aden was obtained by purchase in 1868. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as the Colony of Aden from 1st April 1937.

Aden, a free port, owes its modern commercial prosperity largely to the fact that it is a refuelling station situated closer to the production centres of the Persian Gulf than any other great port on the main Eastern Trade routes. The opening of the oil refinery in 1954 added further to its prosperity and strengthened its position as a bunkering port.

Constitution
In accordance with the provisions of the Federation of South Arabia (Accession of Aden) Order, 1963, Aden, while remaining under British sovereignty, became the twelfth Member State of the Federation on 18th January 1963. The title of the Governor was changed to High Commissioner for Aden and the Protectorate of South Arabia.

On the same date there was brought into operation a new constitution for Aden, prescribed in the Aden (Constitution) Order in Council, 1962. The constitution provides for a Council of Ministers, consisting of a Chief Minister and not less than six other Ministers (appointed by the High Commissioner on the advice of the Chief Minister), in addition to the Attorney-General. The High Commissioner is normally bound to act upon the advice of the Council of Ministers, subject to the retention of his general reserved powers, but he is responsible for external affairs, defence, internal security, police, and the Aden public service. There is provision for a Legislative Council consisting of sixteen elected members, six nominated members, and the Attorney-General, as well as a Speaker.

The Federal Constitution having been given the force of law in Aden by the Accession Order in Council, the Government of the Federation of South Arabia has the power to legislate for Aden State on matters under its exclusive authority or under the concurrent authority of the Federation and the State. In any conflict of laws, Federal law will prevail over State law. The High Commissioner, however, retains over-riding powers in respect of security in Aden.

The Constitution for Aden also includes a Code of Human Rights, to which Federal legislation which applies to Aden is subject. As a result of the unwillingness of Aden Ministers to cooperate in dealing with the internal security situation caused by terrorism, those provisions in the Aden constitution providing for Ministers and a State legislature were suspended in September, 1965, and the High Commissioner was given powers to govern Aden directly, subject to the continuance of the Federal Government's share of responsibility for Aden.

Land Policy
Under Section 75 of the new Constitution, and the Crown Lands Ordinance, the High Commissioner is empowered to grant leases or alienate on Her Majesty's behalf, any Crown Land for building, agricultural or any other purpose, on any terms and conditions as he may think fit.
The administration of the Crown Lands Ordinance is under the charge of the Commissioner of Lands, who is appointed by the High Commissioner.

**Taxation**

Aden is a free port and there is no general customs tariff, although certain items bear Federal customs duty.

Income tax is a State matter and in Aden the Income Tax Ordinance, 1961, provides for the payment of a graduated tax by individuals ranging from 1/- to 15/- in the £ on chargeable income. Companies pay at the rate of 6/6d. in the £.

**Public Finance***

| Year       | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1960–1961  | 4,366,603   | 4,344,569       |
| 1961–1962  | 4,697,110   | 4,713,818       |
| 1962–1963  | 5,532,563   | 5,475,281       |
| 1963–1964  | 4,156,991(ii)| 3,919,255(ii)   |
| 1964–1965  | 4,227,825   | 4,122,780       |
| 1965–1966  | 4,184,841(iii)| 4,170,541(iii)|

*Excludes figures for Public Utilities.

(i) Includes transfers of £550,000 in 1960–61, £900,000 in 1961–62, £900,000 in 1962–63 and £750,000 in 1963–64 from surplus balances to a Development Fund.

(ii) Excludes figures for Departments transferred to Federation after Aden’s accession.

(iii) Estimated.

In 1963–1964, £3,012,291 was derived from direct taxes and miscellaneous revenue (mainly income tax) and £1,144,700 from departmental revenue. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

| Expenditure (£) |
|-----------------|
| Public Works    | 612,720       |
| Public Debt     | 545,561       |
| Police          | 430,145       |

Expenditure on development projects amounted to £1,570,303.

**Development Plans**

The Development Plan for the period 1960–64 was approved by the Legislative Council during 1960 and provided for expenditure as follows:

| Social Services (£) |
|---------------------|
| Education           | £550,000      |
| Medical and Public Health | £866,469 |
| Communications and Public Utilities excluding Electricity | £1,416,469 |
| Land and Housing    | £2,127,000    |
| Miscellaneous       | £694,000      |
| Residual 1955–60 Schemes | £484,974 |

By the end of the financial year 31st March, 1964, a total of £5·2m. had been spent but since some of the projects had not been completed, the period was extended for a year; this cost approximately £1·5m. which sum included provision for certain other projects.

The plan originally approved, envisaged the following finance:

| Source                        | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| Opening balance in the Development Fund | 494,598    |
| Contributions from revenue    | 1,450,000  |
| Colonial Development & Welfare Grants | 1,000,463  |
| Services                      | 174,000    |
| Municipality                  | 100,000    |

£3,219,061 to be supplemented by loan funds amounting to £2,626,382.

During the period it became possible to vote much more from revenue than had been expected, and with assistance received from Colonial Development and Welfare grants and other sources, it was only necessary to draw £300,000 from the Exchequer loan fund. Actual transfers from revenue from 1960 to 1963 amounted to £4,450,000.

A new development plan for the period 1965–1970 is under consideration.

**Electricity**

A statutory electricity corporation now exercises the functions previously filled by the Aden Government Electricity Department.

**Libraries**

The Municipal library services provide some 45,500 books in English, Arabic and Urdu. The Miswat Library in Crater and the Travelling Library which visits other districts in the Municipal area, together serve about 2,400 members.

There are well-stocked and expanding libraries financed by the Federal Ministry of Education at Al Bayoomi College, the Aden Girls’ College, the Technical Institute and the Boys’ Secondary School. Amenities for the teaching profession include a club with a library of over 2,000 volumes.

**Roads**

Aden has a total of 140 miles of roads of which approximately 127 miles have a bituminous surface. There are no railways.

**Port**

Vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly and 6,416 with a net registered tonnage of 31,737,645 entered the port during 1964. In addition, the port handled 1,478 country craft with an aggregate net registered tonnage of 137,206.

There are 20 first class berths suitable for ships of from 350 to 800 feet in length. Three of these berths have been modernised by the installation of dolphin mooring facilities. Thirteen of the first class berths are fitted with submarine pipelines for fuelling ships. The 7 second class berths are suitable for ships of about 300 feet in length. There is also an 800 feet long quay with a depth alongside of 18 feet suitable for coasting vessels of up to 2,500 tons gross. Transit and storage sheds on the public wharves provide a total covered space of 400,000 square feet. The approach channel is dredged to 36 feet and three of the largest fuelling berths are dredged to 39 feet. The oil harbour at Little Aden has four jetty berths, the approach channel being dredged to 38 feet and the oil harbour to 40 feet.
Principal Occupations

Of the estimated labour force of 80,000 in employment on 31st December, 1964, 7,500 were engaged directly in the handling of cargo, ship repairing and bunkering activities in the port; 12,500 in the building and construction industry, 13,000 in industrial undertakings, 10,500 in retail and wholesale trades and 18,000 in government service, the police forces and other Services. In addition to 1,500 persons engaged in miscellaneous occupations, there are estimated to be 17,000 domestic servants in employment.

Main Products

There is no agriculture in Aden State.

During 1963 the oil refinery at Little Aden processed 6.32 million tons of crude oil, and in 1964, 6.78 million tons. The products were exported either by tanker or as fuel for ships' bunkers: a small percentage being retained in Aden to meet local demand.

Because of its favourable geographical position and its efficient service to ships, Aden is now one of the two busiest bunkering ports in the world.

There are small factories in Aden which provide a variety of items: soft drinks, reconstituted and packaged powdered milk, aluminium pots and pans, cigarettes, dyed and printed cloth, wooden furniture, bricks, tiles and retreaded tyres. There is a small but flourishing industry for the blending and packing of perfumes, hair oil and toilet waters. Some Aden produce is sold locally and some is exported to neighbouring territories.

PROTECTORATE OF SOUTH ARABIA

(Previously known as the Aden Protectorate)

Area

The total area is approximately 111,000 square miles, including the Island of Socotra. The Protectorate is divided into Western and Eastern Areas.

Population is estimated at:

Western Area .. .. .. 550,000
Eastern Area .. .. .. 318,000

868,000

Towns

There are no large towns in the Western Protectorate but in the Eastern Protectorate Mukalla, the sea port, has a population of about 25,000.

Geographical Features

The Protectorate of South Arabia is bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Yemen, and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.

The Western Protectorate is divided into (a) the litoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges, about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains, over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Empty Quarter with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the litoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys.

The Eastern Protectorate also has a litoral belt, which is backed by a rock plateau rising to a height of 7,000 feet and continuing inland for about 100 miles, where it breaks up into a system of wadis, some fertile, leading into the main Wadi Hadhramaut. Beyond, to the north, are the sands of the Empty Quarter.

Climate

The altitude, which ranges from sea level up to 8,000 feet, is responsible for considerable variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. On the coastal plain torrid tropical conditions of great heat and humidity exist in the summer months (April to October). During the same period in the mid-altitude zones it is hot but less humid, while at the highest altitudes the climate is warm and temperate but dry; in the winter it can be extremely cold. In the Wadi Hadhramaut, although the range of summer temperature is high, the air is dry and far less humid than on the coastal plain. The whole area falls within the influence of the north-east and south-west monsoons. Rainfall in the coastal areas averages approximately two inches a year; in the most favoured areas of the Western Protectorate highlands it may average ten inches; in the coastal areas of the eastern part, on the other hand, rainfall averages approximately two inches a year. In general, rainfall decreases from west to east until, in the north-east section, conditions of extreme aridity are encountered.

History

For a time in the 18th century, the Western Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana’a in the Yemen and several of the rulers of the tribal districts were the Imam’s “wakils” or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with Her Majesty’s Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being in 1954.

The Turks, who had conquered the Yemen in the course of the previous century, signed the Anglo-Turkish Convention respecting the boundaries of Aden in 1914, but, during the first World War, occupied the Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts from July, 1915 until the Armistice in 1918.

In 1934 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Her Majesty’s Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen. There was an Exchange of Notes in 1951 when it was agreed to establish reciprocal diplomatic missions and to set up a Frontier Commission.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa’i Sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dabal) entered into closer relations with Her Majesty’s Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. Treaties were signed by the Upper Aulaqi Sheikh and the Audhali Sultan in 1952, and by the Sheikh of Sha’ib in 1954.
The Wahidi Sultan of Balhaf signed an Advisory Treaty in 1949, and in 1952 the newly elected Sultan of Lahej accepted a political officer as adviser.

In February 1959 six States in the Western Protectorate joined to form the Federation of Arab Amirates of the South, and between October 1959 and 1962 a further five States joined this Federation. In May 1962 this body became known as the Federation of South Arabia (see History of the Federation of South Arabia page 51).

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri Sultans and the rise of the Qa’iti—a new Yafa’i dynasty which gained power and wealth from military and other services rendered by its members abroad to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qa’iti rulers first entered into a treaty with Her Majesty’s Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri Sultan made an agreement with the Qa’iti Sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on him also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qa’iti and Kathiri Sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British Resident Adviser in all matters except those concerning Mohammedan religion and customs. An advisory treaty was signed by the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra in 1954.

Administration

Her Majesty’s Government does not administer the Protectorate directly but the British Advisory Staff advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas.

In the Western Protectorate the States nominate their own heads, who have subsequently to be recognized by Her Majesty’s Government. Not all the heads of the States and tribal chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery and in several States an efficient administration is now functioning.

There are now State Councils in Lower Yafa’i, Dhala, Lower Aulaqi, Sha’ib, Dathina, Beihan, Upper Aulaqi and Wahidi and there are Legislative Councils in Lahej and Fadhli, the latter having elected representatives on the Council. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force called the Government Guards, now known as the Federal Guard, for police duties in the Western Protectorate.

In the Eastern Protectorate the principal States are the Qa’iti and Kathiri which are administered by their Sultans as constitutional rulers and have State Councils. The island of Socotra is linked administratively with the mainland territory of Qishn under the Sultans of Qishn and Socotra. Provincial administration of the Qa’iti and Kathiri States is marked by a well developed system of local government based on town and village councils. Mukalla enjoys municipal elections to its council. Both States maintain efficient technical services of a modern pattern in the fields of health, education and finance.

Public Finance

The following is a summary of Her Majesty’s Government’s expenditure in the Protectorate for the years 1963–64 and 1964–65:

Currency

Aden and the Protectorates, having used East African currency since 1951, changed to a new South Arabian currency, based on the dinar, in April, 1965. The dinar is equivalent to £1 sterling.

Principal Occupations

With the exception of Aden, the people of the Protectorate of South Arabia depend largely on agriculture for their livelihood, cotton, dates and coffee being the most important cash crops.

In the Wadi Hadhramaut, with the assistance of a pump irrigation scheme, large quantities of dates, cotton and wheat are grown.

Livestock are raised with the related industry of preparation of hides and skins as well as dyeing and weaving. The principal occupation of people in the coastal region is fishing.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, sorghum bulrush millet, wheat, barley, sesame and dates; other crops include finger millet, tobacco, lucerne, a wide variety of temperate vegetables, citrus and both tropical and temperate-zone fruit trees.

Long-staple cotton is the major export crop. It was first introduced into the Abyan area in 1949 and is now widely grown. The cotton crop is now expected to produce some 6,500 tons of cotton lint and some 10,500 tons of cotton seed annually to a value of some £3,300,000.

Cotton production figures in statistical bales of 400 lbs cotton lint are:

| Season | Bales |
|--------|-------|
| 1950–51 | 1,587 |
| 1951–52 | 9,890 |
| 1952–53 | 11,161 |
| 1953–54 | 21,736 |
| 1954–55 | 22,140 |
| 1955–56 | 30,700 |
| 1956–57 | 28,310 |
| 1957–58 | 29,000 |
| 1958–59 | 18,806 |
| 1959–60 | 34,524 |
| 1960–61 | 21,554 |
| 1961–62 | 28,000 |
| 1962–63 | 34,700 |
| 1963–64 | 29,104 |
Fruit and vegetables are produced in increasing quantities each year and nearly all are sold in Aden through the Central Wholesale Produce Market. The annual total of fruit and vegetables passing through this market amounts to some 25,000 tons worth up to £532,000.

The annual production of hookah (hamami) tobacco from the Eastern Protectorate is about 700 tons and worth some £210,000; most of it is exported.

The estimated livestock population now that new areas have become subject to census is:

Camels . . . . . . 1,000,000
Cattle . . . . . . 200,000
Goats } . . . . . . 2,500,000
Sheep
Donkeys . . . . . . 50,000

Fisheries

Landings may reach 5,000 tons of which about 2,000 tons is consumed locally, the surplus being sold overseas through a group of exporters in the salt and dried fish trade. Mechanisation of the local fishing boats and improvements in equipment have trebled the local fish consumption from 3,000,000 lbs. in 1959 to 9,000,000 in 1963/64. The increase in landings at fishing villages outside Aden has also helped to steady the local supply. Fishing companies from the U.S.A. are currently engaged in a fisheries survey with the emphasis on sardine production, and regular visitors to the area are large Soviet trawlers and vessels engaged on the International Indian Ocean Expedition.

There has been a 90% changeover to nylon netting and the use of synthetic ropes and floats along the entire coast. Present policy is to develop the Ring net method for enclosing schools of surface fishes of the following types: Kingfish, Indian Mackerel, Indian Longtail Tunny and various types of Jack Mackerel. United Nations Technical Assistance experts have produced useful reports on the methods of developing the fisheries for Yellow Tunny and the marine Crawfish, and a firm from Kenya have exported substantial numbers of the Green Turtle. Cold storage facilities have been provided from C.D. & W. funds and the British Ministry of Overseas Development has assisted in the improvement of the dried fish export trade by supplying a Fish Curing and Quality Control Officer and a Specialist Stored Products Officer on short term assignments to train local Fisheries Department officers in improved techniques.

The Co-operative and Marketing Department has introduced co-operation to the fishermen for fishing requisites in Aden waters and two societies have been formed.

A new Purse Seine type fishing vessel was taken over in Scotland by the staff of the Fisheries Department recently and delivered to Aden under her own power. A series of these Purse Seine vessels are under construction at a local shipyard for introduction into the local inshore fleet, and crews are being trained under a United Nations Fisheries Project during the 1965-68 period.

Co-operative and Marketing

The Co-operative and Marketing Department was established in mid-1955 and started field work towards the end of 1956. It has introduced and spread co-operative ideals and principles mainly among the farmers, fishermen and school students of Aden and the Protectorate of South Arabia.

The following is a list of the Co-operative and Marketing organisations in Aden and the Protectorate:

| Type                                      | Number of Societies |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Cotton Producers’ Associations            | 7                   |
| Co-operative Marketing Societies          | 1                   |
| Farmers’ Co-operative Credit Societies    | 5                   |
| Thrifts and Loans Co-operative Societies  | 2                   |
| School Co-operative Canteens              | 4                   |
| Employees’ Co-operative Canteen (Staff)   | 1                   |
| School Co-operative Thrift Societies      | 49                  |
| Co-operative Pharmacies                   | 3                   |
| Fishermen’s Co-operative Credit Societies | 1                   |
| Fishermen’s Fishing New Supply Co-operative Societies | 1 |

The total membership of these societies is about 19,000.

The Central Wholesale Produce Market, which opened at Khormaksar in November, 1959, is administered by a statutory Marketing Authority under the provisions of the Produce Marketing Ordinance of Aden. Its purpose is to rationalise the wholesale of fruit and vegetables in the interests of both the producers in the Protectorate and the consumers in Aden. It is a self-financing organisation with a turn-over of £1,500,000.

In the Eastern Protectorate the Co-operative Marketing Department has introduced cooperation among fishermen in the Qa’iti State for the marketing of crawfish and turtles and among farmers in the Wadi Hadhramaut for the sale of dates and the rearing of chickens. A number of Societies have also been formed particularly in the pharmaceutical trade, and thrift organisations exist among Junior Secondary and Secondary schools. Cold storage, fumigating and marketing facilities have established an export market for crawfish and for dates.

THE STATES OF THE EASTERN PROTECTORATE

The Eastern Protectorate consists of the Qa’iti Sultanate of Shihir and Mukalla, the Kathiri Sultanate, and the Mahra Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra.

Land Policy

Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenes. The local state governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trusts (waqfs).

Taxation

A small income tax is levied in the Qa’iti and Kathiri States. An import tax tariff is levied on products of every kind except those intended for agricultural or marine use. This tax varies between 17% and 22%. A tax of indigenous origin analogous to a “tithe” is applied to agricultural produce, but it varies with loca.
agricultural conditions and is not an important source of revenue. In some areas, a tax is applied to each fertilised date-palm tree each season.

Rates are collected also by municipalities and councils on market transactions, irrigation pumps, cars, bicycles and wirelesses in most areas.

Development Plans

The Eastern Protectorate Development Plan 1963–68 provides for a total expenditure of £1,744,000 over a five-year period from C.D. & W. sources. Of this sum, £942,564 has been allocated to economic projects; £942,564 to the social services; and £237,670 to communications and public utilities. There is a general reserve of £87,000. Towards these projects the Qa’iti State makes a considerable contribution each year (between £20,000 and £30,000). The education and health services, of necessity, represent the bulk of expenditure (the expenditure on education constitutes by far the largest single head—£634,527—and is almost double any other single service).

The Qa’iti State has allocated a total of £350,000 to its own Development Plan which is dovetailed with the Eastern Protectorate Development Plan. Of this sum, the largest amounts are for education (£90,000), health (£92,000) and roads (£70,000). Water supply and fisheries are other important heads of expenditure. Up to the 31st March, 1963, the state had spent a total of £248,373 (£126,020 in 1962–63). Since 1950, considerable allocations, £153,000, have been made to agricultural development.

Communications

There is no railway in the Eastern Protectorate. The coastal route runs from Reidat Abdal Wadud in the east through Shihir, Mukalla, Wadi Hagr to Bir Ali and Balhaf and on through the Western Protectorate. Roads run inland from Shihir and Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut and from Balhaf to Azzan and Habban. The approximate total mileage of motorable tracks in the Eastern Protectorate is 2,680 miles. The desert between the Wadi Hadhramaut and Beihan is also traversed by motor vehicles. Where these cannot yet penetrate the traffic is carried on camel caravans, which, in large numbers, still travel to Mukalla and Shihir from other parts of the Protectorate. Donkeys are also employed for both passengers and goods. Sea communication along the coast is mainly by dhows, some of which have auxiliary engines. Small powered craft and coastal steamers make occasional and irregular visits to Mukalla and Shihir from Aden, and ocean going vessels of the conventional type call at Mukalla from time to time.

THE STATES OF THE WESTERN PROTECTORATE

The principal States in the Western Protectorate are Abdali (i.e. Lahej), Alawi, Aqrabi, Audhali, Upper Aulaqi, Lower Aulaqi, Aulaqi Sheikdom, Beihan, Dathina, Dhala (including Qutaibi), Fadhli, Haushabi, Lower Yafai, Upper Yafai, Sha’ib and Wahidi.

These, with the five small States in the Upper Yafai area (Bu’si, Dhubhai, Mafiabi, Mausatta, Hadhrami) comprise the States of this part of the Protectorate. All except four of the five States in Upper Yafai (Bu’si, Dhubhai, Mausatta and Hadhrami) are members of the Federation of South Arabia.

Land Policy

Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenes. The local State Governments are in some cases important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trust (waqfs). Land settlement is in progress in the Abyan area.

Public Finance

The latest figures of estimated revenue and expenditure of state administrations which have adopted regular accounting methods are as follows:

| Year    | Expenditure Revenue | Expenditure Revenue |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
|         | £                   | £                   |

| Wahidi Sultanate | 55,334 | 54,715 |
| Haushabi Sultanate | 60,486 | 60,751 |

Communications

The principal towns and villages of the Western Protectorate are linked by a system of undeveloped but motorable roads, suitable for heavy lorries.
and vehicles of the landrover type. Surfaces vary widely from tarmacadam, as yet only in short stretches in the Abyan and Lahej areas relatively close to Aden, to open desert in the north towards Beihan. The principal route eastward from Aden into the Western Protectorate lies for the first forty miles along a sand beach where the going, at low tide, is excellent. For much of the area the principal routes traverse mountain areas following the lines of seasonally filled water courses. There is an ambitious programme of road building, the pace of which is dependent on funds being available. Despite the natural handicaps to easy land communications, the flow of passengers and goods is maintained with rare interruption. Apart from trunk routes which are a Federal responsibility, local routes are maintained by the member States of the Federation from State sources. Donkey and camel caravans are still used.

Regular air services connect Aden with the main centres of population in the Western Protectorate—Dhala, Mukeiras, Beihan, Dathina, Ataq, Mahfid.

Sea communication along the coast is mainly by dhow.

There is no railway.

FEDERATION OF SOUTH ARABIA

Population

The population of the Federation, including Aden, is estimated at 700,000, and the area at 22,000 square miles.

History

On the 11th February, 1959 there was inaugurated a federation of six states in the Western Aden Protectorate, called the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South, and a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and that Federation. The six federated states were the Emirates of Beihan and of Dhala, the Fadhli, Audhali and Lower Yafai Sultanates and the Upper Aulaqi Sheikdom. The treaty extended Her Majesty's protection to the Arab Emirates of the South and provided for military and financial assistance for it. The treaty also contained a provision for the accession of other states to the Federation (see Cmnd 665). The Sultanate of Lahej acceded to the Federation in October, 1959, and three further accessions occurred in February, 1960—the State of Dathina, the Lower Aulaqi Sultanate and the Aqrabi Sheikdom. In April 1962, the Wahidi Sultanate joined the Federation. The Federation of the Arab Emirates of the South became known as the Federation of South Arabia on the 3rd May, 1962. In January, 1963 a treaty was signed providing for the accession of Aden to the Federation and in March of that year the Haushabi Sultanate and the Sha'ib Sheikdom also joined the Federation. In February of 1965 the Upper Aulaqi Sultanate, the Mufahi Sheikdom and the Alawi Sheikdom joined the Federation bringing the total number of member states to 17.

Administration

The legislative body of the Federation is the Federal Council, which consists of 103 members, each state being entitled to be represented by 6 members with the exception of the Aqrabi Sheikdom (1 member), Aden (24) and the Sheikdom of Sha'ib (3) the Mufahi Sheikdom (2) and the Alawi Sheikdom (1). Each state is free to select its representatives to the Federal Council by whatever means it considers appropriate.

The executive of the Federation is the Supreme Council consisting of 17 Ministers elected by and from Members of the Federal Council for a period of office not exceeding 5 years. The chairmanship of the Supreme Council is held by Ministers in rotation.

For internal security within the Federation, the Government Guards and the Tribal Guards of the Federated States have now been amalgamated into one force known as the Federal Guard. The Federal Minister of Internal Security is responsible to the Supreme Council for the control of this force.

In November, 1961, the Aden Protectorate Levies became part of the Federal Army which constitutes the defence force of the Federation.

Taxation

The levying and collection of customs dues is a federal responsibility and receipts from customs dues represent the largest individual item in the federal revenue. An economic milestone was passed in April, 1963 with the abolition of customs dues inside the Federation and the establishment of a South Arabian "common market." The full effects of this revolutionary change will not be felt for some little time, but already trade is flowing more freely throughout the Federation. The purchasing power of those living in the interior is being increased, which in its turn will mean that there will be more money available for purchase in the shops of the Federation and for imports coming to the port of Aden.

Only public officers pay income tax and they are assessed on the same basis as individuals in Aden State.

Taxes are levied on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and manufactures thereof, non-potable alcoholic mixtures, qat, aerated waters and petroleum products.

Public Finance

The revenue and expenditure figures for the Federation of South Arabia for the period 1960-1965 are:

| Year   | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| 1960/61 | 1,462,851  | 1,183,015      |
| 1961/62 | 1,522,264  | 1,545,578      |
| 1962/63 | 3,734,530  | 3,697,868      |
| 1963/64 | 8,596,637  | 8,238,981      |
| 1964/65 | 9,041,988  | 7,305,364      |

Development

The Federal Government is engaged in implementing a development plan which is not yet completed but which will cover education, agriculture, fisheries, communications, health, marketing and information services.

The Federation, which is an administering authority for C.D. & W. Schemes, has been allocated £4,170,000 from C.D. & W. Funds for the period 1963-66.

In the past the largest development scheme has been that in Abyan; this was initiated in 1947 with the aim of achieving a better use of land and water resources and has developed at a satisfactory rate in all fields, where adequate staff, machinery and materials could be mustered. The scheme is
administered by the Abyan Board, which consists of representatives of the two States in the Abyan area, with government advice available, and which works in partnership with landowners and owner-occupiers or tenant farmers. Cotton is grown as a main crop and marketed by the Board. An area of approximately 68,000 acres is now controlled for irrigation farming out of an estimated gross area of 120,000 acres.

Education

The Federal Ministry of Education at present covers 14 states. The system of education, which is the same in all states, comprises 4 years primary, 3 years intermediate and 4 years secondary education, followed by—in Aden State only—2 years of senior secondary education leading to G.C.E ‘A’ level examinations. The range of development is great, ranging from states which have not yet established their own intermediate schools, to Aden State which, educationally, is much more advanced than other members of the Federation.

In Aden State, primary and intermediate education is provided free for Adeni boys and girls, while moderate fees are charged for secondary education, although remission is granted in cases of financial hardship; allowances are made to teachers in training, and generous grants towards capital and recurrent expenditure are made to grant-aided schools. Primary education begins at 7 years of age, and provision is made for over 13,000 pupils at 21 government, 12 grant-aided and 5 private schools. Intermediate education is provided for almost 7,000 pupils at 23 schools, 8 of which are government, 10 grant-aided and 5 private. At secondary level there are 4 government schools for boys and one for girls, while 5 grant-aided and 3 private schools also have secondary sections, providing in all for 2,500 pupils. The government Technical Institute at Ma'alla provides technical and vocational training for 800 students, and courses are held in engineering, building and commerce leading to the examinations of the City and Guilds of London Institute and of the Royal Society of Arts, to the Ordinary Certificate in Building or Engineering, and to the General Certificate of Education at ‘O’ level. There are two teacher training centres, one for men and one for women, with a total of approximately 100 places.

Adult education is provided by part-time and evening classes, by Arabic language classes for non-Arabs and by practical classes in housecraft for women.

During the past twenty years, the money provided for education in Aden State has increased a hundredfold, and is now in the region of £750,000 per annum. The current development plan envisages the establishment of 7 new primary, 7 new intermediate and 2 new secondary schools by 1969.

In the remaining 13 states of the Federation, there are 119 primary schools for boys (12,221 pupils) and 13 for girls (1,311 pupils). Intermediate education is provided in 10 boys’ schools for 1,430 pupils and in 2 for girls with a total of 66 pupils. The Boys’ Secondary School which has just entered its second year has 105 pupils on roll, and a new Men’s Teacher Training Centre opened in 1964 with 38 students.

The Federal Ministry of Education also undertakes the administration of the Overseas Scholarships Board and there is a Students’ Liaison Office in London with full-time staff. Of some seventy students at present pursuing courses of advanced study overseas, approximately three-quarters are in the United Kingdom. The Student Liaison Officer also looks after private sponsored students in the United Kingdom.

Health

The Federal Ministry of Health contains three main divisions—Curative, Port Health and School Health.

The Curative Services are based on the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, two maternity clinics, three rural hospitals, five general dispensaries and over forty health units. The latter are satellites of the rural hospitals. Specialist facilities for surgery, medicine, ophthalmology, oto-rhino-laryngology and dermatology are based on the main general hospital in Aden. A mental hospital and infectious diseases hospital are now being constructed and work has already commenced on rural hospitals at Said (Aulaqi) and Azzan (Wahidi). Many new health centres are to be built in the near future.

The following hospital beds are available:

| Hospital/Unit                        | Beds |
|-------------------------------------|------|
| Queen Elizabeth Hospital            | 495  |
| Maternity Clinic, Crater            | 84   |
| Maternity Clinic, Sheikh Othman     | 20   |
| Home for Aged Persons               | 56   |
| Rural Hospitals                     | 165  |
| Keith Faulkner Hospital             | 40   |
| (Church of Scotland)                |      |
| BP Refinery Hospital                | 130  |

In 1964, the following number of patients attended Government institutions:

| Hospital/Unit                        | In-Patients | Out-Patients |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
|                                     | New Cases   | Treatments   |
| Queen Elizabeth Hospital            | 7,717       | 39,867       | 19,787       |
| Maternity Clinic                    | 6,519       | 29,211       | —            |
| Rural Hospitals                     | 3,604       | 132,904      | 253,637      |
| Dispensaries                        | —           | 343,106      | 558,883      |
| Health Units, Other States          | —           | 228,472      | 391,023      |
| Seamen's Clinics (2)                | —           | 5,363        | —            |

In the State of Aden, public health is under the control of the Aden Municipality and the Township Authorities of Sheikh Othman and Little Aden. In the rural areas, public health comes under the State Councils and small township authorities. In 1962 surveys were carried out in the fields of malaria, bilharzia and malnutrition. Malaria control is now being organised on a pre-eradication basis but the eventual eradication depends on the co-operation of neighbouring territories.

The estimates of the Ministry of Health for 1965–66 show a total expenditure of £1,131,373.

Civil Aviation

Civil aviation matters in the Federation, aerodromes and ancillary services, including the safety of aircraft, are the concern of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Shipping and Navigation.

The main civil air terminal is at Khormaksar in Aden, some 7 miles from the seaport. The aerodrome lies across the isthmus between the upper
reaches of the inner harbour and the shore of the Gulf of Aden. It is used jointly by the Royal Air Force and the Department of Civil Aviation who, between them, provide the common user navigational services. The main runway, which is 10 feet above sea level, is bitumenised, 8,386 feet long, and can be used by the heaviest modern aircraft.

Ten airlines operate to and through the airport: Aden Airways, Air India International, Alitalia, B.O.A.C., East African Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Middle East Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Sudan Airways and United Arab Airlines. Many of these airlines use Comet, Boeing 707 or V.C.10 aircraft.

The local airline is Aden Airways (a subsidiary of B.O.A.C.) and with a fleet of six DC3 and two Viscount aircraft, it operates a domestic network of regular services to destinations in the Federation and the Protectorate as well as scheduled services on international trunk routes to East Africa, Ethiopia, the Somali Republic, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Bahrein and Egypt.

Broadcasting

The South Arabian Broadcasting Service transmits for 11 hours daily in Arabic with 7½ kW on 5060 kc/s and 5 kW on 785 kc/s. A 50 kW transmitter, financed from C.D. & W. funds is now under construction, and will greatly increase the reception range. There are about 200,000 receivers in the Federation and the number is increasing all the time. There are daily broadcasts in English on networks operated by the British Forces Broadcasting Service and the voluntary Aden Forces Broadcasting Association. Primarily for Service personnel and families in the Middle East Command, these broadcasts provide popular programmes complementary to those put out in Arabic by S.A.B.S.

The South Arabian Broadcasting Service introduced television in September 1964. At the moment it normally broadcasts for 2½ hours a day, but it is intended to increase the period of transmission. Reception is confined to Aden State and the neighbouring parts of Lahej at present.

Trade

The principal imports are crude oil, grain, rice, flour, sugar, dates, edible oils, oil seeds, tea, textiles, cotton and rayon piece goods, manufactured tobacco, cement, household requirements, sheep and goats and qat.

The only significant exports are refined petroleum products, cotton and cottonseed.

In addition to being the Federation's main port for imports and exports, Aden has a transhipment and entrepôt trade with surrounding territories. Besides traditional trade in gums and resins, incense, spices, oils, tobacco and shells and a valuable tourist trade in luxury goods such as binoculars, cameras, watches, wireless sets and cosmetics, there is a large re-export trade handling rice, sugar, tea, manufactured tobacco, textiles and piece goods and a wide range of manufactured articles and consumer goods.

The Federation's value of trade (excluding bullion and specie) in 1964 was £180·4 million. A comparison with the 1961 and 1962 figures for Aden, corrected by deleting trade with the Western Protectorate, is:

| Year | Imports £ millions | Exports £ millions | Total £ millions |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 1961 | 80·7              | 62·5               | 143·2            |
| 1962 | 83·9              | 64·0               | 147·9            |
| 1963 | 97·0              | 69·6               | 166·6            |
| 1964 | 106·1             | 74·3               | 180·4            |

THE ISLANDS

KAMARAN

The island of Kamaran (area 70 square miles) is in the Red Sea and has been in British occupation since 1915. The High Commissioner for Aden and the Protectorate of South Arabia has direct legislative powers over the island under the Kamaran Order in Council, 1963, and the Kamaran Royal Instructions, 1963. The island is administered by the Commissioner. Until 1953 Kamaran was a quarantine station for pilgrims on their way to Jeddah by sea. Expenditure on the administration of Kamaran in 1963–64 was £41,753.

PERIM

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799, the British took formal possession but evacuated the island the same year. It was reoccupied by the British in January, 1851, and was later used as a coaling station.

The Perim Order in Council, 1963, and the Perim Royal Instructions, 1963, vest the High Commissioner for Aden and the Protectorate of South Arabia with legislative powers, and the island is administered by a Commissioner. Expenditure on the administration of Perim in 1963–64 was £19,925.

KURIA MURIA

The five Kuria Muria Islands were ceded to Queen Victoria in 1854 by the Sultan of Muscat. The Kuria Muria Islands Order in Council, 1963, and the Kuria Muria Islands Royal Instructions, 1963, vest the High Commissioner of Aden and the Protectorate of South Arabia with legislative powers over the islands but administration is carried out by the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.
