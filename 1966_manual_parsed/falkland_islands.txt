FALKLAND ISLANDS AND DEPENDENCIES

Area

The Falkland Islands, situated in the South Atlantic, lie some 480 miles north-east of Cape Horn. The numerous islands of which they are composed cover 4,700 square miles. The Dependencies now consist of only South Georgia, 800 miles east-south-east of the Falklands, and the South Sandwich Group, some 470 miles south-east of South Georgia. Those territories south of latitude 60°S which were formerly part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies, namely, the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands, and the Antarctic Peninsula together with the sector of the Antarctic Continent lying between longitude 20°W and 80°W were constituted a separate Colony on 3rd March 1962 under the name of the British Antarctic Territory. (See page 82.)

Population

At the 31st December 1964, the population, excluding the Dependencies, was 2,102, there being rather more males than females. With few exceptions all were of European descent and most were British. The population of the Dependencies at 31st December 1964, was 499.

Principal Town

Stanley, the capital (population 1,074 at 1962 census), is the only town. In the Camp, the countryside other than Stanley, the largest settlement is at Goose Green on the East Falkland where there are some 100 residents.

Geographical Features

There are two large islands, the East and West Falklands, and numerous smaller islands. The coastline is deeply indented and affords several good anchorages. The surface everywhere, except in Lafonia, is hilly, the maximum height being reached in the East Falkland where Mount Usborne rises to 2,312 feet. There are no large inland waters. A feature of the treeless, moorland scenery is the "stone runs", long "rivers" of angular, quartzite boulders. The island of South Georgia in the Dependencies is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, and the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea.

Climate

The islands are in the same latitude south as London is north, but apart from hours of sunshine which are similar, there are marked climatic differences. The main feature of the Falklands' weather is the strong wind which blows throughout the year, and which some people from Britain find trying. Climatic figures for Stanley are:

- Mean annual temperature: around 42°F.
- Mean annual wind speed: around 17 knots.
- Mean annual rainfall: around 25 inches.
- Annual maximum temperature: around 70°F.
- Annual minimum temperature: around 22°F.
The Dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

History

The Falklands are said to have been discovered by Davis in 1592 and were evidently visited by Hawkins in 1594. On the other hand it is claimed by some historians that Vespucci sighted the Falklands in 1502. In 1764 de Bougainville established a small colony at Port Louis in the East Falkland. This French settlement was handed over to Spain in 1767 on the payment of a sum said to have amounted to £24,000. In 1765 Captain Byron took possession of the West Falkland and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. This action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the settlement to the British in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774. The Spaniards also abandoned their settlement at Soledad (Port Louis) in the early nineteenth century.

In 1820 the Captaincy-General of Buenos Aires established a settlement at Soledad which was destroyed in 1831 by the U.S. warship Lexington as a reprisal for interference with American sealers.

In 1833 the occupation of the Islands was resumed by the British Government. In 1841 a civil Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, who took over the following year from the naval officer then in charge of the Islands. In 1843 an Act of Parliament placed the civil administration on a permanent footing and the Lieutenant-Governor's title was changed to Governor. In 1844, following a decision taken the previous year, the seat of government was removed from Port Louis to Port William, where the settlement was named Stanley.

A grant-in-aid of the Colony was approved in 1841 and continued until 1880. A grant-in-aid for a mail service continued until 1884-85, since which year the Colony has been self-supporting. The development of the Colony has been closely linked with the growth of the Falkland Islands Company, the largest landowner and trading company, formed in 1851.

Of the Dependencies, South Georgia was probably discovered by the London merchant de la Roché in 1675 and formally annexed in 1775 by Captain Cook who in the same year discovered and took possession of the South Sandwich group.

An Administrative Officer and official staff reside at King Edward Point, South Georgia, where there has been a Government Station since 1909.

Constitution

The Government is administered by a Governor aided by an Executive Council which is composed of two ex-officio members, two unofficial members appointed by the Governor and two elected members of the Legislative Council elected by that Council's elected and independent members, and a Legislative Council composed of two ex-officio members, two nominated independent members and four elected members.

There is a Town Council for Stanley.

A Court of Appeal was set up on the 1st July 1965, to hear and determine appeals from the Courts of the Colony of the Falkland Islands and the Dependencies of the Colony.

Land Policy

All the land is held freehold and mostly by a very few large farms. Certain areas are Crown reserves.

Taxation

Direct taxation is in the form of income tax, individuals paying a graduated tax ranging from 1s. in every £ of the first £100 of taxable income to 5s. 9d. in every £ exceeding £6,000. Companies pay a flat rate of 5s. 9d. in the £. A profits tax, levied at either 1s. 6d. or 2s. in the £ for incorporated and unincorporated bodies, was introduced in the 1963 tax year and is payable in addition to income tax. Arrangements have been concluded with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Mexico and the United States of America for the avoidance of double taxation.

There is no general Customs tariff, import duties being confined to liquor, tobacco and matches. During 1962, following a revision in the tax system, export duties on wool, tallow, hide and skins, were not payable. Duty remained payable on whale and seal oil, and on other whale and seal products.

Currency
The currency is British coinage and local £5, £1 and 10s. notes which are interchangeable with sterling at par.

Education
In 1964 there were 324 children receiving education in the Colony. There is no system of higher education and no advanced secondary education. In Stanley the Government schools cater adequately for children between the ages of five and fourteen though a number stay until their sixteenth year and, in some subjects, reach General Certificate of Education standard. Outside Stanley, education is carried on either in settlement schools, some of which are very small, or by itinerant teachers. A boarding school opened in 1956 at Darwin on the East Falkland accommodates 39 boarders and caters for as many day pupils as may wish to attend. In 1957 a school was opened at Port Howard on the West Falkland, catering for boarders and the children of Port Howard as day pupils, but reverted to a full time settlement school in May 1963, owing to lack of local support. Attendance at school is compulsory in Stanley, where there are boarding or settlement schools, and where itinerant teachers call. In 1964 a maximum of 8 travelling teachers were employed among the 96 children outside Stanley, Darwin and settlement schools. Education is free except at Darwin Boarding School where a boarding fee of £12 a year is levied.

The Colony awards up to two scholarships annually to boarding schools in Dorset, tenable by children with primarily Falkland Island parents. Seven scholars are in England at present.

Estimated ordinary expenditure on education for the Colony for 1964-65 was £45,540.

Libraries
There is one lending library in Stanley operated by the Town Council. A Camp Library Scheme was inaugurated in 1961 and is a postal service designed to bring library facilities to residents outside Stanley.

Health
The commoner ailments in the Colony are the common cold, naso-pharyngitis, bronchitis, gastro-enteritis and rheumatism in its chronic form.

There is one General Hospital in Stanley. An extension to the hospital, the Churchill Wing, was completed in 1953. The Colony now has a modern, well-equipped hospital, with 32 beds.

The Government Medical Department employs one Senior Medical Officer and three Medical Officers, one of whom is in Stanley, one at Darwin in Lafonia and the third at Fox Bay, in the West Falkland. A Tuberculosis Officer was employed from September 1953 to November 1954 on a tuberculosis survey of the Falklands. An ophthalmic specialist was engaged from July 1959 to March 1960 on an ophthalmic survey of the islands. The nursing staff of the Hospital consists of the Matron, three Nursing Sisters and three Nurses.

There are two Government-employed dentists and a dental technician in the Colony.

The Government Air Service is used extensively for medical transport to and from Stanley. The m.v. Philomel is also at the disposal of the Medical Department for use when the weather does not permit the use of the aircraft.

Total estimated expenditure on the Medical Department in 1964-65 was £39,079. In 1935 the sum spent was £5,225.

Communications
Communication between the Colony and the mainland of South America is maintained by the Falkland Islands Company's vessel R.M.S. Darwin which runs a mail and passenger service at least 12 times a year to Montevideo. Internal communications are maintained by sea with the Government-owned Philomel, the Darwin and a few small private vessels. There is also a small Government-owned air service. Travellers generally use horses when moving from one settlement to another on the mainland. South Georgia is served by vessels in the whaling industry and the Royal Research Ships John Biscoe and Shackleton call there and elsewhere in the Dependencies during the southern summer. There are no roads, except in Stanley, although rough unsurfaced tracks connect most settlements on the main East and West Islands, and travel is possible by means of Land Rover or motor-cycle, depending on weather conditions. There is no inland waterway or rail service.

Broadcasting
The Government runs a broadcasting station at Stanley, operating on 536 and 3,958 kc/s, with a power of 5 kW and 500 watts respectively. In 1964 there were 565 wireless licence holders in the Colony. Government also operates a wired broadcasting service in Stanley which in 1964 had 348 subscribers. There is also a Government wireless station on the West Falkland to which most of the farms are linked by telephone. The East Falkland has telephone facilities similar to those on the West. Government operates an inter-island radio-telephone service and daily communication is maintained with Stanley.

Principal Occupations
In the Camp the main occupation is sheep-farming. In Stanley the population is employed on Government and public services, trading and shipping. The population is almost equally divided between Stanley and the Camp. Local labour is organized in the Falkland Islands Labour Federation which has a 90% membership of eligible labour.

Main Crops and Products
There is no agriculture in the Colony other than a very small acreage of oats grown for hay. Householders in Stanley and the Camp grow their own vegetables. There are no minerals and the only manufactured product is a small quantity of tallow. The principal products are wool from the Colony, whale meal, whale oil, other whale products and seal oil from the Dependencies.
