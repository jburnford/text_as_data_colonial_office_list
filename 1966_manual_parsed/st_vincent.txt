ST. VINCENT

Area

The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population

The population at the 1960 (April) Census was 79,948, and was estimated at the end of 1964 to be 87,000.

Principal Town

Kingstown, the capital, has a population of 20,688 including suburbs.

Geographical Features

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufrière (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 70 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At the Kingstown station, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 82·6°F and the rainfall 89·11 inches, in 1962.

History

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent, and inter-married with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British fourteen years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and...
St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in 1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

**Constitution**

The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 55) except that provision is made for nine elected members in the Legislative Council.

**Taxation**

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 65 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 40 cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 18s. 2d. per proof gallon.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Medical: $877,206
- Education: $1,112,750

The Public debt at 31st December 1964 was $1,817,390 equivalent to $22.72 per head of the population.

A Loan of £315,000 in 6½% Stock 1974/96 was raised by the Crown Agents for Overseas Governments and Administrations in July 1963 on behalf of this Government, to be applied to projects in St. Vincent's Development Plan 1955/64.

These projects included (a) the Construction of a Deep Water Harbour, (b) Acquisition of an Arrowroot Factory at Biabou (c) Establishment of a Central Arrowroot Factory and (d) A New Market in Kingstown.

**Development Plans**

A Development Programme for the period 1963 to 1966 was approved in 1964 and provides for total expenditure of $3,806,039. The allocation of this sum is as follows:

| Item                        | Amount |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture                 | 408,526|
| Industrial Development      | 431,396|
| Education                   | 593,403|
| Medical and Health          | 201,214|
| Housing                     | 60,000 |
| Communications and Works    | 2,111,500|
| **Total**                   | **3,806,039**|

The major proposals to be undertaken during the period of the programme are:

- School Building: $415,300
- Training of Teachers: $100,000
- Improvement Water Supplies: $495,000
- Road Development—St. Vincent Grenadines: $730,000
- New Automatic Telephone System: $150,000
- Housing: $60,000

A new Development Plan for the period 1966 to 1970 is currently being prepared.

**Education**

In 1964 there were two Government secondary schools and seven grant-aided secondary schools with an enrolment of 1,930 pupils and 56 primary schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 24,609 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions. Four Government teacher-training establishments have a total enrolment of 180 pupils. A Government Teacher Training College was opened in October 1964 with 29 students.

During 1963–64 some 50 St. Vincent students were attending universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1964 expenditure on educational services amounted to $1,066,932. In 1935 expenditure was $52,642.

**Health**

Yaws is no longer a public health problem, prompt measures are taken to control individual cases and any sporadic outbreaks. The work of arresting the spread of Tuberculosis progressed with intensified contact finding and follow-up of cured cases. Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 24 dispensaries. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery): 210
- Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases: 48
- Mental: 100
- Leprosy: 20
- Pauper Home: 125

In 1964 in-patients numbered 4,756; out-patients, 6,936.

Total expenditure in 1964 on Government Health and Medical Services was $873,788; in 1935 $66,945.

**Communications**

There are present in St. Vincent 145 miles of all-weather roads, 202·45 miles of rough motorable and 206·5 miles of tracks and bye-ways.

The seadrome at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown, is no longer in operation. A land aerodrome with a single runway—4,800 feet × 150 feet—in a strip width of 500 feet, has been constructed at Arnos Vale Airport, two miles south-west of Kingstown.

The Terminal Building was officially opened in October 1961, and was put into immediate operation.

Scheduled services are operated by Leeward Islands Air Transport and British West Indian
Airways, using AVRO 748 and Viscount aircrafts respectively.

At present, LIAT operates a six times weekly service in both directions, linking Antigua/Guadeloupe/Dominica/Martinique/St. Lucia/St. Vincent and Barbados.

The present BWIA schedule is four times weekly, also in both directions, linking Trinidad/Grenada/Barbados and St. Vincent.

The chief port is Kingstown. A weekly cargo and passenger service is provided by two ships travelling alternately via the islands as far north as Jamaica and south to Trinidad. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service monthly by the Harrison Line. Geest Industries Steamships call weekly taking shipments of bananas and a limited number of passengers to the United Kingdom. Monthly cargo and passenger services are provided by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Co., Booth American Shipping Co., Fratelli Grimaldi Line, James Nourse Line, Harrison Line, Atlantic Line, West India Shipping Co., Linea C Line, Saguenay Shipping, Ltd. and Blue Ribbon Line.

Motor vessels and schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

Motor launches and open boats ply daily between ports on the Leeward coasts and Kingstown. Between the Grenadines and the mainland communication and transport are provided by auxiliary sailing vessels and a tri-weekly motor vessel service on Government Contract.

The new harbour facilities for the port of Kingstown were completed in 1964. This new wharf is of open piled construction 900 feet in length parallel to the shore—125 feet off a filled area of 300 feet by 600 feet in size—a vehicle approach 25 feet wide and two walkway approaches each 10 feet wide.

The main wharfhead is 40 feet wide.

Provision has been made for fresh water connections on the wharf and adequate warehousing and open storage facilities have been provided adjacent to it. It accommodates ships drawing up to 30 feet of water.

Broadcasting

(See under Grenada—page 116.)

There is a sub-station in St. Vincent which for the greater part relays the programmes of the Main W.I.B.S. Station in St. George's, Grenada.

However, time is allowed for local programmes usually of ½ hour duration and these are produced and broadcast from the Kingstown Studio.

For important local programmes more time may be used according to the discretion of the Programme Assistant.

A new Transmitter Station went into operation during August 1964 with a power output of 500 watts. Designed to give island-wide coverage, the two 250 watt transmitters—working in parallel—replaced the original 20 watt transmitter which served only Kingstown and its environs. The local programmes from the latter transmitter were audible only within a radius of about 9 miles.

St. Vincent's contribution for 1964 for running and maintaining the Windward Islands Broadcasting Service was $25,250.

Principal Occupations

The working population is estimated to be some 30,000, about 50% of whom are engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.

Trade Unions

The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers' Union . . . (not available)
The Civil Service Association . . . 316
The Teachers' Association . . . 475
The Secondary School Teachers' Association . . . (not available)

Main Crops and Products

The main crops in order of importance are bananas, arrowroot, copra, cotton, sweet potatoes, nutmegs and mace, peanuts, starchy food crops, cocoa and cassava.

The livestock population based on the 1961 census was: asses 1,300; cattle 6,900; sheep 5,000; goats 6,100; pigs 5,100; poultry (all types) 55,000.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

Extensive fishing is done in-shore but very little off-shore. A fisheries scheme has started under which cold storage facilities have been provided. This is situated in Canouan and has led to greatly increased activity particularly in the well stocked fishing waters of the Grenadines.

The one modern Central Arrowroot Factory is operating. There are some 14 other privately owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a cigarette factory; rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks.

The Government Cotton Ginney has been rebuilt. It has two gins with room for a third, and a bale press also. Operations recommenced towards the end of 1965. There is a tyre recapping factory at Arnos Vale.

In 1938 43% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 36% from other Commonwealth countries and 21% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1964 were: 28, 38 and 34.

In 1938 40% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 22% to other Commonwealth countries and 38% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1964 were: 60, 27 and 13.

Principal Exports by Quantity and Value ($ B.W.I.)

| Item       | 1938 | 1963 | 1964 |
|------------|------|------|------|
| Bananas    | tons | 1,300| 25,193| 25,051|
| Arrowroot  | tons | 3,651| 3,203| 2,592|

The chief imports are foodstuffs, cotton piece-goods, cement, timber, motor spirit, fertilisers and motor vehicles.

Marketing and Co-operative Organisations

At the end of 1964 there were 16 registered Co-operative Societies with a membership of 1,784 classified as follows: 8 Credit Unions, 3 Marketing Societies, 4 Fishermen’s Societies and 1 Thrift and Credit. These societies have savings amounting to $69,903 and assets totalling $95,554. Loans granted to members in 1964 amounted to $56,841 and repayments totalled $31,898.

The impact of these societies on the economic life of the people is gradually being felt and it is hoped that with increased co-operative education and techniques greater economic and social improvements will result.

The 26 Agricultural Credit Societies which cooperate under the Agricultural Credit Societies Ordinance cater to peasant farmers solely. Membership remained at 1,281. In 1963 three societies received loans totalling $19,255. Emphasis continued on the collection of amounts due. As at end of 1964 the total amount outstanding was $150,268-40, a decrease of $19,665.

A Statutory Marketing Board has been established to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchasing, handling, storage, exportation, shipping and marketing of all specified produce of St. Vincent, provided that this shall not apply to produce, the marketing of which is already under the control of some other Statutory Authority. At present under the provisions of the Marketing Board Ordinance, 1959, only sweet potatoes have been declared a “specified product”. The Board will eventually deal with the majority of crops but it is proposed to proceed cautiously, making a start with sweet potatoes only, and “specifying” other items gradually in the light of experience.
