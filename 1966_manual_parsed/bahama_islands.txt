BAHAMA ISLANDS

Area, etc.

The total land area of the Colony is 4,404 square miles. It is separated on the west from Florida by the Straits of Florida and on the south from Cuba by the Old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.

Population

The population at the end of 1964 was estimated at 138,149. English is universally spoken.

Principal Town

Nassau, the capital, is the chief port and the only town of any size. It is situated on the island of New Providence, the population of which is estimated to be 83,837.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of an archipelago of about 700 islands, of which only 30 are inhabited, and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are generally long, narrow and low-lying and are of aeolian limestone formation. The soil, except in small pockets, is shallow and overlays hard rock. On the whole, it is suitable only for peasant farming. Conditions are sub-tropical. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahama, where there are extensive pine forests.

Climate

The winter climate is delightful. Frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70°, the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. In July, August and September the heat ranges from 80° to 90° and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the Colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating, though this is mitigated in modern days by air conditioning. Although the customarily recognised season when the majority of visitors come to the Bahamas is in the winter, there is a growing number of persons who prefer the summer months because of the opportunities for swimming, sailing and fishing.
The rainfall averages about 40 inches a year. The rainy months are May, June, September and October.

History

San Salvador, one of the islands composing the Colony, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Arawak inhabitants were transported to work in the Hispaniola mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had settlements on any of the islands of the group at any time. In 1649 Parliament, on the petition of William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands" which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding an earlier Royal Grant in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles II in 1670 granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. Before the 1670 Grant the inhabitants of the islands had organized the settlement and instituted a form of government, which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected their Governor. His appointment was later confirmed by the Lords Proprietors and a regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown in 1717.

The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1686 that the settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica. By 1703 it had reached some importance, when it was almost annihilated by the French and Spaniards. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned once more. The islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place; since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1782, but were re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux and British possession was confirmed by the Peace of Versailles, 1783. After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas group and received substantial assistance from England, and in 1787 the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

The constitution of the Bahamas was eventually settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. The government was modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected House of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.

Up to January, 1964, representative, but not responsible government existed. The executive government was in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who had the power of veto, and was advised by an Executive Council of not more than nine members of whom six were unofficials. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation were vested by law in the Governor in Council. A Legislative Council was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841; and in 1963 it consisted of eleven members nominated by the Crown, of whom nine were unofficials.

The General Assembly Elections Act of 1959 provided for, inter alia, adult male suffrage, and a limited second vote in respect of ownership and/or rental of real property, the latter to be exercised only in a constituency other than that in which the elector resided. The Act also provided for the creation of two additional seats for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New Providence and the redistribution of the New Providence seats after by-elections to fill the new seats. Accordingly from 1960 the House of Assembly was composed of 33 members.

A law was promulgated with effect from mid-1962 extending the franchise to women and making women eligible for election to seats in the House of Assembly.

Constitution and Administration

At the Bahamas Constitutional Conference held in London in May, 1963, the Secretary of State agreed to further constitutional changes. These were embodied in a new Constitution which came into effect on the 7th January 1964, giving the territory full internal self-government.

The bicameral Legislature has been reconstituted to consist of an Upper House called the Senate and a Lower House called the House of Assembly.

The Senate consists of fifteen members of whom eight are appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Premier and such other persons as he may in his discretion decide to consult, five by the Governor on the advice of the Premier, and two by the Governor on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition.

The House of Assembly remains unchanged until it is dissolved in the ordinary course. Thereafter the House of Assembly will consist of thirty-eight elected members, of whom not less than eighteen nor more than twenty-two members will represent Out Island constituencies, and not less than sixteen nor more than twenty members will represent New Providence constituencies. The next General Election will be contested on the basis of twenty-one seats for the Out Islands and seventeen for New Providence.

The Cabinet consists of a Premier and fourteen Ministers. The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears to him to be best able to command a majority in the House of Assembly. The remaining Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier.

Land Policy

The Status of Aliens Act Ch. 180 empowers an alien to acquire and hold property within the Colony.

Taxation

There is no income tax. Excise tax is charged on spirits and beer locally produced at the rate of four-fifths (4/5) of the import duty imposed on the particular kind of spirit or beer. The general Customs duty is 20% ad valorem plus 7½% ad valorem Emergency Tax. Staple foodstuffs pay a low specific duty and no Emergency Tax; spirits and tobacco are taxed at higher rates than the general and gasoline pays a specific duty with additional sales tax. Preferential margins are designed to implement the Ottawa and Anglo-American Trade Agreements.
Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1960 | 7,988,620  | 8,337,188       |
| 1961 | 8,563,582  | 8,574,914       |
| 1962 | 8,689,155  | 9,042,292       |
| 1963 | 9,599,255  | 9,834,388       |
| 1964 | 12,163,983 | 11,841,916      |

The main sources of revenue are Customs dues and receipts from fees, Post Office, Licences and public utilities. In 1964 £6,875,588 of the revenue was derived from import duties. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

Contributions and Charitable Grants (£1,385,775), Ministry of Education (£1,163,647), Ministry of Health (£1,209,501), Ministry of Tourism (£1,233,656) and Ministry of Works (£907,169).

In December 1964 the outstanding amount of the authorized Public Debt was £2,426,151.

Currency

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States and Canadian currencies are also generally accepted in the Colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government. Accounts are kept in sterling. Notice has been given, however, of the intention to introduce decimal currency shortly. There are branch banks of the Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Bank of Commerce, Barclays Bank, D.C. and O., Bank of London and Montreal, First National City Bank of New York, Wellington Bank of Canada, Ltd., and Chase Manhattan Bank in Nassau.

Development

Freeport is a booming holiday resort with diversified light industrial activity on Grand Bahama Island, third largest island in the Bahama Islands, 76 miles from Palm Beach and 120 miles from Miami.

The founder of Freeport is Wallace Groves, American lawyer-financier who formed the Grand Bahama Port Authority, Ltd., to negotiate the "Hawksbill Creek Agreement" with the Bahamas Government.

Among the Agreement's provisions is one stating that no real property taxes will be imposed until at least 1990; also that until that year, the Port Authority and its licensees will be free from Personal Property, Capital Gains and Capital Appreciation Taxes. The same applies to Authority and Licensee's earnings and the earnings and bonuses of their employees. The Agreement also provided that a harbour should be constructed before the Agreement could be ratified and an amendment to the Agreement had a condition that a luxury hotel should be completed by the end of 1963. The result of the vision behind the Agreement and the subsequent enterprise has been the unprecedented growth of a boom town in the sunshine.

A deep-water harbour enables Miami-Nassau cruise ships to make Freeport a Port of Call. The Freeport Bunkering Company, Ltd., refuels ships through underwater lines so that they are neither required to enter port nor pay port fees, taxes, duties or surcharges found at U.S. Bunkering Ports.

The largest single investment is the over $50 million plant of the Bahamas Cement Company, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Steel which began operations in December 1964.

The Freeport International Airport was completely modernized in 1964. A jet runway has been completed.

Adjacent to Freeport is the resort of Lucaya. The lavish new Lucayan Beach Hotel and Casino have nearby an 18-hole championship golf course designed by the late Dick Wilson and an ultra-modern marina and boatel. Sometimes referred to as the "New World Riviera", it is a tourist centre second only to Nassau.

Shipping magnate D. K. Ludwig is building a resort complex around his recently opened King's Inn and golf clubs. The Holiday Inn chain opened a 500-room beachfront hotel in the winter of 1965. Other hotels and apartments are in construction, as well as many homes.

Like all of the Bahamas, Freeport/Lucaya provides a benign climate and superb beaches.

A Master Plan for Freeport is in the making which will provide for a broad land utilization programme and a more detailed land utilization plan. The former will pinpoint locations for residential, industrial and commercial development while the latter will take into account streets and parking, transit and communications, schools and churches, parks and beaches and public buildings and public services.

Education

A new comprehensive Education Act known as the Education Act, 1962, and modelled in principle on the 1944 Education Act in the United Kingdom, came into effect on 1st September 1962. The new Act placed all government effort in the field of education under one authority, the Board of Education, and provided the machinery for the development of a modern system of education in the future.

The Act was amended in December 1963 in anticipation of the New Constitution which came into effect on 7th January 1964 and which gives the Bahamas internal self-government. All government effort in Education has now become the responsibility of the Minister for Education. The former Board of Education no longer exists but the Minister is advised by the Central Advisory Council for Education.

Under the Act, education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 14. Of a total of 150 Government primary schools, 130 are Out Island all-age schools.

There is one reformatory school for boys under the Industrial School Act and one for girls.

No local provision is made for Higher Education and students seeking this type of training must go abroad. Bahamians studying abroad in 1964/65 session were:

- 135 in the United Kingdom
- 100 approximately in the United States of America
- 12 in Canada (as far as can be ascertained)
- 9 in University of the West Indies

Total 256.

A special relationship has been established with the University of the West Indies and it is anticipated that many more students will attend this University in the future.

The Teachers' Training College which was temporarily closed in 1957 was re-opened in September 1961.
The Minister for Education is responsible for initiating policy on scholarships and for awarding all scholarships. He is advised on the actual number and type of scholarships to be awarded by an Advisory Council, and the proposals finalized by the Minister are approved by the Cabinet. All scholarships are advertised and all applications considered by a Selection Committee, which advises the Minister on the awards. The final selection is in the hands of the Minister.

In service training is the responsibility of each department; but their proposals must be approved by the Public Service Commission.

The following table shows the number of schools and of the children attending them in 1964/65 session:

| Primary School Roll | Secondary School Roll |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Government          | 150                   |
|                     | 20,556                |
| Others              | 60                    |
|                     | 10,609                |
|                     |                       |
|                     |                       |
|                     |                       |

The expenditure on Education in 1964 was £1,124,505. No figures are available for private and denominational schools.

Libraries

There are three Public Libraries in Nassau and 31 in the Out Islands.

Health

The Curative needs of the Colony are met by:

(a) Princess Margaret Hospital with disciplines and full-time Consultant Specialists in Medicine, Surgery, Anaesthesia, Paediatrics, Chest Diseases, Pathology, Radiology, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Ophthalmology. An O.P.D. with 24-hour Emergency Casualty Service is provided.

(b) The Mental Hospital with Consultant Psychiatrist.

(c) The Geriatric Hospital.

(d) Out Islands District Medical Officers (6).

(e) Out Islands Clinics (42).

There is also a Health Centre and a Cottage Hospital in Eleuthera and a further Cottage Hospital in Inagua. A District Nursing Service exists. Public Health is administered from Nassau and the Public Health Nursing Service and Schools Medical and Dental Service cater for all preventive services.

In Nassau there is the Private Rassin Clinic.

Medical care is free to the needy and sub-economic rates are charged others.

In 1964, there were 12,630 admissions and 461 deaths. Maternity cases were 3,950. In the Casualty O.P.D., 34,185 patients were seen. In general the pattern of diseases is subtropical and not tropical, with respiratory diseases of all ages present and Tuberculosis appearing to be capable of control, hypertensive states common and social diseases e.g., Amoebiasis, Enteritis, Venereal diseases and malnutrition all associated with poor housing and utilities common in those areas concerned.

The health of the general public remains satisfactory and the Public Health Nursing Service increased its numbers in Infant Welfare, Immunisation and Vaccination, Home visiting, Ante and post-natal, and Communicable diseases services.

Total Recurrent Expenditure was:

- Hospital and Administration: £926,630
- Public Health: £281,987
- Capital Expenditure (Public Works): £31,738

giving a grand total of £1,240,355 or 11·0% of the Colony's Revenue.

Communications

Nassau International Airport is the main airfield in the Bahamas. It provides 24 hours service for long range international and local airlines. In addition, there are 36 landing strips completed in the various Out Islands. Scheduled international air services were operated into Nassau by B.O.A.C. from London via New York and Bermuda and from Montego Bay, Jamaica; Pan American World Airways operate daily flights from Miami and New York; Trans Canada Airlines from Montreal via Tampa, Florida and from Jamaica; Mackey Airlines from Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Miami and Jacksonville; Bahamas Airways Limited operates between Nassau, Fort Lauderdale and Miami several times daily; Quantas operate once weekly in each direction between London, Nassau and Sydney, Australia.

Bahamas Airways Limited operates daily scheduled flights to many of the Out Islands. Bahamas Airways Limited and U.S.A.-Bahamas Air Services operate charter flights using landplanes between the Out Islands and between the Colony and Florida. There are 22 charter operators based in Florida licensed to provide charter services between Florida and the Bahamas.

The Freeport International Airport on Grand Bahama Island was completely modernised in 1964. It now has a new international runway of 8,300 feet capable of taking jet airliners.

During 1964, 19,500 landings were recorded at Nassau International Airport.

The following mileage is of roads in New Providence, practically all of which may be used by motor traffic:

| Waterbound macadam    | 34·63       |
| Earth surface         | 20·00       |

On Eleuthera there is an asphalt main road some 100 miles in length covering the whole of the Island and on Grand Bahama, 65 miles of motor road has been built. Asphalt roads are under construction at Andros, Exuma, Eleuthera, Cat Island, Spanish Wells, San Salvador, Long Island and Crooked Island, where previously only rough tracks existed.

There are no railways in the Colony.

There are regular freight services between the Colony and New York and Florida; Halifax and Montreal (Canadian National Steamship Line); and the United Kingdom (Royal Mail Line and Pacific Steam Navigation Company). West India Steamships Ltd. operate a service...
between Nassau and Inagua with intermediate stops.

In 1964 7,577 ships entered and 4,867 were cleared at Nassau. Their total tonnage was 11,025,877, of which 1,838,671 tons was British.

Ships also call at Inagua and Pine Ridge to take on salt and lumber exports.

**Sound and Television Broadcasting**

Government owns, and the Bahamas Broadcasting and Television Commission operates, a broadcasting station located in Nassau. The power of its transmitter is 10 kW., frequency 1,540 kc/s and call sign ZNS. Commercial operation began in 1950, though a broadcasting station has existed since 1936. The Commission took over on 1st January 1957. The broadcast receiver licence fee was abolished in 1954. At that time there were 5,990 licence holders. Government supplied and maintains 60 community receivers in school-houses in the Out Islands where there may be as many as 200 listeners in the evening.

In August 1962, a second channel opened transmission on a frequency of 1,240 kc/s with a power of 250 watts. The call sign is ZNS II. This covers the island of New Providence only. Commercial advertisements are restricted to single spots between programmes.

**Principal Occupations**

The tourist traffic continues to be the main industry of the Colony and is the chief source of revenue and of dollars.

The following table shows the number and nationality of visitors to New Providence during the years 1958–64:

| Visitors | U.S.A. | Canada | U.K. | Others |
|----------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 1958     | 177,867 | 89·4   | 5·4  | 1·9    | 3·3    |
| 1959     | 244,258 | 88·6   | 6·7  | 1·7    | 3·0    |
| 1960     | 305,553 | 88·3   | 6·6  | 2·1    | 3·0    |

Agricultural work in the United States provides employment for an average of 642 unskilled Bahamian labourers and their earnings in 1964 amounted to £633,795.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are fresh vegetables, tomatoes, okra, pineapples, peas, citrus, bananas, avocados, mangos and sisal. Some sugar cane is grown in the Colony.

The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is fully alive to the importance of expanding the livestock husbandry of the Colony and of improving the quality of the products. This is being attained by the importation of purebred animals to facilitate the up-grading of local stocks of sheep and pigs; by the provision of pastures for small groups of farmers and by encouraging the establishment of herds of beef and dairy cattle. The estimated livestock population is: sheep 22,800, goats 14,000, swine 10,700, cattle 3,500, horses 3,550, poultry 620,000.

Crawfishing and scale fishing are extensively carried out during the open season (September 1st to March 15th). The bulk of the catch is exported to the United States. The following marine products are also exported: sponge, salt, turtle shell, beach shells and marine curios.

There are four canning plants in the Colony which are engaged principally in canning tomatoes and pineapples. Straw products are manufactured as cottage industries and the raw material for this work is obtained chiefly from palm fronds and sisal fibre. Most of the canneries' output is consumed locally.

**Principal Exports by Quantity and Value**

| Item          | 1938 | 1963 | 1964 |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| Crawfish      | cwt. | 9,727| 6,426| 11,792|
| Pulpwood     | cords| —    | 114,011| 192,777|

|              |      |      |      | 57,048|

In 1938 23·8% of total imports came from the U.K.; 18·5% from other Commonwealth countries and 57·7% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1964 were 16·7%, 11·84% and 71·43%.

In 1938 22·6% of exports went to the U.K.; 22·5% to other Commonwealth countries, and 54·9% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1964 were 2·27%, 2·29% and 95·44%.

Nearly all the Colony's requirements are imported. The chief imports in 1964 were provisions, hardware, fresh beef, furniture, lumber, apparel, motor vehicles and fuel oils.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

The Bahamas Produce Exchange in Nassau handles much of the agricultural produce of the Colony. It assists the farmers in New Providence and Out Islands in disposing of their produce without glutting the market and depressing prices unnecessarily.

There are no co-operative societies in the Colony other than 17 Tomato Growers' Associations on the Islands of Eleuthera and Cat Island and 21 active Farmers' Associations situated throughout the Colony. These associations are assisted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the extent of advancing seed and fertilizer, etc., for the tomato and other crops. The Ministry markets the crops and deducts the advances from the proceeds of each consignment.
