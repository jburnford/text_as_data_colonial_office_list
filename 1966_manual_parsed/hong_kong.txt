HONG KONG

Area

The area of land is approximately 398½ square miles (Hong Kong Island 29 square miles, Kowloon 3½ square miles, Stonecutters Island ½ square mile, New Territories (leased) 365¾ square miles). It includes all islands within a rectangular area of some 738 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory. British waters are bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.

Population

The population of the Colony at the end of 1964 was 3,739,900. It is not practicable to divide these by race, but over 98% speak the Chinese language or have traditional connexions with China, though more than half are British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. At the 1961 Census, out of 3,129,648 residents including Service personnel and their families, only 49,747 gave their place of origin as outside Hong Kong and China; 33,140 of these were of Commonwealth and 16,607 of non-Commonwealth origin.

Principal Towns

The overwhelming majority of the population lives on Hong Kong Island or in Kowloon. The capital is Victoria, on Hong Kong Island.

The principal centres of population in the New Territories are Tsuen Wan, which has recently grown into an important industrial centre with large textile, enamel and rubber factories, iron works, etc.; Cheung Chau, a small but densely populated island, important as a market and fishing centre; Yuen Long, a mainland market town; Tai O, a fishing and market centre on Lantao Island; Tai Po and Shek Wu Hui, both mainland market towns; and Peng Chau, an island fishing port, with some industries.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the North, together with 235 adjacent islands ranging from Lantao with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.

The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside, in some parts covered with dense scrub, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented.
A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain—Tai Mo Shan, 3,140 feet; Lantao Peak is 3,061 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,805 feet high.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° F. in February to 82° F. in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84-76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.

History

Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters Island in the harbour, Ap Lei Chau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

Constitution

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February 1917 by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of twelve officials and thirteen unofficials, nine of whom are Chinese and one Indian. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of six officials and 20 unofficials, ten of whom are elected.

Land Policy

All land is owned by the Crown. In the early days of the Colony, Crown leases were granted for 75, 99, or 999 years. Nowadays, except in the New Territories, they are normally granted for 75 years, renewable for a further 75 years at a reassessed Crown rent. Crown leases for New Territories lands are now normally granted for a period of 99 years, less three days, from 1st July 1898.

The Government's basic policy is to sell leases to the highest bidder at public auction or by tender. Land for special housing projects, for public utilities, schools, clinics, religious and approved charitable purposes is usually granted by private treaty.

Taxation

(1) Earnings and Profits Tax.—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:

(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).

(b) Salaries Tax.

(c) Interest Tax.

(d) Property Tax.

The standard rate for 1965–66 is 12½% and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is normally only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries Tax is levied on net income from employment after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($7,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $5,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $45,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony other than in the New Territories. The rate of tax is one-half of the standard rate (i.e. 6¼%) if the rent receivable is in fact controlled by reference to 1941 rental but at the full standard rate (i.e. 12½%) on all other properties. However, property wholly occupied by the owner exclusively for residential purposes is exempt from Property Tax.

Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax, as is the case under Salaries Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.

(2) Estate Duty.—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 3% in the case of estates valued between $100,000 and $200,000, and 40% in the case of estates valued at over $15 million.

(3) Other Sources of Revenue.—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainments Tax, Betting Tax and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor and table waters.

| Public Finance | Revenue | Expenditure |

|                | HK $    | HK $        |
| 1960–61        | 859,234,131 | 845,297,629 |
| 1961–62        | 1,030,447,880 | 953,205,237 |
| 1962–63        | 1,253,064,583 | 1,113,276,099 |

| 1964–65        | 1,518,286,825 | 1,440,523,324 |

In 1964–65 $491,775,458 was raised from direct and indirect taxes, $255,225,198 from Duties and $167,590,759 from Rates. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

|                | $       |
|----------------|---------|
| Public Works   | 604,325,563 |
| Police         | 91,716,881 |
| Subventions    | 181,595,273 |
| Medical        | 94,525,377 |

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March 1965 amounted to $82,527,600 (approximately
$21·69 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:

- **3½ Dollar Loan (1940)**—$472,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- **3½ Rehabilitation Loan (1947–48)**—$46,666,000 (Sinking Fund of $23,674,738).
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes—$189,600.
- U.K. Government Loan for Kai Tak Airport Development—$35,200,000.

**Currency**

The value of the Hong Kong dollar is maintained at approximately HK $1 = 1s. 3d. sterling.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by three banks of issue: Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, The Chartered Bank and Mercantile Bank, Ltd. Subsidiary currency consists of $1, 10 cent, 5 cent and 1 cent notes and $1, 50 cent, 10 cent and 5 cent nickel alloy coins issued by the Hong Kong Government. The notes, other than the 1 cent, are gradually being withdrawn from circulation.

**Development Plans**

Over the next five years it is proposed to expend about $4,000 million on development projects, $340 million of which will be provided from the Colony's Development Loan Fund (mainly on housing), and the balance from general revenues.

The main items to be financed from revenue and the Fund are as follows:

| Item                  | $ million |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Schools               | 170       |
| New Hospitals and Clinics | 90       |
| Public Amenities      | 40        |
| Piers and Reclaimations | 130      |
| Waterworks            | 840       |
| Housing               | 1,110     |

**Other Development**

Shortage of land for housing and industry remains a problem. Since 1946 the Government has reclaimed about 1,356 acres from the sea, including about 255 acres for Kwun Tong, an industrial town on the east shore of Kowloon Bay. In 1965 the Government approved in principle proposals for establishment of two new towns at Sha Tin and Castle Peak in the New Territories and planning of a phased programme of development was in hand. Work also continued on a large reclamation project at the existing new town of Tsuen Wan/Kwai Chung.

The adequate supply of water to meet the Colony's needs has always been a problem. As a result of the completion of a storage reservoir in 1963 with a capacity of 5,400 million gallons, the signing on the 22nd April 1964 of an Agreement with the People's Council of Kwangtung to supply 15,000 million gallons annually (which came into effect on the 1st March 1965) and the above average rainfall of the summer of 1964, it has been possible, for the first time since World War II, to provide since 1st September 1964, a continuous year's supply. The sealing of the sea inlet of Plover Cove is expected in October 1966 and this will add 30,500 million gallons to the present storage capacity of 16,800 million gallons. These new capital works have necessitated, as from the 1st July 1965, an increase in the price of water which for domestic and industrial usages was increased from HK $1 to HK $2 per thousand gallons. The present consumption of the 3·75 million population is averaging 106 million gallons per day thereby giving a daily per capita consumption of 29 gallons.

Capital expenditure on public works and buildings undertaken by Government in 1964 was approximately:

| Item                                      | Millions |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                 | 208      |
| Civil Engineering                         | 94       |
| (Roads, Drainage, Reclaimations, etc.)    |          |
| Waterworks                                | 151      |

**Education**

In March 1965 education was provided in 2,258 schools for over 865,000 pupils. This figure represents approximately 23% of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:

- Kindergarten and Primary: 650,000
- Secondary: 177,000
- Adult and Further Education: 38,000

Private schools provided places for some 453,000 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 287,000; while 127 Government institutions catered for 125,000. In March 1965 there were about 2,000 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $214 million as compared with $24 million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.

The University of Hong Kong has 2,049 students in four faculties—arts, science, medicine, and engineering and architecture. The Chinese University of Hong Kong, inaugurated in October 1963, has 1,644 students in three faculties—arts, science, and commerce and social science. The annual Government grants to the two Universities totalled $30 million for 1964–65.

**Cultural facilities, Libraries and Museums**

The City Hall, a modern complex of well-equipped buildings, provides separate facilities for exhibitions, lectures, meetings and the presentation of concerts, plays and other shows both by local performers and also by artists of international repute. Since its opening in 1962 the facilities of the City Hall and in particular its two main auditoria have been in constant and heavy use.

The Museum and Art Gallery in the City Hall houses and exhibits the Hong Kong Government's Collections of historical paintings, archaeological finds and early ceramics, all relating to Hong Kong and China. In addition, there are regular and frequent temporary exhibitions of Chinese and Western art and antiquities.

The Fung Ping Shan Museum of Chinese antiquities, the teaching museum of the University of Hong Kong, is also open to the public.

There are 244 libraries including 120 school and college libraries, with a total stock of 1,100,000 volumes mostly in English and Chinese. The principal public service is provided by the two Urban Council Public Libraries in the City Hall on the Island, and on the Kowloon Peninsula.
Medical and Health

The Health division of the Medical and Health Department undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and preventive measures against disease in schools. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda and pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work. The general state of health is good.

The Government maintains and operates fifteen general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to thirteen other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony twelve private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups, including maternity beds (as on 31st March 1965) are 5,150, 5,221 and 2,128 respectively.

In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1964 totalled over 175,000 and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were over 840,000. There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.

Government expenditure on these services during the year 1964-65 amounted to approximately $126.7 million, compared with $104.7 million in the previous year.

Capital expenditure on medical projects under the Public Works Non-Recurrent head accounted for another $7.12 million.

Thirty-four cases of cholera with four deaths occurred during 1964. The first case was a completely sporadic one, notified on 19th February. A further case was notified on 30th April and subsequently 32 more cases were reported; the last one on 30th June. The Colony was declared free from infection on 11th July.

The most serious health problem is tuberculosis; 12,557 cases were notified in 1964 with 11.5% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned over 1,590 deaths; infant mortality was 26.4 per 1,000 live births.

Communications

Hong Kong Airport, Kai Tak situated on the north shore of Kowloon Bay, is some four miles from the centre of Kowloon, and is regularly used by twenty airlines and ten charter airlines which provide frequent services to Europe, America and neighbouring territories. The Colony, with its modern runway of 8,350 feet is an important link in the main air routes of the Far East. B.O.A.C. operates ten services per week to London, seven via Europe and three via U.S.A. Full night flying facilities, precision approach radar, and an instrument landing system are available.

In 1964-65, 19,217 aircraft arrived and departed on international flights, carrying 809,638 passengers, 2,036 metric tons of mail and 10,819 metric tons of freight.

Rail.—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1964 amounted to 670,441 metric tons and 8,686,487 passengers were carried.

Roads.—There are 556 miles of roadway, 97% of which is of metalled construction.

Shipping.—55,888 vessels entered and cleared during 1964-65, their net registered tonnage being 54,632,252; 1,860,390 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. Frequent ferry services cross the harbour and link the principal islands to the westward.

Sound and Television Broadcasting

Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW) and VHF/FM (5 kW) from two separate stations, in English and four Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 2½ kW. There were 142,181 licence holders at the end of 1964. Rediffusion (Hong Kong), Limited, operate a wired broadcasting service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1964 there were some 29,033 subscribers to the service. Rediffusion Limited also operate a wired television service which had 35,573 subscribers at the end of 1964. A commercial broadcasting organization, the Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Co., Ltd., transmits programmes on medium wave (1 kW) in English and two Chinese dialects.

Principal Occupations

Before the war most of the urban population was engaged in commerce but, since 1948, there has been a significant growth of local industries. In June 1965, there were 359,945 employees in 8,374 registered and recorded factories and industrial undertakings; 153,118 of them were women. More than 150,000 were estimated as being employed in smaller cottage-type industries and as out-workers. About 110,000 were engaged in agriculture and fishing and 120,000 in building and construction.

The report of the 1961 census recorded an economically active population of 1,211,999. Only 15,802, mostly men, claimed that they were unemployed and 5,098 stated that they were seeking their first jobs. The main groups of occupations were as follows:

| Occupation                  | Number |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Manufacture                 | 476,000|
| Services                    | 265,000|

| Farming and fishing         | 88,000 |
| Communications              | 87,000 |
| Miscellaneous and unclassified | 44,000 |

On 31st March 1965 there were 239 registered workers' unions with a declared membership of 149,675; 56 employers' associations with a declared membership of 6,645 and 16 mixed unions with a declared membership of 9,371.

Main Crops and Products

Since the end of the last war, the pattern of agricultural production has largely changed from a subsistence economy based on rice to the intensive production of vegetables, poultry or pigs. The estimated production of crops in 1964 was 142,000 long tons of vegetables, 12,000 long tons of paddy, 18,000 long tons of sweet potatoes and 1,700 long tons of fruit. The total value of crop production was $75,848,000.

The estimated number of cattle is 15,750 head and of pigs 256,800 head; there are some 2,121,600 head of poultry, including breeding stock and birds for egg production. There are more than 646,000 head of other types of bird, including ducks, pigeons, geese and quail.
In 1964, 51,143 tons of fresh and salt/dried marine fish were marketed at the five wholesale fish markets operated by the Fish Marketing Organization against 57,457 tons in the previous year.

During 1964 the following were mined:
- Kaolin clay: 5,043 tons
- Iron ore: 114,374 tons
- Graphite (80% fixed carbon): 617 tons
- Graphite (50% fixed carbon): 93 tons
- Wolfram ore: 1 ton
- Quartz: 1,649 tons
- Feldspar: 1,556 tons

Cement produced for export and local use amounted to 211,636 tons in 1964.

Trade

Local industries are responsible for approximately 77% of Hong Kong's total export.

The following figures show the main items of exports of Hong Kong during 1963 and 1964.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are twenty-seven Vegetable Marketing Cooperative Societies with a membership of more than 9,000. These Societies have formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies. In addition, two Irrigation Societies, five Salaried Workers' Thrift and Loan Societies, nine Consumers' Credit Societies, one Fish Pond Society, 207 Housing Societies, ten Agricultural Credit Societies, twelve Better Living Societies, one Apartment Owners' Society and 46 Pig Raising Societies have been formed. Many of the last named have also federated and formed a Federation of Pig Raising Societies. Fishermen are becoming more aware of the benefits of co-operation and there are 54 Fishermen's Thrift and Loan Societies, three Fishermen's Thrift Societies, three Fishermen's Credit and Marketing Societies and two Fishermen's Credit and Housing Societies. Fifty Fishermen's Co-operative Societies have formed themselves into four Federations. The total number of members of Co-operative Societies is more than 22,000.
The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market in Kowloon from co-operative societies and collecting depots in the new Territories.

Five wholesale fish markets are operated by the Fish Marketing Organization. A revolving loan fund with a present temporary ceiling of $3,000,000 has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; over $17,920,000 has been loaned from it. The Organization also operates schools for fishermen's children and provides education for some 2,500 students at its 11 primary schools. 900 fishermen's children are, in addition, attending other primary and secondary schools with financial assistance provided by the Organization.
