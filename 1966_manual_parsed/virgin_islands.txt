**VIRGIN ISLANDS**

**Area**

The total area of the Colony is about 59 square miles. Excluding numerous small rocks, the islands number 36, of which 11 are inhabited. The largest are Tortola (21 square miles), Virgin Gorda (8¼ square miles), Anegada (15 square miles) and Jost Van Dyke (3½ square miles).

**Population**

The estimated population in 1964 was 8,619.
Principal Town
Road Town, Tortola, is the seat of the Administration.

Geographical Features
The Islands, except for Anegada, represent a projection of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands archipelago. Anegada, a flat coral feature of more recent geological formation, is the northern outpost of the group in the Atlantic, and is surrounded by dangerous reefs. Virgin Gorda and Tortola rise abruptly like the tops of submerged mountains from a submarine plateau of 20–30 fathoms of water. The highest elevation is 1,780 feet on Sage Mountain, Tortola, where the remnants of an interesting xerophytic rain forest still exist; Virgin Peak on Virgin Gorda is 1,370 feet high.

Climate
The climate of the group is particularly healthy. The average annual rainfall at Road Town, the capital, on the south-east of Tortola, is 53 inches. The average temperature in winter is 71°–82°F. and in summer 78°–88°F.

History
In 1648 a party of Dutch buccaneers are said to have set up their abode at Soper's Hole, Tortola, but were driven out by a party of English adventurers in 1666. In 1672 Colonel Stapleton, Governor of the Leeward Islands, took Tortola from the Dutch, who were then in possession. It was not, however, until 1680, according to Suckling's historical account of the Virgin Islands, that the islands were permanently settled by English planters from Anguilla; they have been uninterruptedly British since then. In 1773 the Settlers were granted a charter and the first House of Assembly was convened the following year.

Constitution
The Administrator is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of two official and three unofficial Members. The Virgin Islands Constitution Act, 1950, under which the legislature was constituted, was replaced by the Virgin Islands Constitution and Elections Ordinance, 1954, which provides for a Legislative Council with an elected majority elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The Legislative Council consists of the Administrator as President, two nominated official members, two nominated non-official members and six elected members. The Council elects at its first meeting a Deputy President who presides in the absence of the Administrator (see also Antigua (page 55) and "Common Institutions and Services" (page 176) with reference to Joint Police Force, the Judiciary, etc.).

Land Policy
Aliens cannot hold land except under licence from the Administrator.

The total area of Crown lands is estimated at 15,121 acres. Most of it is situated in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. In Anegada, where the soil is poor, the occupants of Crown lands are allowed the use of those lands free of charge but rentals are collected from occupants of Crown lands elsewhere, where there is good soil fertility. Arrangements exist for the sale of Crown lands to occupants in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. Non-natives own approximately 4,562 acres of the total land area of the Colony. The prevailing type of tenure for all holdings is fee simple.

Taxation
Taxes consist mainly of Customs duties and land, house, road, animal, boat and income taxes. Import duties average 12% ad valorem at general rates and 8% ad valorem at preferential rates. Export duties are fixed at specific rates which average less than 5% at current market values.

The income tax rate upon the chargeable income of every person other than a company, ranges from 6d. to 13s. 6d. in the £. Companies pay a flat rate of 5s. 6d. in every £.

Provision is made for a grant by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the Colony.

Currency
In 1958 legislation was passed making United States currency legal tender in the Colony, in addition to British and West Indian currencies which, although legal tender, are not in fact used at all.

Development Plans
The following amounts have been allocated to the Colony under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts: £106,600 (1945); £202,877 (1955–60); £170,000 (1960–64); and £150,000 (1964–66). Expenditure on schemes up to 1952 was undertaken mainly on school buildings, agricultural and livestock development, water supplies and health projects. Since 1953 a road construction programme has been in progress; additional staff has been recruited for the Public Works Department to carry out the programme, and road-making machinery and plant have been purchased. A radio-telephone system has been established between Road Town and West End, Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke and also between Road Town and St. Thomas; and a piped water supply installed in Road Town. In 1962 Dr. Carleen O'Loughlin of the University of the West Indies published a comprehensive report on development in the Colony, recommending priorities of road construction and airfield extension. A local Development Advisory Committee submitted a report in January 1963 covering a three-year development plan for the Colony taking these priorities into account. A comprehensive road construction programme has now been embarked upon.

Education
There is one secondary school and two primary schools maintained by Government, 12 denominational schools, which receive grants from Government funds, one private school and two community schools. In 1964 there were 1,239 male and 1,271 female pupils enrolled in all schools. Attendance was approximately 87.7% of enrolment.
The cost of primary education, except the provision and maintenance of denominational school buildings, is met from Government funds and in 1964 the sum of U.S. $152,373 was so expended, compared with U.S. $2,010 in 1938.

Libraries

There is a Library in Road Town, said to be the best of the small libraries in the British Caribbean. There are library deposit stations in the out-islands. In 1964 the Library had a total of 12,680 books and 1,763 registered borrowers.

Health

The Tortola Cottage Hospital has 35 beds, and a total of 648 in-patients received treatment during 1964. There were 2,121 out-patients at the hospital. The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1964 was U.S. $96,358 compared with U.S. $2,512 in 1938.

Communications

There are airfields suitable for small aircraft on Beef Island and Virgin Gorda.

Launches maintain a daily mail and passenger service with St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, whence air, sea and cable communications exist to all parts of the world. Through-bookings can be obtained at St. Thomas to almost any destination in Europe or the western hemisphere.

By an external telephone system which links Tortola with St. Thomas and Puerto Rico, messages can be sent to all parts of the world.

A commercial radio station was opened in July 1965.

Principal Occupations

The principal occupations in order of importance are:

(a) The public service—the civil service, education service and non-established workers.

(b) Industry—largely hotels.

(c) Building trades—construction, repairs, maintenance.

(d) Agriculture (whole- and part-time).

(e) Transport services—land and sea passenger and freight.

(f) Commercial undertakings—stores, shops, banks, etc.

(g) Fishing.

(h) Cottage industries.

(i) Personal services.

There is a considerable demand for labour in St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, by the tourist industry and this provides the principal wage-earning employment.

Main Crops and Products

The main food crops are vegetables and fruit. The estimated livestock population in 1964 was: cattle 6,612, sheep 3,041, goats 11,800, swine 7,136. The fishing industry is unorganized.
