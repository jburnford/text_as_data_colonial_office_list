ANTIGUA
Area
The area of Antigua is 108 square miles, the Dependency of Barbuda 62 square miles, the Dependency of Redonda (uninhabited) half a square mile. Barbuda lies 25 miles to the north, Redonda 25 miles to the south-west of the main island.

Population
The de facto population at the 1960 census numbered 54,304.

Principal Town
St. John's, the capital, had a population of about 21,600 at the census.

Geographical Features
The western part of the island of Antigua is composed entirely of volcanic rocks (highest point Boggy Peak, 1,330 feet). The eastern and northern parts are of limestone, below 500 feet above sea level, and a central plain stretches diagonally across the island. Barbuda is very flat with a large lagoon on the west side. There are no rivers.

History
The first settlers were a few English who arrived in 1632. In 1663 Charles II made a formal grant to Lord Willoughby, who at once proceeded to send out large numbers of colonists. For a short time the island was in French occupation, but in 1667 it was declared an English possession in terms of the Treaty of Breda and has remained British from that date.

Constitution
Following decisions taken at a Constitutional Conference in London in June 1959, a new constitution came into force on 1st January 1960. The main features are:

(a) The post of Governor is abolished and the Administrator has become Her Majesty's Representative in the Territory. The Administrator is now appointed by Her Majesty and exercises such of the former powers of the Governor as have been retained under the new constitution (these powers are considerably reduced under the new constitution);

(b) The Executive Council has the general control and direction of the government of the Territory. It is presided over by the Administrator and there are one ex officio member (the principal law officer) and five unofficial members (including the Chief Minister and three other Ministers). Of these the four Ministers are appointed from the elected members of the Legislative Council and the other unofficial member is appointed from either the elected or the Nominated members of the Legislative Council. The Administrator appoints as Chief Minister the member of the Legislative Council who, in his judgment, is most likely to command a majority in the Legislative Council. The other unofficial members are appointed by the Administrator on the advice of the Chief Minister. Ministers are assigned responsibility for any Government business (including financial matters) except criminal proceedings, internal security, the audit of public accounts and the public service;

(c) The Legislative Council is composed of one ex officio member (the principal law officer), two Nominated members appointed by the Administrator in his discretion and ten members elected by universal adult suffrage. It is presided over by a Speaker elected by the Council either from within or without the Council; and having only a casting vote. There is a Deputy Speaker elected from within the Council;
(d) The appointment, dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers is vested in the Administrator in his discretion acting after consultation with an advisory Public Service Commission. The Administrator is also responsible in his discretion for appointing the Head of the joint Police Force of Antigua, Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and for appointing gazetted ranks of the joint Police Force after consulting the single advisory Police Service Commission which has been established to serve the territories of Antigua, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Virgin Islands. Further details about the Police Service Commission and about the Judiciary are given on page 176.

Land Policy

Land may not be alienated or leased to aliens without the consent of the Administrator in Council. Except in a few cases, alien occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. There is a small amount of Crown land which, when not used for public purposes, may be leased or sold.

Taxation

The main forms of taxation are income tax, trade tariffs and excise duties. The rates of individual income tax range from 2½ cents to 65 cents per $ of chargeable income. Company tax is 40% of chargeable income.

Provision has been made for double taxation relief with the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and the U.S.A., and consideration is being given to extending the arrangements to other countries.

Currency

A new Currency Board, the East Caribbean Currency Authority, was established in 1965 under the provisions of the East Caribbean Currency Agreement made on 18th January 1965 between the Governments of Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Montserrat, St. Kitts–Nevis–Anguilla, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. The new Authority has issued its own currency notes of $1, $5, $20 and $100 denominations. The coins issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) will continue to be used for the time being. These are of 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent denominations. The unit of currency is the East Caribbean Dollar which has a parity of 4s. 2d., that is $4·80 to the £1 sterling.

Coolidge Airfield, which was constructed by the American Army Air Force as a military airfield in 1942, is now used by the local Government as a civil airfield. It is used mainly by Pan American Airways, British West Indian Airways, Leeward Islands Air Transport, Trans-Canada Airlines, Air France and B.O.A.C. with direct services to other West Indian Islands and to the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States of America. Travel to other parts of the world is made by connexions from Trinidad, Jamaica and America. One runway was extended in December 1961 to accommodate a jet service.
