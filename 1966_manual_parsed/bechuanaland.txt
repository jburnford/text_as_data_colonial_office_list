BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE

Area

Bechuanaland has not been surveyed as a whole, but its area is estimated at 222,000 square miles. The headquarters is at Gaberones, the new capital, to which the administration moved from Mafeking during 1965.

Population

The census taken in 1964 showed a population of 535,275 Africans, 3,921 Europeans, 3,489 Euraficans and 382 Asians. The 1964 Census of total population was 543,105.

The population is not evenly distributed, the bulk of the people living in the eastern part of the country with one fairly large tribe occupying the north-western corner. The central, western and southern areas of the territory, consisting for the most part of the Kalahari Desert, are extremely sparsely inhabited.

The Batswana tribes tend to live in large villages or towns; they are Bakgatla (32,118), Bakwena (73,088), Bangwaketse (71,289), Bamalete (13,848), Bamangwato (201,007), Barolong (10,688), Batswana (42,399), Batlokwa (3,735). About one-half of the population lives in towns of more than 1,000 inhabitants.

Principal Towns

The main business centres are Lobatsi (population 7,639), Gaberones (about 5,000) and Francistown (9,479).

Other large towns are:—Serowe (34,182), Kanye (34,045), Molepolole (29,625); Mochudi (17,712); Mahalapye (13,199); Moshupa (12,892); Thamaga (10,777); and Ramoutsu (10,549).

Geographical Features

Bechuanaland is bounded on the south by Cape Province, on the south-east by the Transvaal, on the north-east by Rhodesia, on the north by the Caprivi Zipfel and on the west by South West Africa. It lies between latitudes 18° and 37° south and longitudes 20° and 29° 50' east. The Kalahari Desert extends over much of the territory west and south of Ngamiland as far as latitude 27°S. This is not a desert in the commonly accepted sense of the word, but consists of a vast expanse of undulating sand-belts with outcrops of limestone. In these limestone belts water is sometimes found at depths from 30 to 100 feet and it is possible that under the deep overburden of sand there may exist untapped reservoirs. The northern
and south-western corners of the Kalahari have the least vegetation and most sand dunes, but elsewhere the grasses are excellent, and this is the natural habitat of the aboriginal Bushmen. Large areas are wooded like parklands with camel-thorn and other indigenous trees.

In the north-western part of Bechuanaland the Okovango River, flowing inland from Angola, widens into a delta from which flood-waters, in seasons of heavy rainfall, flow as far south-east as the Makarikari salt-lake and south and southwest into Lake Ngami. The Chobe River, also flowing from Angola, inundates a large area in the north before flowing into the Zambesi 60 miles west of the Victoria Falls.

The mean altitude is 3,300 feet and in the eastern portion occasional elevations, e.g. at Kanye, Serowe and Ghanzi, reach 4,000 to 5,000 feet.

Bechuanaland as a whole is a natural game-reserve for most species of the fauna of Africa and Government policy aims at their preservation.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical (latitude 22°S. passes through the centre of the country) but varies with latitude and altitude.

The average annual rainfall is 18 inches, varying from 27 inches in the north to 9 inches or less in the western Kalahari.

In the higher parts, days are pleasantly warm and the nights cold during the winter, but the summer is hot. In August seasonal winds blow from the west coast and, dessicated by the Kalahari, carry sand and dust across the whole country.

The atmosphere throughout the year is very dry and this helps somewhat to mitigate the high temperature.

History

In 1884 the British Government appointed a Deputy Commissioner to the Bechuana tribes and in 1885 the whole of the Bechuanaland was, with the concurrence of Khama and other principal chiefs, proclaimed to be under the protection of Her Majesty The Queen. The southern part of the territory, which included Mafeking, Vryburg and Kuruman, was at the same time constituted a Crown Colony with the title British Bechuanaland.

In 1885 British Bechuanaland was annexed to Cape Colony, subsequently the Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa. The northern part, known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate, continued to be administered by the Government of the United Kingdom.

The South Africa Act of Union of 1909, which established the Union of South Africa, included provisions for the possible inclusion in South Africa of the three territories of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland, which were administered by the High Commissioner for South Africa.

When the South African Constitution was being drawn up the Chiefs in Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland objected to any scheme which would bring their territories under the rule of South Africa. Assurances were given that no immediate change would be made in the administration of these territories, but provision was made for the possible eventual transfer subject to certain conditions for the protection of African rights embodied in the Act.

After 1909, successive South African Governments asked for the three territories to be transferred to South Africa and successive British Governments reiterated the pledge made during the passage of the 1909 South Africa Bill through Parliament, that the ultimate responsibility in the question of a decision about transfer rested with the British Government and that no such transfer could take place until the wishes of the inhabitants of the territories had been considered. No requests for transfer have been received recently.

The administration of the territory is governed by various Orders in Council and Proclamations, of which the most important was the Order in Council of Her Majesty Queen Victoria dated 9th May 1891. That Order empowered the then High Commissioner for South Africa to exercise on Her Majesty's behalf all the powers and jurisdiction which Her Majesty had or might have within the Protectorate and to that end authorized him to take or cause to be taken all such measures as he might think expedient, subject to such instructions as he might from time to time receive from Her Majesty or through a Secretary of State. Other provisions of the Order empowered the High Commissioner to appoint administrative and judicial officers and to assign their functions to them subject to the preservation of his own powers in their entirety and to provide, by proclamation from time to time, for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue and the peace, order and good government of all persons within the Protectorate, including the prohibition and punishment of acts tending to disturb the public peace.

In issuing these proclamations the High Commissioner was instructed by the Order in Council to respect any Native laws and customs by which the civil relations of any Native chiefs, tribes or population under Her Majesty's protection were at that time (viz., in May 1891) regulated, except in so far as the same might be incompatible with the due exercise of Her Majesty's power and jurisdiction or which were repugnant to humanity.

The Order required the High Commissioner to publish his proclamations in the Gazette and reserved to Her Majesty the right to disallow any such proclamation. The Order also provided that, subject to any proclamation lawfully issued by the High Commissioner, any jurisdiction exercisable otherwise than under this Order in Council of 1891, whether by virtue of any Statute or Order in Council, or of any treaty, or otherwise, should remain in full force. Her Majesty reserved the power to revoke, alter, add to or amend this Order at any time.

On 28th July 1960 the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations announced his approval of proposals for a new Constitution. This was promulgated in the Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution) Order in Council, 1960, which provided for a Legislative Council with power to legislate for the territory, subject to certain reserve powers remaining with the High Commissioner.

The Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution) (Amendment) Order 1963 created, in place of the former post of Resident Commissioner, the post of Her Majesty's Commissioner equivalent in status to that of a Governor. It also empowered the Commissioner to assent to legislation and made him directly responsible to the Secretary of State. The post of High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, was abolished on 1st August 1964.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and for the Colonies announced on
2nd June 1964 the British Government's general agreement with the unanimous proposals for the revision of the constitution formulated during the second half of 1963 at discussions initiated by the then Resident Commissioner in which representatives of all political parties and other important groups in Bechuanaland participated.

**Constitution**

The Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution) Order 1965, which became effective in March 1965, provides for a Cabinet consisting of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and up to five other Ministers drawn from the Legislative Assembly. The latter consists of a Speaker, 31 elected members, four special members elected by the elected members and the Attorney-General (who may speak but not vote). A single voters' roll based on universal adult suffrage provides for the election of the 31 members from one-member constituencies. There is a House of Chiefs consisting of the Chiefs of the eight principal tribes and four other members elected by and from the sub-Chiefs of the Chobe, Francistown, Ghanzi and Kgalagadi districts with the special functions of considering draft Bills affecting tribal matters as well as having the right to make representations to Government on any issue affecting the interest of the Tribes. Her Majesty's Commissioner acts in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, subject to his special responsibility for external affairs, defence and security and the public service, and the retention of general reserve executive and legislative powers. A code of fundamental human rights, enforceable by the High Court, is also contained in the Constitution. The Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution) (Amendment) Order 1965 varied certain provisions governing Cabinet proceedings.

The first general election was held on 1st March 1965. A total of 140,789 people voted; 28 seats went to the Bechuanaland Democratic Party, (leader Mr. Seretse Khama) and 3 to Bechuanaland Peoples Party (leader Mr. P. Matane). The Botswana Independence Party (leader Mr. M. Mpho) gained no seats.

It was announced in October 1965 that the British Government had agreed that a date in the latter part of 1966 would be appropriate for the territory to become independent and that it was expected that the necessary steps could be taken to enable this to be achieved by 30th September 1966.

A conference was held in London in February 1966 to settle the terms of the independence constitution. Its main task was to consider proposals formulated by the Bechuanaland Government which envisaged the establishment of Bechuanaland as an independent Sovereign Republic, to be known as Botswana. The proposals were agreed, subject to certain modifications, and it was announced that Bechuanaland would become independent under the name of Botswana on 30th September 1966.

**Land Tenure**

The territory is divided into Crown lands (104,069 square miles); four European blocks of farms, mainly on land near the eastern border granted in perpetuity to the British South African Company in 1895, and eight Tribal Territories: Batswana (35,082 square miles); Bamangwato (44,310 square miles); Batlokwa (67 square miles); Bamalete (167 square miles); Bakgatla (2,798 square miles); Bakwena (14,719 square miles); Bangwaketse (9,921 square miles); and Barolong Farms (433 square miles), where ownership of land is vested in the tribes for allocation by the Chiefs.

**Taxation**

The main forms of direct taxation are income tax, cattle export tax and local government tax. The principal sources of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Bechuanaland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on all imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades, businesses and professions. There are also death duties.

| Public Finance | Revenue | Expenditure |

(a) Revised Estimate (b) Estimate

(Excluding Colonial Development and Welfare funds.)

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1965–66:

- Customs and Excise .. 580,450
- Taxes and duties .. 796,250
- Posts and telegraphs .. 261,210
- Revenue from Government property .. 275,100

United Kingdom grant-in-aid was £1,155,000 (1961–62); £1,362,914 (1962–63); £1,592,131 (1963–64); and £1,820,849 (1964–65).

As revenue was expected to be substantially below expenditure and the territory had no central balance the United Kingdom Government approved a grant-in-aid of £1,750,000 for 1965–66.

**Currency**

During February 1961 the territory followed the South African change from sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R. 2; 1 shilling = 10 cents). The Standard Bank of South Africa and Barclays Bank (D.C.O.) each have branches at Francistown, Lobatsi, Mahalapye and Gaberones and operate approximately 30 agencies from them. A Government-financed National Development Bank was founded in 1964.

**Development Plans**

Under the Commonwealth Development Act 1963, Bechuanaland received an allocation of £2,100,000. This, together with a supplementary allocation of £560,000 made earlier in 1963 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, and the unspent balance of previous allocations, gave the Protectorate approximately £2,716,000 towards development over the period 1963–66. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:
Agriculture and veterinary £697,000
Water supplies £547,000
Education £825,000
Roads £988,000
Headquarters £2,190,000

Education

Communications are difficult, distances great and financial resources far from commensurate with urgent needs. Consequently the administration and promotion of African education are unusually difficult.

Most of the administrative work has devolved upon tribal school committees and in three remote areas education is administered directly by the District Commissioners concerned and the Department of Education.

Primary Education. Enrolled in the 241 African primary schools in Bechuanaland during 1964 were 62,839 pupils of whom approximately 56% were girls. The disparity between the sexes, caused by the absence of boys at cattle-posts and on the land, has had a retarding influence ever since schools were first established.

Secondary Education. Three of the eight secondary schools in the territory are co-educational secondary boarding institutions offering the Cambridge School Certificate course.

These are Moeng College, founded by the late Mr. Tshekedi Khama, a Catholic Mission school, St. Joseph's College, near Gaberones and the London Missionary School, Moedig College, which was opened in 1962. All are grant-aided by Government.

The remaining five are day secondary schools which offer three-year courses leading to the Junior Certificate. Three are administered by Tribal School Committees, one is a grant-aided Catholic Mission school in Francistown and one is an independent unaided school in Serowe.

Total enrolment in 1964 was 1,036.

Trades Training. A Trades School, known now as Bechuanaland Training Centre, built at a cost of £65,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds was opened in 1962. It offers courses in building, carpentry and motor mechanics.

Teacher Training. One Teacher Training College is situated in Lobatsi and another in Serowe. Capital cost of the latter, paid for from Colonial Development and Welfare funds amounted to approximately £100,000.

Total output from both Colleges will rise by about 100 per annum in 1966.

Youth Movements. There are about 6,000 Boy Scouts divided into 123 groups and 6,166 Girl Guides, in 103 groups. Monthly bulletins are issued to all Scout and Guide officers. A government grant of £150 per year to the Girl Guides and £200 per year to the Boy Scouts is applied chiefly to training and travelling expenses.

The total estimated expenditure on educational service from funds controlled by Government, by Tribal Administrations and by missions in the financial year ended 31st March 1964, was £629,881 of which £100,478 was contributed by Colonial Development and Welfare schemes.

Health

There are seven hospitals in Bechuanaland, four of which are Government Hospitals. There are eight Government Health Centres and five Mission Health Centres. Forty-three Dispensaries are administered by Government, and 40 by Missions. Altogether there are 1,529 beds and cots.

During 1964 there were 491,084 Out-patient attendances. The main diseases were tuberculosis, gastro-enteritis, pneumonia and malaria.

Maternity work, including ante-natal and post-natal care is mainly carried out in the hospitals but there is a special maternity centre administered by the London Missionary Society and supervised by the Government Medical Officer of the district.

The technical staff consists of the Director of Medical Services, the Deputy Director of Medical Services, the Medical Officer of Health, 13 Medical Officers, nine Sanitary Inspectors, the Senior Matron, three Matrons, one Sister-in-Charge, one Sister Tutor and 20 Nursing Sisters. There is a subsidiary nursing staff, trained and semi-trained.

African nurses are trained at both Government and Mission Hospitals. Midwives are trained at the Government Hospital, Francistown, at the Maun Maternity Centre and at the Molepolole Mission Hospital. Nurses undergo a four-year course in general nursing and then receive a year's course in Midwifery.

Communications

The main railway line from Cape Town to the north runs through Bechuanaland, entering it at Ramathlabama, 886 miles from Cape Town, and leaving it at Ramaquabane, 394 miles farther north. The line runs roughly parallel to the eastern boundary of the territory at an average distance from it of about 50 miles. The railway within the territory is owned and operated by Rhodesia Railways. The gauge is 3 feet 6 inches.

There are five miles of tarred roads, and 4,930 miles of gravelled or earth roads, 2,567 of which are maintained by the Public Works Department. A £3·6 million loan made by the International Development Association in 1964 is being used for construction of a new road from Francistown to Maun and for improvement to gravel standard of the main road from the Rhodesian border in the north to the South African border in the south.

There are aerodromes at Francistown and Shakawe and airfields at Gaberones, Ghanzi, Gomare, Kanye, Kasane, Lobatsi, Moshaneng, Mahalapye, Makalamabedi, Maun, Molepolole, Nokaneng, Palapye, Panda-ma-Tenga, Rakops and Serowe, with emergency landing grounds at a number of other points.

Principal Occupations

The number of persons in regular employment, apart from those employed or self-employed in cattle raising, agriculture and domestic services, at the 1964 Census was:

Mining and Quarrying 1,940
Manufacturing 2,420
Construction 2,704
Electricity, Water and Sanitary services 120
Commerce 2,468
Transport, Storage and Communications 2,315
Services (Central and Local Government) 9,798

21,765
It is estimated that a further 30,000 Batswana work in the Republic of South Africa, mostly on a migratory basis. About 227,000 persons are employed in agriculture, the majority being self-employed cattle and grain farmers, generally at subsistence level.

Main Crops and Products

The main occupation of the Batswana is cattle raising. The number of cattle in 1964 was 1,346,533, of which 15,050 animals and 108,000 carcasses were exported. There were also 136,847 sheep, 378,489 goats and 2,110 pigs. Seasonal lack of water and grazing and indifferent animal husbandry are the chief handicaps to the expansion of the industry.

Irregular rainfall causes occasional crop failures. The principal crops are sorghum and beans.

Active prospecting work is being carried out by several mining companies in different areas, and there are prospects of development of copper and soda ash deposits in the north. The asbestos mine at Moshaneng in the Banwaketse Tribal Territory closed down in May 1965. Manganese is mined in the Balamete Tribal Territory.
