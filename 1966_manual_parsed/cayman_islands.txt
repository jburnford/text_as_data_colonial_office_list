CAYMAN ISLANDS

Area

The Islands consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

Population

The corrected 1960 census gives a total de facto population of 7,622: Grand Cayman 6,359, Cayman Brac 1,240, Little Cayman 23. The de jure population was 8,511, of which the main groups were African 1,460, European 1,564, Asiatic 3, mixed 5,384.

Principal Towns

At the 1960 census the de facto populations of Georgetown and West Bay on Grand Cayman were 2,573 and 2,086 respectively.

Geographical Features

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is about 178 miles to the west of Jamaica. It is about 22 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to eight miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

Climate

From November to March it is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north and temperatures range from 65° to 75°. In the summer the range of temperature is somewhat higher and during certain periods mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown averages 50 inches per annum. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system. During 1956 a combined British and American weather station specifically for hurricane research was established on Grand Cayman.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670 when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown, the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1733. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for a long time a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1776 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 933, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

Constitution

When Jamaica achieved independence on the 6th of August 1962, the office of Governor of Jamaica, and consequently also of Governor of the Cayman Islands, disappeared. The 1959 Constitution was accordingly amended by Order in Council to provide for the assumption by the Administrator of most of the powers and responsibilities formerly exercised by the Governor. The Executive Council consists of two official and three unofficial members, with the Administrator presiding. The Legislative Assembly consists of the Administrator as President, two or three official members appointed by the Administrator, two or three nominated non-official members appointed by the Administrator and twelve members elected by
a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The appointments of the official and nominated members to the Legislative Assembly are made in pursuance of instructions given to the Administrator by Her Majesty through a Secretary of State. The Assembly elects a Deputy President who presides in the absence of the Administrator. It also elects two of the three unofficial members of Executive Council. During 1962, the "Membership" system of Government was introduced, under which the three unofficial members of the Executive Council assume a special interest in a range of subjects and advise the Government in the subjects with which they are associated.

On the 6th of August 1962, all Acts, Ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, and other instruments made under or having effect by virtue of the 1959 Order in Council had effect as if they had been made under or by virtue of the 1962 Order. So that, for example, the Jamaica Laws which had been applied to the Cayman Islands became in effect, on the 6th of August, Laws of the Cayman Islands.

Land Policy

All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation

A poll tax of £1 per adult male between the ages of 18 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 20% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1960 (Apr.–Dec.) | 151,517 | 144,664 |

| 1963 | 258,735 | 242,503 |

It is estimated that in 1964 £197,373 was derived from Customs receipts and £31,007 from the sale of postage stamps. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Education £42,354, Medical £38,637, Public Works £19,944, Posts and Telegraphs £16,637.

The Public Debt as at 1st January 1964 was as follows:

Road and Airport Resurfacing loans, 1958: outstanding £66,743.

Intercolonial Loan, 1981: £22,843.

" " 1983: £23,919.

Currency

The currency in circulation is Jamaica notes and British silver of all denominations.

Development

The Islands have, under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, an allocation of £65,000. A road improvement programme was recently completed, linking the three main centres of population in Grand Cayman. Other more recently completed works include a new Government House and housing for Government officers. Projects planned include public buildings, road and harbour improvements and improvements of social services.

In the last few years a number of hotels catering for tourists have been opened on Grand Cayman and one on Cayman Brac.

Education

There is free and compulsory education for children between the ages of 7 and 14 in 11 Government primary schools and a number of church sponsored schools. Enrolment in all schools in 1964 was 2,011, of which 174 were receiving post-primary education. Expenditure in 1964 amounted to £42,354.

Libraries

There is a well-equipped public library in Georgetown, Grand Cayman.

Health

Expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1964 was £38,637. The hospital has accommodation for 33 patients. Medical Officers are seconded from Jamaica. A District Surgeon, to whom a retainer from public funds is paid, has been in practice in Grand Cayman since December 1957. A District Surgeon was appointed to Cayman Brac in 1963.

Communications

Owen Roberts airfield in Grand Cayman is used by B.W.I.A. and Lineas Aereas Costaricenses, S.A. There are regular air services between Grand Cayman and Kingston, Miami, San José (Costa Rica) and Panama City. A 3,250 ft. airstrip has been constructed in Cayman Brac and a regular service by light aircraft is in operation. A private airstrip has also been constructed on Little Cayman capable of taking light aircraft.

A motor vessel service is maintained between Kingston, Tampa (Florida) and all three islands. There is also more or less regular communication with Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels.

Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac; there is a motorable track in Little Cayman.

Wireless stations are maintained by the Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. Wireless communication exists between Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, and a telephone system is now being installed.

Principal Occupations

The chief industry next to the tourist industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment with overseas shipping companies. Remittances to their families enable a standard of living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, and one union, the Global Seaman's Union, has been registered. There is little unemployment.

Crops and Products

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone
soil. The main export products of importance are turtle and thatch rope. The manufacture of thatch rope was at one time the mainstay of the poorer people, but the industry is now in decline.

The trade of the Cayman Islands is mainly with the United States and with Jamaica.
