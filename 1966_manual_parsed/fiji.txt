FIJI

Area

The aggregate land area is 7,055 square miles, most of it contained in the two main islands of Viti Levu (4,011 square miles) and Vanua Levu (2,137 square miles). About 100 of the total of 844 islands are inhabited. The dependency of Rotuma (17 square miles) lies some 400 miles to the north of Fiji.

Population

The population enumerated in the census of Fiji, 27th September 1956 was 345,737:

- Fijian ........................................... 148,134
- Rotuman ......................................... 4,422
- Other Pacific Islanders ....................... 5,320
- Indian ............................................. 169,403
- European .......................................... 6,402
- Part-European .................................... 7,810
- Chinese and Part-Chinese .................... 4,155
- Others .............................................. 91

The population at the end of 1964 was estimated to be 456,390.

Principal Towns

The principal centres of population are:

| Population (1956 census) |
|--------------------------|
| Suva, the capital city ... 37,371 |
| Lautoka, the largest of the sugar mill centres ... 7,420 |
| Vatukoula, the site of the gold mining industry ... 5,045 |

Geographical Features

The islands comprising the Colony straddle the 180° meridian and lie about 1,200 miles south of the equator. Most of them are of volcanic origin but some are of limestone formation. There are no active volcanoes though hot springs occur in isolated places. All the larger islands are surrounded by coral reefs. Mountain ranges of moderate height—the highest peak is 4,341 feet above sea level—lie athwart the prevailing easterly trade winds and there is consequently a marked difference in the heavy forest vegetation on the windward and the light reeds and grasses on the leeward slopes of most islands. The country is well watered and rivers are numerous. The total forest area is approximately 3,486 square miles.

Climate

The climate is oceanic and tempered by cool east or south-east breezes which blow between May and October. During the rest of the year winds are variable and tropical storms, known locally as hurricanes, may occur. High humidity, which sometimes reaches saturation point, causes unpleasant living conditions while it lasts. Rainfall varies from an annual average of about 120 inches in Suva to 75 inches on the leeward coast of Viti Levu. The diurnal range of temperature at Suva, a few feet above sea level, is about 11°, but recordings between 60° and 90° are not unusual.

History

The first navigator to discover islands in the Fiji archipelago was Tasman in 1643. Cook charted a small island in 1774 and Wilson discovered others in 1797. Bligh of the Bounty recorded most of the Group in 1789 during his memorable voyage in an open boat after being cast adrift by the mutineers.

Christianity was introduced into Fiji by Wesleyan missionaries from Tonga in 1835.

Cakobau (or Thakombau), an influential Fijian chief, offered to cede the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain in 1858 in exchange for support against his rivals and help in meeting his debts, but the offer was refused. After a further unsettled period, Cakobau renewed his offer of cession. The Deed of Cession was signed at Levuka on the 10th October 1874. In 1882 the seat of government was moved to Suva because of its better harbour and greater facilities for expansion.

Rotuma was discovered by Captain Edwards in H.M.S. Pandora in 1791 during his search for the Bounty mutineers. In the nineteenth century the principal Rotuman chiefs repeatedly offered to cede the island to Great Britain, in order to prevent the continuance of a succession of religious wars. Rotuma was formally annexed in 1881.

Constitution

The Government of the Colony is provided for under the Fiji (Constitution) Order in Council 1963 and Royal Instructions. The Executive Council, presided over by the Governor, consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, as ex officio members and seven nominated members, including a European, a Fijian and an Indian from the unofficial members of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Speaker (first appointed in 1956) and consists of not more than nineteen official members and eighteen unofficial members, of whom six are Europeans (four constituency members and two nominated), six Indians (four constituency members and two nominated) and six Fijians (four constituency members and two elected by secret ballot by the Council of Chiefs, itself consisting of elected and nominated members).

A Membership System of government was introduced on 1st July 1964. Under this System, three unofficial members have been appointed to the offices of Member for Natural Resources, Member for Social Services and Member for Communications and Works. A Constitutional Conference was held in London in July 1965 and, subject to the acceptance of proposals as a result of that Conference, the Constitution remains as at present.

A local government system, first established in 1876, and since 1945 known as the Fijian Administration, has jurisdiction over all Fijians in the Colony, a system based on indigenous institutions. At the apex is the Council of Chiefs, presided over by the Secretary for Fijian Affairs and Local Government. In executive control is the Fijian Affairs Board, consisting of the Secretary for Fijian Affairs and Local Government as chairman, the Fijian members of Legislative Council, a Legal Adviser, and a Financial Adviser. The Secretary for Fijian Affairs and Local Government is the executive officer of the Board and he is assisted, in each of the three administrative divisions into which the Colony is divided, by a Commissioner, who is in charge of the division and responsible to the Governor, through the Colonial Secretary, for the efficient administration of his division, including Fijian affairs. District
Officers act as inspectors of the local government units but do not intervene in their management.

In Rotuma, where language and customs differ from those in Fiji, the District Officer is the chief executive authority and he also has limited magisterial powers. A Rotuman Council, consisting of the District Officer and a number of Rotumans, makes regulations of local application. Such regulations shall not have effect unless and until they have been approved by resolution of the Legislative Council.

**Land Policy**

Soon after the date of the cession a commission investigated the title to lands claimed by foreigners and as a result freehold titles to some 400,000 acres of Fijian land were granted. The Fijians now own 84% of the land, the unit of ownership being the mataqali or extended family. Surveys of mataqali holdings have been made following determination of boundaries by Native Land Commissions and a complete record of these family units is maintained. Under the Native Land Trust Ordinance of 1940 the control of all Fijian-owned land is in the hands of an independent Board administered on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Fijian owners. The Board has power to set aside certain areas of land as reserves for the exclusive use of Fijians and to lease land outside such reserves without reference to the owners. The sale of Fijian-owned land is prohibited except to the Crown and then only where it is required for a public purpose. The sale of Crown Land is prohibited except in very special circumstances. Subdivision of land in specified areas is subject to control by a statutory board and development in and around the ten principal urban centres is regulated by Local Authorities in conjunction with a Central Town Planning Board under a Town Planning Ordinance.

**Taxation**

Customs duty and port and customs service tax are levied on most imports. Income tax rates range from 1s. 3d. to 6s. 0d. on each £ of taxable income. Provision is made for personal, married, dependent children and widows' allowances. Companies other than non-Fijian shipping companies are liable for tax at the rate of 5s. 9d. in the £ on profits. Non-Fijian shipping companies are taxed at the rate of 4½d. in the £. In addition to ordinary income tax a Basic Tax is payable by both companies and individuals at the rate of 6d. in the £ of income (before deducting allowances).

Surtax is chargeable on individual incomes at varying rates. Death and gift duties are also payable.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue (£F) | Expenditure (£F) |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1960 | 7,411,115   | 7,052,874        |
| 1961 | 7,445,265   | 7,412,694        |
| 1962 | 8,090,016   | 8,043,167        |
| 1963 | 9,291,805   | 8,611,613        |
| 1964 | 12,001,387  | 10,026,496       |

In 1964 £9,332,265 of total revenue was derived from Customs and excise duties, licences, income tax and other direct taxation. The main heads of expenditure were:

- Public Works Annually Recurrent £1,349,102;
- Medical £1,157,914; Education £1,578,196.

**Currency**

Fiji currency notes are issued by the Fiji Currency Commissioners in denominations of £20, £10, £5, £1, 10s. and 5s.; silver coins in denominations of 2s., 1s., and 6d.; and smaller denominations of 3d., 1d. and ¼d. The Fiji £ is linked to sterling at the rate of £F.111 — £100.

**Development Plans**

A Development Plan covering the period 1964–68 has been drawn up within an overall planning limit of £F. 15m. The sector allocations within this limit are:

| Sector                  | Amount (£F) |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Planning, Survey, Census| 250,000     |
| Communications          | 3,000,000   |
| Economics               | 6,500,000   |
| Social                  | 3,500,000   |
| Miscellaneous           | 1,750,000   |
| **Total**               | **£F.15,000,000** |

**Other Development**

During 1951 at the request of various Fijian Provincial Councils, a Fijian Development Fund was established into which is paid an amount not exceeding £10 a ton from the proceeds of the sale of Fijian-produced copra. Such deposits are credited to the producing group or individual and bear interest at 2½%. The money thus accumulated may be expended only on works or schemes which will benefit the Fijians. The fund is administered by the Fijian Development Fund Board and is being used to provide funds for housing, water supplies, schools, domestic appliances, etc.

**Education**

At the end of the school year 1964 there were 96,725 pupils enrolled in schools, 7,876 of them in post-primary institutions. Both primary and post-primary education was carried on by missions, private bodies and Government. The roll of the Government Training College for Teachers was 187; of the Roman Catholic Training College, 16; and that of the Teacher Training Department of Fulton Missionary College, 26.

There were 587 registered schools where staffing and accommodation were satisfactory and 73 "recognised" schools of a lower standard.

In 1964 there were 3,024 teachers of whom 2,480 were registered. 2,145 of these registered teachers were in Government service.

The number of students studying abroad under scholarship and bursary schemes was 159:

- United Kingdom: 12
- New Zealand: 47
- Australia: 60
- India: 23
- Hawaii: 14
- Canada: 1
- Pakistan: 2

159

During 1964 estimated gross expenditure on education from general revenue amounted to £1,666,896 compared with £43,306 in 1935. When local contributions by school authorities and expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds are taken into account, total expenditure on education during 1964 is estimated to have exceeded £1,800,000.
Libraries and Museums

The Fiji Museum at Suva contains a fine historical and ethnological collection relating to Fiji and Western Pacific Territories. The Carnegie Library and British Council Library at Suva, the Shri Ramkrishna Library at Nandi and the Western Regional Library at Lautoka are the main lending and reference libraries in the Colony. The Fiji Society is concerned with subjects of historic, scientific and antiquarian interest to Fiji.

Health

The principal infectious diseases in Fiji are: influenza, pertussis, infantile diarrhoea and pulmonary tuberculosis. Malaria does not occur. The total bed capacity of hospitals in the Colony is 1,841, of which 1,790 are in Government institutions; there are also 46 dispensaries in the rural areas in charge of Medical Officers. Admissions to Government Hospitals in 1964 numbered about 31,338 and the number of out-patients, including those treated at dispensaries, was 808,630. Leprosy is treated at the Fiji Leprosy Hospital, Makogai, with the most modern methods.

The Fiji School of Medicine (formerly the Central Medical School), founded in 1888, provides a five-year course in medicine and a three-year course in dentistry, together with shorter ancillary courses. In 1964 168 students from 16 territories enrolled in these courses.

The actual expenditure from general revenue on medical services in 1964, inclusive of expenditure on Pacific Medical services, such as the Fiji School of Medicine and the Fiji Leprosy Hospital, Makogai, was £1,129,229 compared with £78,052 in 1935.

Communications

The Colony's main airport is the International Airport at Nadi which is 135 miles by road from Suva. Trans-Pacific air services are operated to and through Fiji from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, United States, Mexico and Tahiti by Canadian Pacific Airlines, Qantas Empire Airways, Air New Zealand, Pan American Airways, Air India, B.O.A.C. and Union de Transport Aeriens. During 1964 there were 4,340 overseas aircraft movements in Fiji.

Regional Air Services to Western Samoa, American Samoa, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, British Solomon Islands, Gilbert and Ellice Islands and the Kingdom of Tonga are operated by Fiji Airways, Union de Transport Aeriens, Pan American Airways and Air New Zealand.

Domestic Air Services within Fiji Group of Islands are operated by Fiji Airways with a fleet of six De Havilland Heron aircraft, one DC.3, one Piper aircraft and one De Havilland Drover. The air fleet of Fiji Airways is based at Nausori Airport, from which a number of these regional air services are operated. Substantial improvements have now been made to this airport to facilitate the operation of larger aircraft of the DC.4 category by day and by night.

There are 440 miles of permanent line on the light railway operated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for bringing sugar cane to the crushing mills. The average annual tonnage transported is about 980,000. A free passenger service is run twice weekly on a section of track 120 miles long. The Colony is also served by a widespread and efficient Bus Transport System. There were 451 buses, 1,033 taxis and 10,188 other vehicles of all types.

There are some 1,034 miles of proclaimed road, 891 miles of which have an all-weather surface.

The chief ports are Suva and Lautoka. During 1964 overseas vessels calling at Suva numbered 477, and at Lautoka 190, some of which also carry passengers. A monthly passenger and cargo service is maintained by the Union Steam Ship Company and connects Suva with Auckland, Tonga and Western Samoa. There is a monthly cargo service from the United Kingdom to New Zealand calling at Suva. Regular inter-island cargo, passenger and mail services are maintained by a small number of motor vessels and there are numerous craft up to about 120 tons operating on irregular itineraries to and from the main centres.

At the end of 1964, there were 141 post offices and agencies, 19 telephone exchanges, and 71 telegraph offices operated by the Posts and Telegraphs Department. Telephone and telegraph facilities are available between the principal towns on the main islands of Viti Levu, and Levuka on the island of Ovalau, with 10,149 telephone subscribers. Outstanding telephone applications numbered 635.

Internal radio-phone and telegraph services are maintained to 66 radio stations, mainly on individual islands throughout the group, and to 68 private and Government ship stations. Suva Post Office radio (VRO and VRP) on both internal and regional telecommunications services, operates a 24-hour watch for both fixed shore and ship stations. External telegraph and telephone communications are provided and operated by the Posts and Telegraphs Department, in co-operation with Cable and Wireless Limited, to most overseas countries via radio links to neighbouring Pacific Island Administrations and the Commonwealth Pacific Telephone Cable (Compac).

Broadcasting

A broadcasting service is undertaken by the Fiji Broadcasting Commission on the following frequencies at the end of December, 1964: VRH, 5 kW. on 890 kc/s; VRH4, 2 kW. on 930 kc/s; VRH3 (Lautoka), 2.5 kW. on 890 kc/s; VRH4, 10 kW. on 4-756 Mc/s in the 60 metre band; VRH5, 10 kW. on 4-785 Mc/s in the 60 metre band; VRH8, 10 kW. on 3-23 Mc/s in the 90-metre band; VRH9, 10 kW. on 3-284 Mc/s in the 90-metre band, and VRH11, 1320 kc/s, 800 watts.

VRH3 (Lautoka) serves the Western Division of Viti Levu and the island of Vanua Levu. This station was opened at Lautoka in December, 1956. The programmes from Suva are relayed to it by a very high frequency radio link. At the end of 1964, there were 33,500 licensed radio receivers.

Principal Occupations

The economy of the Colony is based on agriculture and to a smaller extent on mining. The cultivation of sugar cane is almost entirely in the hands of Indian peasant farmers. Fijians produce about three-fifths of the second important export crop, copra, and about 70% of the employees at the mines are Fijians. The bulk of the population is not, however, a wage-earning one.

At the end of 1964 there were 47 registered Industrial Associations.
Main Crops and Products

Mining is the only substantial non-agricultural industry and the Colony is otherwise wholly dependent upon primary production plus associated industries for coconut oil extraction and processing, cigarette manufacture and butter manufacture. Export income is secured from the sugar industry, from gold and manganese mining and from copra, passion fruit juice and bananas. Almost the whole of the gold and silver output is produced at Vatukoula, where 1,760 persons were employed in 1964. Production was 100,600 ozs. gold and 56,700 ozs. silver. There were 7 manganese mines in production during that year, the total output being 1,000 tons.

Production for local consumption only, which normally closely approaches local needs, includes rice, root crops, such as taro, yams and cassava; fish and livestock products including whole milk and butter, beef, pork, goat flesh and eggs, and miscellaneous fruits and pulses.

The livestock population is estimated at: horses 16,164; cattle 112,986; pigs 22,000; goats 24,000; poultry 170,000.

Timber plantations made in 1964 totalled 2,978 acres, including over 2,100 acres of Mahogany and nearly 800 acres of Pine. Planting is increasing at a steady rate and the total of plantations at the end of 1964 was 10,421 acres. Considerable experimental work is being carried out in the satisfactory establishment of plantations. Four large long-term concessions are operating over 120,000 acres. 62 sawmills were in operation during the year and timber production was 13.9 million super feet sawn. Exports of logs and sawn timber were 2.4 million super feet.

Reef and coastal fishing is undertaken in a small way by Fijians and Indians but the supply of local fish does not nearly meet the demand.

Systematic geological mapping had covered 95% of Viti Levu and 35% of Vanua Levu by the end of 1964, and if reconnaissance surveys are included, preliminary geological data are now available for 90% of the Colony's total land-area. A provisional geological map of Fiji has been prepared on this basis. A mineral exploration programme has also been launched by the Geological Survey, utilising geochemical and diamond drilling methods in a search for new copper and gold deposits. The cost of both geological mapping and mineral exploration is being met from Colonial Development and Welfare and local funds.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

At the close of the year there were 162 registered co-operative societies (1 Chinese, 2 Ellice, 90 Fijian, 3 Gilbertese, 42 Indian, 19 multi-racial and 5 Rotuman). 48 probationary societies (46 Fijian and 2 multi-racial) and 17 unregistered groups (Fijian) were also operating under the guidance and supervision of the department. By type the registered societies comprised 3 agricultural machinery, 21 consumers', 2 consumers' unions, 69 credit, 4 grazing, 11 land-holding, 1 land-holding union, 12 marketing, 1 marketing union, 35 combined marketing and consumers', 1 school managing and two transport. Probationary societies comprised 2 consumers' and 46 combined marketing and consumers'. Unregistered groups comprised 5 consumers' and 12 combined marketing and consumers'. The total membership of the registered societies was 6,055 persons and 122 societies, of the probationary societies it was 1,594 persons and of the unregistered groups 444 persons. Subscribed capital of registered societies was £118,064, of probationary societies £31,639 and of unregistered groups £6,832. The total turnover of all co-operatives in produce marketed and in sales of consumer goods was 1,207,787. The principal crop handled was copra and most of it was sold to local crushing mills. Sugar cane, which is not handled by co-operatives, is sold to South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd. The export of bananas to New Zealand is controlled by the Banana Marketing Board which issues licenses to various shippers including individual growers, co-operatives, Fijian village organisation and a few entrepreneurs.
