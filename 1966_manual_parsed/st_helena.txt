ST. HELENA

Situation and Area

The island is situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, 700 miles south-east of Ascension and about 1,200 miles from the south-west coast of Africa. It is 10½ miles long and 6½ miles broad, covering an area of 47 square miles.

Population

The estimated population at the 31st December 1964 was 4,676. It is largely descended from settlers and others of British origin and persons of Asian or African blood who were introduced by the East India Company. The language of the Island has always been English and the English way of life has become firmly established.

Principal Town

Jamestown, the capital, is the only town and has a population of some 1,600.

Geographical Features

St. Helena is rugged and mountainous and of volcanic origin. The highest peak, Mt. Actaeon, rises to 2,685 feet. There are no rivers or streams but there is a good supply of fresh spring water.

Climate

The cool South Atlantic trade winds blow throughout the year. The climate is mild and varies little, the temperature in Jamestown, on the sea-coast, ranging in summer between 70° and 85°, and in winter between 65° and 75°. Inland it is some 10° cooler. The annual rainfall varies from an average of about 8 inches in Jamestown to between 22 and 38 inches inland.

History

St. Helena, then uninhabited, was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese commander, Juan de Nova Castella. Its existence appears to have remained unknown to other European nations until 1588 when it was visited by Captain Cavendish on his return from a voyage round the world. Soon afterwards the island became a port of call for ships of various nations voyaging between the East Indies and Europe. In 1633 the Dutch formally annexed it but made no attempt to occupy it. In 1659 it was annexed and occupied on behalf of the East India Company but the first official authorization of the Company's occupation occurs in a charter dated 1661. In January 1673 the Dutch seized the Island but were driven out again in May by the English navy. A Charter to occupy and govern the Island was issued by Charles II to the East India Company in December 1673 and it remained under that Company until April 1834 when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833. Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled in St. Helena from 1815 until his death in 1821.

Constitution

An Order in Council and Royal Instructions of 1956, as amended by additional Royal Instructions of 1963, provide for (1) an Executive Council consisting of the Government Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer as ex officio members, not more than two other official members and not more than three unofficial members at least one of whom must be an elected member of the Advisory Council; and (2) an Advisory Council consisting of the Government Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer as ex officio members, two other official members, four nominated unofficial members and eight elected members. The legislative authority is the Governor, acting after consultation with the Advisory Council; power is reserved to Her Majesty in Council to legislate by Order.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation. Crown land may be disposed of on conditions approved by the Governor.

Taxation

An Income Tax Ordinance came into force on the 1st January 1954. The rate for individuals is 1s. 3d. in the £ on the first £1,500 and at the rate of 1s. 9d. in the £ on any excess of £1,500 derived from local sources.

In the case of a married person who can prove to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Income Tax that his wife was living with him or wholly maintained by him during the year immediately preceding the year of assessment there is an abatement of one-third of the tax. A Personal Tax of £5 per person is also payable by those whose income is above £380 and who do not qualify for the payment of Income Tax. Import duties are confined to a very small range of goods. There are also taxes on motor vehicles, shops and entertainments.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1960 | 195,606    | 188,276        |
| 1961 | 258,132    | 291,541        |
| 1962 | 303,105    | 290,477        |

| 1964 | 323,237    | 320,767        |

In 1964, the revenue derived from import and export duties (£34,048) was about 10·5% and Post Office revenue (including Ascension) was about 2·5% of local revenue. In the same year the main heads of expenditure (excluding Colonial Development and Welfare expenditure) were:

| Head of Expenditure       | Amount (£) | Percentage |
|---------------------------|------------|-----------|
| Public Health             | 25,486     | 8         |
| Education                 | 19,626     | 6         |
| Public Works              | 46,155     | 14·4      |
| Agriculture and Forestry  | 16,698     | 5·2       |
Currency

The Colony's currency consists of Bank of England notes and United Kingdom coins which are legal tender in the United Kingdom. South African currency is also accepted in the Colony. The amount of currency in circulation at the end of 1964 was estimated at £50,000.

Development Plans

A further allocation of £150,000 has been provided for an extension of the development programme to cover the years 1963 to 1966 which will be financed almost entirely from a grant under the Colonial Development and Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1959.

While a considerable proportion of the funds are being devoted to road improvement and to development in agriculture, other phases of the programme include housing, extension of the electrical distribution system, teacher training, school meals and school playgrounds.

Education

Education is compulsory and is provided free for all children between the ages of 5 and 15 years.

In 1964 there were eight primary schools, two of which provided all-age education; three secondary schools and one selective secondary school. During 1964 1,169 children of school age were taught in these schools.

The expenditure on educational services during 1964 was £23,183, of which £3,557 was contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. In 1935 the expenditure was £980.

Library

There is a free Public Library financed by Government and managed by a Committee.

Health

The Island is very healthy and none of the ordinary tropical diseases are endemic. There is one hospital in Jamestown with 60 beds, the number of in-patients during 1964 totalling 851. There are six out-patient dispensaries at convenient centres in the Island which are regularly visited by the doctors and the midwife and district nurse. A mental hospital with 22 beds is situated a little way out of Jamestown.

During 1964 £25,486 was spent on medical services compared with £2,637 in 1935.

Communications

Under normal conditions ships of the Union Castle Line call at intervals of four weeks—both on their way from England to South Africa and on their journey from South Africa homewards. These are the only regular mails. Air mail letters are carried by sea to Cape Town or to London and thence by air to their destinations. The Island has an internal telephone system. Cable and Wireless, Limited, operate a cable and radio telephone station connecting with Cape Town and Ascension.

In 1964, 17 merchant ships with a total tonnage of 163,017 called at St. Helena.

Some 65 miles of roads in the Island are all-weather roads for motor traffic.

There is no broadcasting service in the Colony.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population who are not in regular employment by Government or in the flax mills are engaged in agriculture. There is one general trade union. The principal categories of employees are:

- Workers in the flax industry: 267
- Agricultural labourers: 182
- Skilled and general labourers: 250
- Mechanics, engine- and motor-drivers: 30
- Building tradesmen and apprentices: 53
- Fishermen and boatmen: 30

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are flax, common and sweet potatoes and vegetables.

The livestock population is:

- Horses: 25
- Donkeys: 925
- Cattle: 686
- Sheep: 1,168
- Goats: 1,230
- Pigs: 270
- Poultry: 9,904

Fish of many kinds are plentiful in the waters around St. Helena but the catch is usually insufficient to meet the demand.

The only industry is the manufacture of fibre, tow, rope and twine. Five flax mills were in operation during 1964.

ASCENSION

The island of Ascension, 34 square miles in
area, lying in the South Atlantic, latitude 7° 56' S.,
and longitude 14° 22' W., was taken possession
of in 1815; until 1922 it was under the super-
vision of the Admiralty and a small naval station
was maintained there.

The population at 31st December 1964 was 581
of whom 401 were St. Helenians and 86 West
Indians.

By Letters Patent dated 12th September 1922
(since superseded by Order in Council of 22nd
March 1956) it was made a Dependency of St.
Helena and placed under the control of the
Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Ascension is a barren, rocky peak of purely
volcanic origin, and destitute of vegetation, except
at the highest point (2,870 feet), but has been
cultivated to an extent permitting the maintenance
of about 900 sheep and cattle. It is famous for
its turtles, large numbers of which visit between
December and May.

Cable and Wireless Limited own and operate
an important cable station which connects the
Dependency with St. Helena, Sierra Leone, St.
Vincent, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, and
through these places, over the Company's system,
with all parts of the world.

In 1942 the Government of the United States
of America, by arrangement with His Majesty's
Government, established an air base which became
of considerable importance during the period of
hostilities. The United States Government has
recently reoccupied Wideawake Airfield by agree-
ment with the Government of St. Helena in
connexion with the extension of the Long Range
Proving Ground for guided missiles centred in
Florida.

Work on the construction of a British Broad-
casting Corporation relay station on the island
began in 1964.

Administrator—Major J. M. E. Wainwright.

TRISTAN DA CUNHA, etc.

Tristan da Cunha is a small island in the South Atlantic Ocean, lying about midway between South America and South Africa. It is volcanic in origin and nearly circular in shape, covering an area of 38 square miles and rising in a cone to 670 feet. The climate is typically oceanic and temperate. Rainfall averages 66 inches per annum.

The Island was taken possession of in 1816 during Napoleon's residence in St. Helena, and a garrison was stationed there. When the garrison was withdrawn, three men, headed by Corporal William Glass, elected to remain and became the founders of the present settlement. Because of its position on a main sailing route the colony thrived until the 1880s, but with the replacement of sail by steam, the Island ceased to occupy a position on the main shipping route and a period of decline set in. No regular shipping called and the Islanders suffered at times from a shortage of food. Nevertheless, attempts to move the inhabitants to South Africa were unsuccessful. The Islanders were engaged chiefly in fishing and agricultural pursuits.

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel have maintained a missionary teacher on the Island since 1922; a number of missionaries had also served on the Island prior to this. In 1932 the missionary was officially recognized as Honorary Commissioner and Magistrate.

By Letters Patent dated 12th January 1938 Tristan da Cunha and the neighbouring unsettled islands of Nightingale, Inaccessible and Gough were made dependencies of St. Helena, though as a matter of practical convenience the administration of the group has continued to be directly supervised by the Colonial Office.

In 1942 a meteorological and wireless station was built on the Island by a detachment of the South African Defence Force and was manned by the Royal Navy for the remainder of the war. The coming of the Navy re-introduced the Islanders to the outside world, for it was a naval chaplain who recognised the possibilities of a crawfish industry on Tristan da Cunha, and in 1948 a Cape Town-based fishing company was granted a concession to fish the Tristan da Cunha waters on certain conditions which included the maintenance on the Island of a doctor, nurse, agriculturist and teacher. Many of the Islanders found employment with the fishing company and were able to convert their wages into goods in the canteen run by the company. In 1950 the office of Administrator was created. The Administrator is also the magistrate.

On 10th October 1961 a volcanic cone erupted close to the Settlement of Edinburgh, and it became necessary to evacuate the Island. All the Islanders were brought to the United Kingdom where new homes were provided for them. In April 1962 a scientific expedition organised by the Royal Society visited the islands, followed in October 1962 with a visit by an exploratory party to determine whether the Settlement was habitable and the beaches usable and safe; it was determined that the Island was suitable for re-settlement and that those Islanders who wished to return could do so. In 1963, the majority of the Islanders returned to Tristan da Cunha, accompanied by an Administrator, a doctor, a Chaplain and three other officers. The population at the end of 1964 was 278.

The Island is still isolated and communications are restricted to a few calls a year by fishing vessels and an occasional call by a passing ship. There is, however, a newly-equipped wireless station which is in constant touch with the outside world. The Island has also been supplied with generators for supplying electricity, a motor cargo boat, hospital equipment, livestock and other necessities. The administration has been fully re-established on the Island and the Island Council reformed.

The main landing beaches, on which the Island community depended for their livelihood from fishing, were destroyed by the volcanic eruption in 1961, as a result of which it was evident that alternative landing facilities would have to be provided if the future economic stability of the Island community was to be ensured. It was considered that the construction of a small harbour would be the best means of enabling the fishing industry to start up again and the harbour, for which H.M.G. provided a grant of £80,000, is now being built under the direction of the Secretary of State's Adviser on Engineering, by the Islanders. When this is completed in 1966, it is expected that the company holding the local fishing concession will rebuild their fish-freezing factory on the Island, the original one having been buried under the lava, and re-establish a shore-based fishing industry.

Administrator—G. H. Whitefield, M.B.E.
