TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.

Extent and Boundaries.

The territory which was comprised in German East Africa extends from the Umba river on the North to Cape Delgado on the South, the coast line being about 470 miles in length. The Northern Boundary runs approximately N.W. to Lake Victoria Nyanza at the intersection of the first parallel of Southern latitude with the east shore (Mohurn Point), and the Southern to the Northern end of Lake Nyasa and thence to the Southern end of Lake Tanganyika. The boundary on the west with the Belgian Congo follows the shore of Lake Kivu, the River Rusisi, and the whole length of Lake Tanganyika. The total area is about 385,000 square miles.

General Description.

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,590 feet, Nyasa, 1,607 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending Northwards to Lake Naivasha.
The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam which lies along the Northern and North Western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. The entrance to Tanga bay has only about 3 feet at low water, but plans have been made to improve it. The most notable towns in the interior are Ujiji, on Lake Tanganyika, and Tabora, which lies at a junction of roads converging from the coast, Nyanza and Tanganyika. Moshi, about 75 miles from Voi on the Uganda Railway, lies 4,800 feet above the sea on the southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, and is very healthy for Europeans. Kilimanjaro (19,391 feet) and Mount Meru (14,960 feet) are rugged masses of volcanic origin.

Lake Tanganyika is 400 miles long and from 40 to 100 miles broad; after Lake Baikal, it is the deepest lake in the world, the greatest depth being 4,758 feet. About seven German steamers plied on it. Lake Nyasa is about 300 miles long by 15 to 55 broad; only the Northern part abuts on the Territory. Victoria Nyanza is 220 miles long and broad, the Southern half being in the Territory. There are four smaller lakes, and numerous rivers.

There are few good roads, and porter transport is generally necessary.

It is understood that the provinces of Ruanda and Urundi, on the western side of the Territory, will be administered by Belgium, but an arrangement has been made under which strips of these provinces are transferred to Great Britain, so as to facilitate the construction of a railway from Tabora, on the Dar-es-Salaam line, to Uganda.

Climate.

Generally speaking the rainfall is low for a tropical country and in some years there are great droughts. There are three types of climate, (1) the Indian or trade wind type, which prevails over the greater part. It has one rainy season, from December to April. The hottest period is in November. (2) The monsoon type, prevailing in the N.E. There are two rainy seasons, the heaviest being from March to May and the lesser in November. The hottest month is February. (3) The equatorial type prevailing in the N.W. It has two warmer and two cooler seasons, the warmer being October and February, March (i.e., when the sun is above the Equator), and the cooler July and November–December. The rainy season is October–May, (Nyanza) or November–April (Tanganyika). The average yearly temperature in the coast region is 78° F.

History.

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made twelve treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905, and was not put down till after about eighteen months, it is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results. It was alleged that the trouble was due to misgovernment and Labour Taxes, and in 1907 Herr Dernburg, then Colonial Minister, came out to investigate. His recommendations were adopted and subsequently the natives had more confidence in the Government. The chief taxes were the hut tax (3 rs. a year) and the poll tax, payable in money, in labour, or in kind.

Population.

The white population on 1st January, 1912, was 4,866. The natives are estimated at 7,500,000 and represent a number of ethnographical types. The earliest inhabitants succumbed to Bantu invasions which supplied the basis of the population, and much later a great wave of Hamitic-Semitic peoples is supposed to have come over the Red Sea from Arabia. The Masai are Hamitic a race of splendid physique and occupied with cattle rearing and fighting. Zulus penetrated into the country about the middle of the nineteenth century. The Swahilis on the coast are a mixture of Bantu and Arab.

Most of the natives are pagans, with a very low type of religion. There are numerous missionary stations, German and British, which have done a good deal for education.

Swahili is a kind of "lingua franca" in the whole region and far beyond. It became the medium of trade from being the language of Zanzibar, the immemorial gate between East Africa and the outer world.

Products and Trade.

| Imports | Exports | Total |
|---------|---------|-------|
| 1912    | £2,515,000 | 1,570,000 | 4,085,000 |

The chief items of export are rubber (£239,050 in 1911), sisal (£226,600), hides (£151,750), copra (92,250), cotton (66,600), coffee (63,300). Most of the rubber is produced in plantations of European owners, generally from the Manihot Glaziouii, which yields at the early age of three years. Plantations to the value of £1,200,000 in the Usambara Valley are owned by British capital. Sisal is grown entirely on plantations; the crop is suitable to the country and the hemp is of very good quality. Cotton was greatly encouraged by the German Government, but was not very successful, owing to serious diseases and to the fact that the tsetse fly makes it impossible in many districts to use oxen. The natives produce numerous cereals and vegetables. Wages in the Usambara valley were 12-15 Rs. a month, but the supply of labour was unequal to the demand. Cattle farming in the hinterland has been a profitable occupation. Mica is the chief mineral product and is of good quality, some coal of good quality has been found, and several places are worth mining for gold. The ivory trade declined after 1909, probably owing to new game laws.

Communications.

The Northern Railway starts from Tanga and runs into the Kilimanjaro hill-country to New Moshi (222 miles). The Central Railway from Dar-es-Salaam goes to Kigoma, near Ujiji, on Tanganyika (780 miles). Gauge of both, 1 metre, steepest gradient, 1 in 40. There is a light railway from Tengeni on the Northern Railway to Zigi (12½ miles), and some other short lines.

Currency and Banking.

The German Government issued local rupees of the Indian standard, and subsidiary coins, also rupee notes, but these have been declared not to be legal tender. Indian one-rupee notes are also legal tender. It is contemplated to introduce special British East Africa currency on a sterling basis.

The banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa and the National Bank of South Africa.
