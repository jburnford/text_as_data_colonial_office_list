WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, New South Wales, or New Zealand, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1907, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the
New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Phoenix Group.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

**THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.**

The following groups and islands which were formerly under British protection were formed into a Colony at the request of the natives, by His Majesty's Orders in Council of 10th November, 1915 and 27th January and 29th February, 1916.

**Ocean Island, or Paanopa,** in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, was included in the jurisdiction of the Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Protectorate in 1900. It is the Head-quarters of the Government and the site of operations by the Pacific Phosphate Company, whose European employees there number about 80. The natives of the island, who are closely allied to the Gilbertese, are decreasing in numbers owing to European conditions. Labour for the phosphate operations is procured from the Gilbert Group, and from Japan. The operations of the Company have been considerably curtailed owing to the late war.

A Wireless Station was erected at Ocean Island in 1916. The total population of the Colony is approximately 33,000 including about 200 Europeans and 300 Asiatics.

The Gilbert and Ellice Groups contain 16 inhabited islands in the former and eight in the latter group. They consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 4° N. latitude and 10° S. and 170° to 180° E. longitude. The principal export is copra which is steadily increasing.

The natives, who number about 30,000, are of Malayo-Polynesian race, the majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government presided over by a native magistrate. A revised code of native laws is validated by an ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials. Revenue is obtained from a land, or copra tax, trading licences, import duties, non-native capitation tax, etc., which covers the cost of maintaining a regular government. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups.
The Union Group consists of three coral atolls about 9° S. latitude and 170° W. longitude. The natives are of the Polynesian race and number about 1,000. The language is closely allied to that of the Ellice Group. Nearly all the natives are adherents of the London Missionary Society or of the Roman Catholic Samoan Mission. Copra is the only export. Native governments have been established as in the Gilbert and Ellice Groups. A European official supervises the Ellice and Union Groups, but communication between the two groups is limited to about three calls a year.

Fanning and Washington Islands lie about 3° 51' N. latitude and 159° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but the Fanning Island Company employ about 400 Gilbert natives in the copra industry. A resident European official has lately been placed in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner for the Colony. The Pacific Cable Board has its Mid Ocean Station on Fanning Island. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small steamer of the Fanning Island Company.

Christmas Island (1° 57' N., 157° 27' W.) is the largest atoll in the Pacific. It has been planted with coconuts, but is usually uninhabited.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work has been undertaken of late years and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. Every Island has a native hospital under the charge of a native student trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

The Revenue and Expenditure of the Colony have been as follows:

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanal, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ongtong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 13th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. The native population has been estimated, approximately, at 150,000, but is decreasing. Large numbers were carried off by dysentery during the eighteen months ended March 31st, 1915. Malaita is the most densely populated, but dysentery and fighting among its inhabitants has greatly reduced the numbers. The natives have been described as treacherous; some tribes are still head-hunters and cannibals. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped by legislation. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philip and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts in March, 1914, amounted to 30,000 acres. The non-native population in 1914 numbered 660 Europeans, and in 1919 numbered 675 Europeans and 75 Asiatics. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893. The British Resident Commissioner has his headquarters at Tulagi, a small island between Guadalcanal and Malaita, where there is a Customs House and Post Office. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, at Mala, at Gizo, San Cristoval, Guadalcanal and Ysabel. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

**TONGA**

Area 250 sq. miles.

Population:
- Europeans: 376
- Half-castes: 250
- Tongans: 22,689
- Others: 247
- Total: 25,362

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, are situated between the 20th and 23rd degrees of south latitude. The islands are most of them of coral formation, but include some active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafouo (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. Bananas and oranges are also exported from Vavau, in the northern part of the group. There is regular steam communication with Auckland via Fiji (1,000 miles distant), Sydney (1,850 miles), and Fiji, and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles).

The late king George Tubou I, was the first of its chiefs or kings to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga. The king is assisted by a native parliament and a privy council. With the exception of a few Europeans in the Treasury, Education, and Medical Departments, the whole of the Government officers are Tongans. The tariff resembles that of Fiji, and licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades. The revenue and expenditure in 1917-18 amounted to 58,340l. and 35,865l., and in 1918-19 the revenue amounted to 66,901l. and the expenditure to 43,688l. respectively. According to the official returns the imports and exports were:

| Year | Imports | Exports |

The shipping in 1914 amounted to—Entered, 57,474 tons; cleared, 54,099 tons. The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are five churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years), with at present about 3,000 adherents only; the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents; the "Free Church of England," the number of whose adherents is unknown; and the Church of England. The Free Church of Tonga was established in
1885, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakaogo," i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier, an ex-Wesleyan missionary. Six persons charged with complicity in the attempt were shot. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaogos," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakaogo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuahoe). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufaahau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917, to Prince Viliami Tugi, Governor of Vavau and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed by Mr. Thomson, in Tonga, and, by consent of the chiefs, in Savage Island also.

In December, 1904, and January, 1905, the High Commissioner, Sir Everard in Thurn, spent some time in Tonga, re-organising the system of administration—which had by that time fallen into some disorder, and receiving an undertaking from the king of more strict compliance with the liabilities assumed by him under the Treaty of 1890. The Premier, Jiosateki Toga Veikune, and the Treasurer were removed to Fiji, under an Order in Council; and Jione Mateialona was appointed to the Premiership, which office he held until 30th September, 1912, when he resigned. Since that date the appointment has been held by Devita Bolutele Kaho, Tui Vakano. The progress of Tonga, since 1905 has been satisfactory.

All the natives are taught to read and write, and higher education is provided by colleges established by the Government and by the Wesleyan Mission.

British and foreign subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine and local police, not recognised as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

Agent and Consul, Tonga, Islay McOwan, 800l. and quarters; entertainment allowance 100l., and allowance of 50l. as Consul.

The foregoing Ministers constitute the Privy Council, meetings of which are presided over by the Queen.

The Cabinet Council is composed of the same Ministers, with the exception of the Minister of the Crown.

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The population has been estimated at from 100,000 to 140,000, but the Mission returns place it at only 50,000. Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church. There is a European population of about 630, mostly British and French. The principal exports are copra, maize, and coffee; timber and sulphur are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on the 20th October, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and
of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers have been appointed.

**PHOENIX GROUP.**

The Phoenix group comprises Phoenix, Birnie, Hull, Canton, Gardner, McKean, Enderbury and Sydney Islands, and is situated to the east of the Gilbert and Ellice groups. The Islands are of coral formation, and several of them are planted with coconuts. All except McKean and Enderbury Islands are leased to the Samoan Trading and Shipping Company for 87 years, from 1st January, 1914.

**PITCAIRN ISLAND.**

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population in 1914 was 140 (35 adult males, 39 adult females, 66 children).

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, G. B. Christian.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.

Nauru (0° 26' S., 166° 56' E.), or Pleasant Island, an uplifted atoll, was discovered by Captain Fearn in 1798, and was annexed by Germany in 1888. It has an area of about eight square miles, and a native population of 1,400. A number of Chinese are employed in working the great deposits of phosphate-rock, which, under an Agreement dated 2nd July, 1919, will be exploited jointly by the Imperial Government and the Governments of Australia and New Zealand. Coconuts are extensively cultivated. A wireless station is in operation.

Nauru was surrendered to H.M.A.S. "Melbourne" in November, 1914, and, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, has since been administered under the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. Administrator, G. W. B. Smith-Rewse.

**THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.**

**Situation, Area, and Trade.**

The Windward Islands consist of the three islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically. The three first-named islands are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the three Colonies is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and their estimated population at 31st December, 1917, 177,653.

**History.**

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.
On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia, the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois. In Grenada the same condition obtains, but to a less extent.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and, when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados and a common audit system instituted in 1889.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank" and "Royal Bank of Canada," which have branches in the larger islands, issue five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

Communications.

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 14 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Port of Spain for the purpose of transhipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call fortnightly at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Trinidad Shipping and Trading Company, Grenada being the first and last port of call. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's Canadian line of steamers call regularly at Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent, and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telephone system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe, the United States, Canada, and the other West Indian islands by cable to Havana and Bermuda. The rate per word for telegrams to the United Kingdom from Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent is 2s. 6d. The rate to Europe varies from 2s. 9d. to 3s. 4½d. per word. (Government messages pay half rates). Government messages are always routed via Bermuda.
