SEYCHELLES.

Situation, Area and Climate.

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the estimated total number of square miles comprised in the group and in the dependencies of Seychelles is 1564. The number of islands under the Seychelles Government is 90.

Mahé is distant from Mauritius 934, from Madagascar 600, and from Zanzibar 970 miles. It is mountainous, fertile, and extremely healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 84, and falls frequently at night to 68, and the records taken on the hills are several degrees lower. The rainfall at Victoria, Mahé, was in 1918, 82·79 inches.

The death-rate in 1918 was 17·04 per 1,000; the birth-rate being 28·13 per 1,000.

Geography.

Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 4 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to contain 55½ square miles. It has about 106 miles of good roads and paths, and communication between all the districts of the island is easy.

It rises abruptly from the sea, and the highest peak reaches the elevation of 2,997 feet. The capital of the island, now called Victoria, is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a safe and commodious harbour, provided with a lighthouse showing fixed red light.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse (900 acres); Félicité (800 acres); North Island (525 acres); St. Anne (500 acres); Providence (500 acres); Frigate (500 acres); Denis (340 acres); Corf (290 acres); and Bird or Sea Cow Island (160 acres).

The following islands are also dependencies of Seychelles:—The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, and the Aldabra Islands.

The island of Coëtivy, formerly a dependency of Mauritius, was transferred to Seychelles by Letters Patent in 1907.

History.

The islands are believed to have been discovered by a Portuguese named Pedro Mascaregnas, in 1505, but the discovery was not apparently followed by any attempt at colonisation.

Previous to the French occupation they were the resort of pirates or corsairs who infested the Indian Ocean, some of whose names are borne by descendants in Mahé at the present time.

Under the Government at Mauritius of Labourdonnais, whose name they originally bore, their position was first defined in 1743, and M. Picault, who took possession of the Islands in the name of the King of France, called the principal island Mahé. Later on the group was re-named the Seychelles Islands, in honour of the Vicomte Moreau des Sèchelles, who was Controller-General of Finance under Louis XV., from 1754 to 1756. The Islands were named in 1756 by a Lieut. Morphy, who was sent to Mahé by Magon de la Villebague.

The natural resources of the Islands, and their freedom from hurricanes, induced the French to transplant from the Isle de France (now Mauritius) cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs, under the directions of M. Poivre. Much secrecy was at first observed in regard to the existence of these retired plantations, the object being to wrest from the Dutch the lucrative spice monopoly which the colonies of that nation then enjoyed in Europe from their own possessions.

The rumours of the war that broke out between France and England in 1778, induced the then French Governor of Mauritius, Count de Souillac, to issue peremptory orders that in the event of an attack the spice plantations should be at once destroyed. Soon afterwards a French ship from Madagascar, having slaves on board, called at Mahé to take in wood and water, but fearing that the English might be in possession, adopted the ruse of hoisting the English flag. The small French force at Mahé had already been withdrawn, and the officer in charge, knowing that resistance was useless, at once set fire to the whole of the spice trees, each of which had previously been surrounded with dry wood and inflammable material.

During the war of the French Revolution Mahé was extremely useful to French ships as a place of refuge and refitment, but on the 17th May, 1794, it was captured by Captain Newcome, of His Majesty's ship "Orpheus."

The last French Governor, Mr. De Quincy, who was born at Paris in November, 1748, became, after Lieutenant Sullivan, R.M., who had been placed in charge, had left, the first Agent Civil under the British Government. Mr. De Quincy's reign as French Governor lasted twenty years. He remained for eighteen years in the service of the British Government, and died on the 10th July, 1827.

The capitulation was renewed in 1806 by Capt. Ferrier, of His Majesty's ship "Albion," but it was not until the capture of Mauritius in 1810, that Seychelles was formally taken possession of by the appointment of an Agent, and incorporated as a dependency of that Colony. From 1794 to 1810 Seychelles, though nominally a British Colony, seems to have been administered as a French Colony, and all Civil Status Acts ran in the name of the French Government. A Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed in 1872, when the finances of the Seychelles were separated from those of Mauritius. The title of the Head of the Government was changed from that of Civil Commissioner to that of Chief Civil Commissioner. The powers of the Board were further enlarged in 1874 by another Order in Council.

The increasing importance of these islands was considered sufficient to warrant an alteration in the constitution of the Government, and in December, 1888, an Order in Council was passed creating the office of Administrator, and nominating an Executive and Legislative Council. In 1897, by Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, the Administrator was given full powers as Governor, and Seychelles was practically separated from Mauritius. The separation was completely carried out by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, by which Seychelles was erected into a separate Colony under its own Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

An education grant of Rs. 12,000 is given in assisting schools of all denominations, of which there were 22 in 1918, attended by 2,217 children. The Government maintains a secondary school (King's College), a preparatory school (Victoria School) and a Free School, with technical classes, which are undenominational. All other schools are denominational.
Communications, &c.

The British India Company's steamers call regularly once a month from Bombay to East African Ports. Men-of-war of all nationalities sometimes visit Mahé. The Admiralty use Victoria as a coaling station, and passing steamers can always procure coal. Seychelles is now included in the Cape of Good Hope Naval Station.

Telegraphic communication with Mauritius and Europe via Zanzibar was completed in November, 1893. The rates for telegrams from Seychelles are 75 cts. per word to Mauritius or Zanzibar, Rs. 1.50 to Aden, and Rs. 1.90 to Europe.

The present letter rate of postage to the United Kingdom, India and those Colonies and Protectorates which have adopted the Imperial Penny Postage is 12 cents; to other countries of the Postal Union 15 cents. The parcels post has been in full operation since April, 1890. The cash on delivery service for parcel post was introduced in 1911. The money order system is in operation with England and numerous other countries and colonies, including Bombay, Aden, Zanzibar, Mauritius and Ceylon.

Savings Bank and Currency.

A Government Savings bank was established in March, 1897, and at the close of the year 1917 Rs. 94,661 were upon deposit. All the Savings Bank funds are invested. There is a Branch Savings Bank at Praslin. The branches which were established at Anse Royale and La Digue were closed during 1906, as there were no transactions.

The currency consists of the Indian rupee and the Mauritius subsidiary coinage. Accounts are kept in rupees and cents. There is a small local note issue, limited to Rs. 15,000 in one rupee and ½ rupee notes. Notes of the Mauritius Government also circulate freely.

Local Boards.

A Local Board of Health, vested with powers and duties somewhat similar to those entrusted to Municipal Bodies, was created in Victoria at the end of 1900. Similar Boards were created for the Islands of Praslin and La Digue at the end of 1901, and for the South Mahé District in March, 1902.

Revenue, Trade, Products, &c.

The revenue is derived principally from specific import duties, which are light, and an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. on articles not otherwise enumerated, except "articles de mode," the ad valorem duty on which is 8 per cent. (10 per cent. surtax of Customs duty has been imposed for the period of the War), licences, a capitation tax and a tax on immovable property and stamps. An export duty of Rs. 1 a ton is levied on guano, prepared fertiliser, and mangrove bark, and an export duty of Rs. 2 a ton on cinnamon bark, and Rs. 1 per hectolitre of whale oil, an export duty varying from Rs. 10 to Rs. 5 per ton is levied on copra, according to price of that commodity in Marseilles. There is also a small export duty on essential oils, and a fixed export duty of Rs. 2·50 per kilo. on tortoise shells (caret).

In 1918 the chief exports were copra, 649 tons; guano, 2,470 tons; vanilla, 11 tons; tortoise shell, 215½ tons; soap, 1½ tons; calippe, ½ ton; coconut oil, 44,917 gallons; essential oils, 3,100 gallons.

A Botanic Station in Victoria and experimental plantations in the Niol Forest and Capucins have greatly aided in the improvement of methods of cultivation, and the introduction of new products. The Para rubber tree has been found to thrive well in all parts of Mahé, and in many other islands belonging to Seychelles.

More especially at Praslin, though also in other parts of the group, are to be found the celebrated coco-de-mer, with the leaves of which beautiful hats and delicate basket work are made by the natives.

The Aldabra group of islands under the Seychelle administration is the habitat of the gigantic land tortoises; numerous living specimens are, however, to be seen in Mahé and the neighbouring islands, and there are over sixty, large and small, in the tortoise pens at Government House.

There are lighthouses on Denis Island and Mamelles Island (9 miles north-east of Mahé in long. 55° 32' 20" E., and lat. 4° 29' S.), and in Victoria Harbour. A new light has also been installed on Point Capucin, the southernmost cape of Mahé. The quarantine station is placed on Long Island opposite to Victoria.
