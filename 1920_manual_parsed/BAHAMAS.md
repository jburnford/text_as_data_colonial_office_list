BAHAMAS.

Situation and Area.
The Bahamas, the most northerly of the British West Indian Colonies, are a chain of coral islands lying between 21° 42' and 27° 34' N. lat., and 72° 40' and 79° 5' W. long., composed of about 20 inhabited islands, and an immense number of islets and rocks. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Cat Island (or San Salvador), Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, the Biminis, and Watling's Island, all of which are ports of entry; and Great Bahamas, Crooked Island, Aokin Island, Mayaguana, the Berry Islands, and Andros Island (containing the only river). The total area is 4,403½ square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

History.
San Salvador, so called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had any settlements on any of the islands of this group at any time. Early in the 17th century the islands were well known to the settlers of Bermuda and the Carolinas. They were included in the Royal Grant of Sir Robert Heath, the Attorney-General of England, of the 30th of October, 1629. By 1640 the islands had become a well-known place of resort by the inhabitants of Bermuda, and on the 9th of July, 1647, The Company of Eleutherian Adventurers was formed in London for the purpose of making an organised attempt at a systematic colonization and development of the islands. William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, was the moving spirit of this venture, and associated with him were a number of influential city merchants and Members of Parliament. On the 31st of August, 1649, Parliament, on the petition of Sayle and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands," which constituted
Sayle and his associates the Proprietors of the Islands. Notwithstanding the Royal Grant to Heath in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles the Second, on the 1st of November, 1670, granted the Islands to Six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, namely, the Duke of Albemarle, the Earl of Craven, Lord Berkley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret and Sir Peter Colleton. Before the Royal Grant of 1670 the inhabitants of the islands had organised the Settlement and instituted a form of Government which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected Captain John Wentworth as their Governor. Wentworth applied to and received Commissions from the Governors of Jamaica. The Lords Proprietors appointed Hugh Wentworth as their first Governor on 24th April, 1671, but he did not take up the appointment. They then confirmed in office John Wentworth, the popularly elected Governor, on the 26th of December, 1671. A regular system of government was established including a Parliament, the Lower House of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the Civil and Military Government of the Islands was resumed by the Crown on the 20th October, 1718. Thirteen Proprietary Governors were appointed between 1671 and 1715. The Settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 nearly all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the Settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica, under the leadership of Thomas Bridges. Bridges was recognised as Governor by the Lords Proprietors on the 12th July, 1688, and the Settlement had reached some importance when it was practically annihilated by the French and Spaniards in 1703. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned to New Providence and another Proprietary Governor was appointed in 1707. But the Islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the Civil and Military Government of the place, and thus accede to the numerous petitions which the inhabitants had been making for several years and also carry out the express wishes of Parliament. Since 1718 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The Islands were surrendered to a Fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1781, but they had been re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux before the conclusion of the war, which was brought to an end by the Peace of Versailles, 1783, when the British possession was confirmed. After the American Revolution a great number of Loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas Group and received substantial assistance from England, and on the 19th of March, 1787, the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of 12,000l., which was provided by Parliament.

The Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, and which had often in their early history been claimed both by Bermuda and the Bahamas, were separated from the other Bahamas in 1848, and formed into a distinct Presidency, under the government-in-chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is salubrious and very pleasant in the winter season, and the Colony has in recent years been much frequented by visitors from the United States and Canada, there being excellent hotels and other accommodation for tourists. The average annual rainfall for the past 3 years was 44'33 inches, the rainy season extending from June to October. The mean minimum temperature is 71'6 degrees, the extreme range being from 92 to 54 during the years 1913 to 1918 (6 years). The last severe hurricane experienced was in September and October, 1908, causing loss of life, and much damage and distress in some of the Out Islands. Another hurricane occurred in September, 1919, causing the loss of 25 lives and damage to property.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race. About one-sixth are of European descent. English is universally spoken.

Trade and Industry.

The commercial relations of the Colony are mainly with the United States. Considerable quantities of pine-apples (canned), sponges, sisal and tomatoes are exported. In 1918 the principal exports were as follows:—sisal, 5,839,201 lbs., value 128,564l.; sponges, 619,499 lbs., value 107,622l.; pineapples, 7,454l.; tomatoes, 12,954l.

Cotton, the cultivation of which was introduced by Royalist refugees from the United States, was grown in large quantities prior to the abolition of slavery, and also during the American War, but has practically ceased to be grown.

The cultivation and preparation of the sisal fibre plant is an important industry. The estimated area planted at the end of 1918 is over 28,000 acres.

The sugar-cane grows luxuriantly in many of the islands, but is little cultivated.

The Colony enjoyed great prosperity during the American Civil War, when it was the headquarters of many blockade running operations.

Fishing is extensively carried on for the Nassau market, over 100 native-built boats, with 500 men, being employed. Turtle-shell, shells and pearls are largely exported. Sponge-fishing employs a large fleet. The approximate number of vessels engaged in the industry in 1918 was 517—aggregate tonnage 5,177—with 2,509 open boats, and a large number of long shore open boats; men and boys employed 5,000; and 334 men and women in clipping, sorting and packing for export. Nassau is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1918, 263 ships registered, of 6,997 tons.

Salt-raking, one of the earliest industries, has fallen off, the export of salt in 1918 being only 1,770l., as compared with 2,470l. in 1890. There is little market in America for Bahamas salt, but it is hoped it may be revived. Some of the islets yield guano. The chief imports are: foodstuffs, 188,953l.; spirits and wines, 7,676l.; tobacco, cigars and cigarettes, 11,698l.; raw material, 10,389l.; manufactured articles, 148,345l.

Lighthouses on several of the islands have been established, and are maintained by the Imperial Government at a cost of 10,000l. per annum, exclusive of stores supplied from England. Several lights are also maintained by the local government.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and United States current coin*. Accounts are

* On proclamation.
kept in sterling. There is no Colonial currency. There is a branch bank of the Royal Bank of Canada with deposits amounting to £332,591,717. A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had, on 30th June, 1918, 27,396l. deposited.

Means of Communication.

There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony, and but few good roads except in New Providence. There are at present no contract mail services, but communication with New York and Cuba are being kept up as far as war conditions permit, by the New York and Cuba Mail S.S. Co. ("Ward Line"), and there are frequent motor boats between Nassau and Florida. Till February, 1892, the nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe was Key West, but in that month a cable from Nassau to Florida was completed. The cable is not however at present in working order. A wireless station has been installed at Nassau. The rates of postage are:

- **Letters.**
  - Internal: 1d. per 2 oz.
  - U.K., and the Empire: 1d. per oz.
  - U.S. America: 2d. per 2 oz.
  - Other Foreign Postal Union Countries: 2½d. per oz. & ¼d. per each successive unit.

- **Newspapers.**
  - Internal: Free.
  - U.K., and the Empire: ½d. per oz.
  - U.S. America: 1d. per oz.
  - Other Foreign Postal Union Countries: 1½d. per oz. & ¼d. per each successive unit.

A parcels post with the United Kingdom (1s., 2s. and 3s.) and the United States (6d. a lb.) has been established, also money order agreements with the United States and Canada.

A war tax stamp of 1d. is chargeable on letters to and from places within the Empire, and 1s. on parcels to and from places within the Empire and the United States, America.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is conducted, under Letters Patent, by the Governor, aided by an Executive Council not exceeding 9 members. The Legislative authority resides in the Governor, a Legislative Council, nominated by the Crown, and a Representative Assembly of 29 members, elected for 15 districts by persons owning land of the value of 5l., or occupying houses of the rental value of 2l. 8s. in New Providence, or half that amount in the Out Islands. The qualifications of electors are full age, a residence of 12 months, with land value 5l.; or being a house-holder of premises value 2l. 8s. in New Providence, or 1l. 4s. elsewhere, for six months. The qualification of Members is possession of an estate of real or personal property of the value of 200l. The Executive Council is composed partly of official and partly of unofficial Members who have a seat in one of the branches of the Legislature. In the absence of the Governor the Senior Member of the Executive Council (nominally the Colonial Secretary, *ex officio*) administers the Government.

Education.

There is a Government system of elementary education, established 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, 1885, and Consolidating Act of 1908. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local Committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.

There are 50 unsectarian Government schools, with 5,975 scholars; 12 aided schools, with 733 scholars; 26 Church of England and 14 private schools, with 1,238 Church of England and 184 Private scholars; 4 Roman Catholic schools, with 407 scholars. The Government schools were made free in 1885. The compulsory clauses of the law are enforced only in Nassau and the larger villages. Higher education is provided at the Nassau Grammar School, the Queen's College, and St. Hilda's School, all in Nassau.
