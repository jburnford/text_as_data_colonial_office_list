CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane (Tāmraparnū, the Island of "dusky faces"), is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustán, lying between 5°55' and 9°50' N. lat. and 79°42' and 81°53' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 271 miles; its greatest width 139 miles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangemankande on the east. Its area is 26,481 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldive Archipelago, 400 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which are sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is estimated at 72,237; the people are traders and seamen. Malé, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate of Ceylon for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustán. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 81° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° Fahr. At Colombo the average monthly temperature varies from a mean minimum of 71° Fahr. in January and February to a mean maximum of 90° Fahr. in March and April; at Galle 74° Fahr. in January to 86° Fahr. in March and April; at Trincomalee 74° Fahr. in December and January to 94° Fahr. in May. The highest temperatures are experienced in the district to the north of the hills, and to the north-east, but it is only in a very few days in the year that a temperature of 100° Fahr. or over is experienced. Trincomalee holds the record with 103°7 Fahr. In the hills there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, during the months of January, February and March occasionally recording frost.

The annual average rainfall varies from 40-50 inches in the dry zones to the north-west and south-east of the Island to above 200 inches at certain places on the south-west slopes of the hills. The rainy season extends from April to June and from October to December, but there is hardly a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.

History.

The authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity, exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in
interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

In the sixteenth century the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

**Constitution.**

In 1798 the first separate British Governor arrived. He governed without a Council, until the appointment of a "King's Council" in 1801. This gave place in 1833 to the two Councils now existing.

By Letters Patent and Instructions issued at the end of 1910, and by an Ordinance passed in the same year in Ceylon, the present constitution was settled.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of seven members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Controller of Revenue, the Treasurer, the Government Agent for the Western Province and one other office holder; and a Legislative Council of 21 members, including the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, four other office holders, and six nominated and four elected unofficial members. Of the elected members two represent the Europeans, one elected by the urban residents and one by residents in the country districts and small towns. One member is elected by the educated Ceylonese, other than Burghers or Europeans, and one by the Burgher class. Of the unofficial members nominated by the Governor, two represent the low-country Sinhalese, two the Tamils, one the Kandyans, and one the Mohammedan community.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

According to the decennial census, taken on the 10th March, 1911, the population was 4,110,367, an increase of 14.9 per cent. on the population enumerated in 1901. The details of the population were as follows (including the military, shipping and estates):

| Province                        | Population |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Western Province                | 1,103,886  |
| Central ditto                   | 672,560    |
| Northern ditto                  | 370,016    |
| Southern ditto                  | 629,183    |
| Eastern ditto                   | 183,996    |
| North-Western Province          | 434,271    |
| North-Central ditto             | 86,276     |
| Province of Uva                 | 216,858    |
| Province of Sabaragamuwa        | 408,521    |
| **Total**                       | **4,110,367** |

Among these were 8,524 Europeans, 26,673 Burghers and Eurasians, 2,715,636 Sinhalese, 1,060,167 Tamils, 267,064 Moors, 12,992 Malays, and 19,271 persons of other nationalities. The Buddhists (2,474,393) numbered more than half the population, there were 939,701 Hindûs, 410,525 Christians (mostly Roman Catholic), 284,482 Mohammedans, and 1,266 other religions.

The population of the principal towns was as follows:

- Colombo, 213,396
- Negombo, 13,152
- Moratuwa, 27,263
- Kalutara, 13,006
- Kandy, 30,148
- Jaffna, 40,539
- Galle, 40,187
- Matara, 13,851
- Batticaloa, 10,715
- Trincomalee, 9,086
- Kurunegala, 8,163
- Badulla, 6,488

The number of Indian coolies on the tea estates, etc., is about 440,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 510,000.

The entire area of the Colony is 25,481 square miles. About one quarter of this area, after deducting backwaters, etc., is under cultivation. Some 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The most important products are:

| Product       | Acres   |
|---------------|---------|
| Coconuts      | 925,921 |
| Rice          | 678,814 |
| Tea           | 505,689 |
| Grain (other than Rice) | 146,572 |
| Rubber        | 281,491 |
| Cinnamon      | 37,969  |
| Cocoa         | 30,851  |
| Tobacco       | 13,672  |
| Coffee        | 810     |

During 1918, the number of plumbago mines reported to have worked was 842. The amount of plumbago exported during the year was 304,240 cwt.

The minimum upset price of Crown land is rs. 15 per acre. 11,112 acres were sold in 1918 at an average price of rs. 28 per acre.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs Duties, Land Sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack and Toddy Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt for the financial year 1917-18 was rs. 1,130,961-38. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed on an import duty of rs. 3 per cwt.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Minuwangoda, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Nawalapitiya, Hatton Dickoya, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradapura, Badulla, Bandarawela, Ratnapura, Kegalla, Moratuwa, and Jaffna and by Gansabawas amounted in 1917 to rs. 6,984,716-46.

The municipal debt on 31st Dec., 1918, was rs. 14,520,645-31. Of this amount rs. 11,072,980 were borrowed from the Government for the Colombo Drainage Works, and rs. 3,000,000 for Water Works. Rs. 34,392-08 is the balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle for the construction of waterworks, and rs. 170,583 is the balance due from the municipality of Kandy for waterworks and drainage.

The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export,
There has been a remarkable development in rubber cultivation in recent years. Rubber was first brought to Ceylon in 1876, and its growth proved successful. On the failure of coffee planters preferred to substitute cinchona and tea. Cinchona however did not survive low prices and was replaced by tea. Within recent years great attention has been given to rubber. In 1898 750 acres were estimated to be planted with rubber, in 1901 there were 2,500 acres, in 1904 11,000 acres, in 1905 40,000 acres, in 1906 100,000 acres, in 1908, 180,000 acres, in 1911 about 215,000 acres, and in 1917 about 294,160 acres under this product.

The value of the products of the coconut palm exported in 1918 was rs. 35,688,709. During the past few years greater attention has been given to the cultivation of coconuts, and large areas of land formerly occupied with cinnamon are now planted in this crop. The value of cacao exported in 1918 was rs. 2,352,160 and of cinnamon, rs. 1,349,605. Of the total Ceylon produce exported that portion going to the United Kingdom was valued at rs. 88,380,893, that to British possessions valued at rs. 62,946,198, and that to foreign countries at rs. 46,306,103.

The chief imports are rice from India, valued at rs. 52,521,441 in 1918, coal from India and textiles from the United Kingdom.

**Law and Justice.**

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. Kandyan law and Mohammedan law also prevail among Kandyans and Mohammedans respectively. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of minor criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the Police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases. In addition to these there are the Ganabawas, Village Councils, and Village Tribunals, instituted under the Ordinance No. 24 of 1889, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked well and are thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people. Besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, they have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

**Education.**

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1918 was 125,779, in schools aided by Government 255,083, and in unaided schools 31,787.

The total expenditure on account of the Education Department was rs. 2,689,131-23. In 1868, the number of scholars was only 6,897, and the expenditure rs. 161,660. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Education and the adoption of a system under which the educational wants of the Island are met partly by Government, partly by schools receiving grants in aid from Government. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education; small fees are charged for English teaching.

The only High School entirely supported by Government is the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-aid High Schools. Two Government scholarships, each of £250 per annum for three years (extended in certain special cases to four years), to be spent at English universities, are awarded annually.

A technical education is provided at the Grant-in-aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are 39. A central Technical College was founded in Colombo in 1893; its title has since been changed to "Government Technical Schools."

A Government Training College for Masters' and Mistresses in English Schools and Government Vernacular Schools was opened in 1903.

**Medical Institutions.**

**Medical College.**—The Ceylon Medical College was founded in 1870 to provide a course of Medical training for the natives of Ceylon. The curriculum is a full five years' course, and since 1887 the Licence of the College has been recognised by the General Medical Council as a registrable Colonial qualification. The courses of instruction and examinations are also recognised by many of the British Examining Boards. The licence has been conferred upon 327 candidates since the College was opened; of recent years about 18 qualify annually.

There is a Junior or Apothecary Department in which students go through a two years' course, and after passing the prescribed examinations are qualified to serve as Apothecaries.

The College has a staff of over 20 lecturers and is managed by a Council incorporated by law, which is also the Medical Registration Authority for the Colony.

There are at present about 275 students.

The Government maintains 84 hospitals, exclusive of 22 infectious hospitals, 17 jail hospitals, and two asylums, one for lunatics of 514 beds, and the other for lepers of 406 beds. There are special institutions for diseases of women and children, and for the eye, ear and throat. There is a Bacteriological and also a Pasteur Institute. There are 450 dispensaries, 78 of which are attached to hospitals, the remaining 372 are institutions independent of hospitals. In addition there are 432 private estate dispensaries and 50 estate hospitals which receive free drugs from the Government.

The Ceylon Civil Medical Department consists of one Principal Civil Medical Officer and Inspector-General of Hospitals who is also Principal of the
Medical College, one Assistant Principal Civil Medical Officer and Inspector-General of Hospitals, two Itinerating Inspecting Medical Officers, one Accountant, one Director De Soysa Bacteriological Institute and Pasteur Institute, one Medical Superintendent, General Hospital, Colombo, one Medical Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum, one Medical Superintendent, Lepre Asylum, one Superintendent, Civil Medical Stores, one Bacteriologist, and one Assistant Bacteriologist, nine Provincial Surgeons, 73 officer having British qualifications, 2 with a Calcutta degrees 15 with Madras degrees, 2 medical women with British qualifications, 85 with licences in medicine and surgery granted by the Ceylon Medical College, of whom one is a medical woman, 314 apothecaries, 9 inspectors of vaccination, and 139 vaccinators, including 7 females. There are two institutions where nurses are trained, and the nursing staff consists of 29 European qualified matrons and sisters, 55 European Roman Catholic sisters, 54 matrons and 99 nurses trained locally, and 42 pupils in training.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1917-18 to rs. 4,041,890-21. The expenditure on account of estate medicalaid was rs. 952,840-24. The receipts, which included cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, etc., amounted to rs. 327,587-85. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estates Branch of the Department yielded rs. 640,647-16.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is Indian and Ceylon rupee currency and sovereigns, gold having been made a legal tender in 1801 at the fixed rate of rs. 15 per sovereign. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and piee. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue of which the amount in circulation on the 30th September, 1918, was rs. 37,340,522. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885. The deposits in these two banks amounted, on 31st Dec., 1918, to rs. 6,306,181.

The Colombo Harbour.

A body designated the Colombo Port Commission was established on the 1st July, 1913, to administer the affairs of the Port of Colombo. The Commission is responsible for the efficient working of the Port, and has powers of executive action and initiative. It is composed of six official members, six unofficial members, and a secretary. The official members are the Principal Collector of Customs (Chairman), the Principal Civil Medical Officer, the General Manager of the Railway, the Deputy Collector of Customs, the Master Attendant, and the Harbour Engineer. Five of the unofficial members are nominated by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, and the sixth (representative of the native interests of the Port) by the Governor.

The Harbour Works consist of three breakwaters. The South-West, commenced in 1873, and completed in 1885, at a cost of 705,207l., is 4,212 feet long, and runs from the shore in a direction North by East. It is built of concrete blocks weighing from 18 to 30 tons, set in what is known as the sloping bond system.

The North-East and North-West breakwaters were commenced in 1894, and completed in 1906, at a total cost of 500,000l. The North-East breakwater is a rubble embankment 1,100 feet long, tipped from a staging.

The North-West breakwater is an island work, 2,657 feet in length, running between the two shore breakwaters, leaving a southern entrance of 800 feet, and a northern entrance of 700 feet. This breakwater is of similar construction to the South-West arm.

These three breakwaters enclose an area of 640 acres, or one square mile.

The Graving Dock. In addition to the above-named works a Graving Dock was commenced in 1899, and is now in use. It is 700 feet long, 85 feet wide at the entrance, and has a depth over the sill of 30 feet at low water. Its cost was about 400,000l. There is also a guide pier, 800 feet long, to assist vessels entering the dock.

The Patent Slip was commenced in 1899, and opened on the 1st January, 1903, the cost being 43,000l. It is 800 feet long, the cradle being 220 feet wide at the entrance, and is capable of dealing with vessels up to 1,200 tons dead weight.

The Coaling Depot consists of 24 acres of land, reclaimed from the sea, with a frontage of 2,200 feet, from which 18 jetties project into the harbour for the landing, stacking, and shipping of coal.

The total cost of the Reclamation and Jetties amounts to about 163,000l.

The Fishery Harbour has been constructed to the northward of Colombo harbour for the use of the fishermen as a beaching ground, the whole of the foreshore inside Colombo harbour having been covered up by reclamation work. The fishery harbour consists of a rubble breakwater running out from the shore in a curve for 800 feet, the sheltered part forming a natural beaching ground for fishing canoes. The cost was approximately 12,000l.

The total expenditure on the Colombo harbour from 1873, when the first breakwater was commenced, to 30th June, 1913, when the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the harbour, was rs. 44,790,267-39, or 2,986,018l., taking the value of the rupee at 1s. 4d.

An extension of the S.W. breakwater, starting from a point 3,150 feet from the shore end, was commenced in December, 1907, and completed in April, 1912. The arm is 1,800 feet long, and runs in a direction almost due north, protecting the present main entrance from the S.W. Monsoon seas. The cost of this additional arm was 380,000l.

In the period 1st July, 1913, to 30th September, 1918, a sum of rs. 6,988,219-74 or 465,881l., has been spent on various development and maintenance works by the Harbour Engineer's
Department of the Colombo Port Commission, and a sum of rs. 1,866,756-31 or 123,784l., by the Public Works Department, making a total of rs. 8,844,976-06 or 589,665l.

During the past six years since the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the Port, many improvements have been carried out, and the facilities on shore have much increased; the warehouse accommodation which in 1913 was 291,600 sq. ft. is now 559,106 sq. ft. and the quayage has been increased from 4,645 lineal ft. to 5,828 lineal ft. in the corresponding period.

The Colombo Port Commission is constructing a depot at Kolonnawa (about 3 miles from the Colombo Harbour) for oil installations at Colombo, the work being in charge of the Harbour Engineer. The work was commenced in December 1917, and the expenditure from that date to 30th September, 1918, amounts to rs. 510,122-49.

Colombo Water Supply.

The Colombo Water supply is obtained from Labugama Reservoir which is situated at a distance of 28½ miles from the City.

The Reservoir was formed by impounding the waters of the Wak-Oya, a tributary of the Kelani Ganga.

The Catchment area which is 2,385 acres in extent, is free from habitation or cultivation.

The Reservoir has a capacity of 1,235 million gallons to the lowest draw-off sluice.

The average rainfall for the past 30 years is 160 inches, the maximum being 210-91 and the minimum 127-56 inches.

Filtration works of the Jewel Gravity Type are situated immediately below the Reservoir embankment.

The water is conveyed to the two service Reservoirs situated within the limits of the City by a duplicate 20-inch diameter pipe line and one of 30-inch diameter.

There are some 225 miles of distribution mains and water service is available to all premises in the City.

The average daily consumption is estimated at 6½ million gallons, and the consumption per head per day equals 25 gallons.

Railways

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus:—Broad Gauge (5ft. 6in.), Colombo to Ella (169¾ miles), Polgahawela to Kankesanturia (212½ miles), Peradeniya Junction to Kandy and Matale (21¼ miles), Ragama Junction to Mahara Quarry (12 miles), Colombo to Matare (98½ miles), Ragama to Chilaw (41½ miles), Fort Junction to Wharf (1½ miles), Madawachi to North and South Pier, Talaimannar (66 miles). Narrow Gauge (2ft. 6in.), Colombo to Yatiyantota (48½ miles), Arissawella to Dela (33½ miles), Nanu Oya to Ragulla (19½ miles). Total mileage 712 miles.

The total cost of construction up to 30th Sept., 1917, charged in account was rs. 140,184,015. The receipts for the 12 months ended 30th Sept., 1918, were rs. 18,159,753, and expenditure rs. 9,099,413.

The following new lines are under construction viz.:—

Broad Gauge, Ella to Badulla, 13 miles.
Narrow ,, Dela to Opanaike, 16 miles.

By the completion of the Talaimannar extension the railway systems of India and Ceylon were brought within 20 miles of one another, the intervening distance being covered by steamers of the South Indian Railway Co., which ply between Dhanuskodi (the Indian Port) and Talaimannar (the Ceylon Port). The other extensions are for the better transport of planting produce (tea, rubber, coconuts, etc.).

Roads.

Of metalled roads there are 3,302 miles; gravelled and natural roads, 445 and 266 miles respectively; of canals 153-12 miles. The maintenance of 4,073 miles of road cost, in 1918, rs. 3,207,682, or an average rate of rs. 808 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees collect the commutation, but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new waterworks.

Telephones.

The Government telephone system comprises an exchange at Colombo (1,663 subscribers), in trunk communication with exchanges at Kandy (114 subscribers), Nuwara Eliya (104 subscribers), Galle (72 subscribers), and smaller exchanges at Hatton, Gamoola, Kalutara, Kelaniya, Kotte, Kurunegala, Nawalapitiya, Negombo, Matale, Peradeniya, Polgahawela, Moratuwa and Ragama; and also purely local exchanges at Anuradhapura, Bandarawela, Diyalawas, and Matale. There are, in addition, 68 licensed private systems of various sizes, several of which are connected by means of junction lines and subsidiary trunks with one another and the main trunk lines. The mileage of telephone wire in the Government system is estimated at 1,487 (aerial) and 7,636 (underground).

Telegraphs.

Nearly all parts of the island are served by the Government telegraph system, which has 263 offices working. The system comprises 2,101 miles of line and 7,133 miles of wire. Ceylon is in direct telegraphic communication with India by a cable which starts from Talaimannar and crosses the Pamban Channel. It is also connected with Europe by a direct cable from Colombo to Aden and with the Far East and Australia by a direct cable to Penang.

There is a Government wireless telegraph station at Colombo having a normal daylight range of about 400 miles, open to traffic of all kinds.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom and Ceylon, Straits and China, and Australia.
2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles and Ceylon Straits and China, and a monthly service between Ceylon and Australia by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes.
3. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, by steamers of the Orient Line. The passage to Brindisi or

Note.—The above are normal services which are considerably restricted and varied by War conditions.
Marseilles generally occupies from 14 to 16 days, and to Penang, Singapore, and China 4, 5, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, carried on by the British India Steam Navigation Company. There is a daily service by rail between Ceylon and India.

Letters, etc., from England reach Colombo in about 16 days (14 minimum, 17½ maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the N.Y.K. Line with Aden and the Straits and China, while the Natal Direct Line and the Indian and African Line maintain a service between Ceylon and South African Ports. There is also an irregular service between Ceylon and the Maldivian Islands by buggalows.
