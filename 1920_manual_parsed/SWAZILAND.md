SWAZILAND.

Situation and Area.

Swaziland is bounded on the North, West, and South by the Transvaal, and on the East by Portuguese territory and Tongaland, now part of the Natal Province.

Its area is 6,678 square miles.

Description and Climate.

The territory is divided geographically into three longitudinal regions.

The mountainous region on the West approximates an altitude of over 4,000 feet.

What is known as the Middle Veld is some 2,000 feet lower, while the Low Veld, bounded on the East by the Lebombo Mountains, attains an average altitude of not more than 1,000 feet.

The first two regions are remarkably well watered. Innumerable small streams unite with the large rivers which traverse the country from West to East; except for these the Low Veld is not very well watered, though bore holes put down recently by private enterprise have revealed the existence of underground supplies of water at several places.

Swaziland is on the whole, very healthy, but in common with other parts of similar country in South Africa, malaria is prevalent in the Low Veld during some of the summer months.

Mbabane, the headquarters of the Administration, is situated on the hills at an altitude of 4,000 feet, and Bremersdorp, the old capital, is on the Middle Veld. Other European centres are the Government Stations at Hlatikulu, Mankaiana, Stegi and Pigg's Peak.

Native History.

The Swazis are an allied race to the Zulus and speak the same language, with minor modifications. According to themselves the tribe lived originally in Southern Tongaland, from whence they migrated about 300 years ago to the Tshilweni country, that is the country to the West of the Umhlabeni River, between the Pongolo and the Great Usutu Rivers. Here they remained until 1815 when being attacked by Zwide, Chief of the Ndwande, the major portion of the tribe under their chief Sobhuza, better known as Somhlolo, fled north and settled near the present site of Bremersdorp. The patty tribes or clans of Barcswi, Bavenda or Bapoli origin then in occupation of Swaziland North of the Great Usutu, were conquered and absorbed. Under Sobhuza and his successor Mswazi, they occupied territory up to Barberton in the North and extending towards Carolina and Ermelo on the West, while the tribes occupying what is now the Lydenburg District also paid tribute to the Swazi King.

The Swazis are known to themselves and other native tribes as the Ama-Ngwanwe, that is, the people of Ngwane, one of their early Chiefs, and the country as Kwa-Ngwanwe, the land of Ngwane. After their flight to the North they were never seriously disturbed, though they were occasionally raided by Zulu tribes from the South, especially after the death of Dingana, who was killed by a Swazi Impi on the Southern border, after his defeat by the Boers and his brother Mpande. Subsequently through the good offices of Sir Theophilus Shepstone (Somtseu) amicable relations subsisted with Mpande, the Zulu King and his successor Cetywayo. In 1879 the Swazis lent assistance to the British in the war against Sekukuni, but took no part in the Zulu War.

Through the possession of secret medicines, used in the propitiation of the spirits of ancestral Chiefs, the Swazi Chiefs hold a pre-eminent position as rain makers. The native Government consisted of the King and his Council, made up of the Malangeni, the Chiefs of royal blood, and the Chief indunas of the tribe. The assistance of the witchdoctors was called in whenever necessary, to communicate with the spirits of departed Chiefs and to clean the country of sorcerers and other doers of evil. A military system of trained regiments on the lines formulated by Dingiswayo and Tshaka was adopted, mainly no doubt as a defence against the Zulus.

In the year 1846 Mswazi ceded whatever rights he had in the Lydenburg District to the Lydenburg Republic. Subsequently he, and later, Mbandini, entered into agreements purporting to cede the whole of the territory to that Republic and to its successor the late South African Republic. These later cessions were in fact nullified by the Conventions of 1881 and 1884 entered into between Great Britain and the Republic though the boundaries of the Transvaal laid down in the 1881 Convention constituted a considerable encroachment on what was claimed to be Swazi Territory.

Sobhuza the son of Bhunu, is now heir apparent. He has not yet been installed as Paramount Chief and during his minority his grandmother Labotsibeni has acted as Queen Regent of the nation. She is officially styled the Chief Regent and by her own people is given the title of "Ndhlovukazi" or the Cow Elephant. She is assisted by Lomvanzi her son, who was nominated by the Council to act as Regent during the minority of the heir, and by other leading chiefs who have in the past acted in a similar capacity, during the minority of preceding chiefs.

European Settlement.

During the eighties the King "Mbandini" in return for money and other payments granted concessions for various periods. Every conceivable right was granted away, not only for land, minerals, grazing, and timber, but also for all imaginable purposes, including exemption from taxes, for railways, telegraphs, mining patents, collection of the King's revenue, trading, etc. All unallotted land and minerals also formed the subject of concessions.

In 1888 a charter of self-government was granted to the whites in the country. Later, in 1890, under a Convention between the British Government and the South African Republic, a provisional Government was, with the consent of the Swazis, set up, consisting of a Government Committee composed of representatives of those two Powers, and a representative of the Swazis, a Government Secretary, Attorney General and other officials and of a Chief Court. This Court adjudicated on the initial validity of all concessions granted by the King, and, with a few exceptions, confirmed the grants in respect of such initial validity.

In accordance with pledges given to the Government of the South African Republic the provisional Administration came to an end three years later, when the British Government signed a fresh Convention, which permitted the South African Republic to acquire from the Regent and her Council an Organic Proclamation conferring on the South African Republic rights of jurisdiction, legislation and administration without incorporation in the South African Republic. The Swazis
refused to sign the Organic Proclamation which had been drafted for them, and accordingly its provisions, with some of those in the 1893 Convention, were embodied in the final Convention of 1894, under which the South African Republic exercised powers of protection, legislation, jurisdiction and administration in Swaziland, subject to the limitations of the Convention.

On the conquest of the Transvaal, all the rights and powers of the late South African Republic passed to His Majesty, but since the other party to the Convention of 1894 had disappeared without the limitations therein, an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act was issued in June, 1903, providing that the Governor of the Transvaal should administer Swaziland, and conferring on him the right to legislate by Proclamation.

On the cessation of hostilities a British Special Commissioner, with a small force of South African Constabulary, was sent into the country, and a provisional Administration was established.

In accordance with the powers granted to him, the Governor issued a Proclamation in 1904 providing for administration and for dealing with the concessions question. The Laws of the Transvaal were re-enacted, mutatis mutandis, and except where modified by Statute, the Roman-Dutch Common Law was put in force by the Proclamation. A special Court, having the full jurisdiction of a Superior Court, was established together with Courts of Assistant Commissioners with a limited jurisdiction.

The paramount chief and other chiefs were confirmed in their Civil Jurisdiction over natives subject to appeal to the Resident Commissioner. Provision was made for the Swaziland Deeds Office and Surveyor-General's Office to remain at Pretoria under control of the officers responsible prior to the date of the Proclamation.

Population.

The population of Swaziland, according to the census of 1911, was 1,083 whites and 98,876 coloured.

Religion and Education.

The Anglican Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the South Africa General Mission, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission, the African Methodist Episcopal Mission, the Wesleyan Methodist Mission, the Independent Methodist Mission, the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene, and the American International Holiness Union have representatives in the country.

The Administration has established a native school at Zombode, the kraal of the Regent, at which, until recently, the young paramount chief was educated. The Government also maintains nine schools for European children at various centres, and makes annual grants to the various native missions which undertake native education.

Industries, Agriculture & Trade.

Mining in Swaziland is carried out under the authority of Concessions granted by the late King Mbandeni. Tin is found in payable quantities in the vicinity of Mbabane. Gold Mining was carried on for some years at the Pigg's Peak and other mines, but, owing to the increased cost of this class of mining all work has ceased for the present. The Crown owns a few mineral areas, and legal provision has been made for the exploitation of these by the public in the event of payable minerals being discovered. The following table shows the output of tin and gold for the last four years.

| Year | Tin Output | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1915-16 | 584 tons | £56,067 |
| 1916-17 | 459 " | 46,732 |
| 1917-18 | 462 " | 93,150 |
| 1918-19 | 480 " | 76,870 |

| Year | Gold Output | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1915-16 | 6,497 ounces | £29,585 |
| 1916-17 | 4,633 " | 19,682 |
| 1917-18 | Nil. | Nil. |
| 1918-19 | " | " |
There are approximately 160,000 head of horned stock, and 250,000 native sheep and goats in the territory. Cattle ranching on a large scale has been in operation for some years. The Natalian Ranch has about 10,000 head of cattle and approximately 100 imported pure bred and 70 grade bulls and has under cultivation about 500 acres of mealies. Ranches Limited have about 5,000 head of cattle, 50 imported pure bred and 50 grade bulls.

The Coal Mines Ranch has about 5,000 head of cattle. Several other farmers have herds of cattle ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 head. The young stock from the imported bulls on the Ranches show a very marked improvement on the local cattle.

The stock is fat all the year round and fat oxen can be put on the market in the winter and spring without any artificial feeding.

Dipping of all cattle is consistently carried out and diseases of stock are not more virulent here than elsewhere in South Africa. The East Coast fever disease has now almost been eradicated.

Approximately 300,000 sheep (Merinos) are brought in from the Transvaal high veldt for winter grazing but this class of sheep has not so far been farmed in the Territory otherwise.

From an agricultural point of view farming is assuming some importance owing mainly to the grant on easy terms of allotments of Crown Land to European settlers.

Maize is the staple product but cotton is likely to be grown extensively in the future in suitable localities. Tobacco is also a paying crop and many portions of the Territory have been favourably reported on for citrus and sub-tropical fruits. At present, in the absence of a railway, no sufficient market exists for products of this nature. The Swazis grow the usual native crops but in insufficient quantity to feed themselves. Efforts are however being made to improve their methods.

No statistics of the imports into and the exports from Swaziland are now kept. By an agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Swaziland is dealt with, for Customs purposes, as a part of the Union. Payments due to Swaziland are assessed on the proportions which the average of the collections for the three years ended March 31st, 1910, bear to the total customs collections of the Union in each year. The imports consist principally of maize, flour, groceries, wearing apparel, hardware, spirits, tobacco, and kaffir truck; while the principal export in Cassiterite tin.

There are branches of the National Bank of South Africa, Limited, at Mbabane, and Hlatikulu, as also a Post Office Savings Bank at Mbabane. The currency is British.

Stores exist where necessary to serve the needs of the population, but the volume of trade is small.

The War.

The Swazis sent a small number of men to France with the Labour Battalion. They also collected and transmitted to the King as a War gift the sum of £3,000 for which two Aeroplanes, suitably inscribed were purchased by direction of His Majesty. Their attitude during the war has been loyal.

Amongst the Europeans practically every eligible man of British birth able to get away has done service. Casualties fortunately were few in proportion to the number at the front. War Funds were also well supported, and in addition a troop for service in South West Africa was horsed by public subscription.

Revenue and Expenditure.

The revenue and expenditure for the two years ended March 31st, 1919, was:

| Year     | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1917-18  | £70,796   | £70,065     |
| 1918-19  | £72,447   | £81,197     |

The public debt on March 31st, 1918, was £2,500, for the repayment of which provision has been made through the medium of a sinking fund.

RHODESIA.*

Rhodesia (so called after the late Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes) is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in its Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese Dominions." Of these extensive territories the Company is now responsible for the administration of the following portions:

1. Southern Rhodesia, or the provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland (area 149,000 square miles).
2. Northern Rhodesia, or the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the Nyasaland Protectorate. The area is estimated at about 291,000 square miles.

* The information in this notice is kindly supplied by the British South Africa Company.

I.—SOUTHERN RHODESIA.

The limits of Southern Rhodesia, as defined by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 20th October, 1898, are the parts of South Africa bounded by the Portuguese Possessions, by the Transvaal Colony to a point opposite the mouth of the River Shashi, by the River Shashi to its junction with the Tati and Ramaquaban rivers, thence by the Ramaquaban river to its source, thence by the watershed to the Rivers Shashi and Ramaquaban until such watershed strikes the Hunter's Road (called the Pandamatenka Road), thence by that road to the River Zambesi, and by that river to the Portuguese boundary. The said limits include an area of ten miles' radius round Fort Tuli, but exclude the area of the district known as the Tati district as defined by the Charter.

II.—NORTHERN RHODESIA.

This territory was previously divided into two provinces:

(a.) Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.
(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.
The rinderpest, which for several years had been devastating Africa, travelling slowly through shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1899, a
Africa Company.

(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.
By the order in Council, dated 4th May, 1911, these two provinces were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. The amalgamation took effect from 17th August, 1911. The limits of the territory as defined by the order in Council are "the parts of Africa bounded by Southern Rhodesia, German South-West Africa, Portuguese West Africa, the Congo Free State, German East Africa, Nyasaland and Portuguese-East Africa."

History.

On the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lobengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Macloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was duly reached, and Fort Salisbury, 12 miles South-east of Mount Hampden, having been founded (12th September, 1890) the pioneers were disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims and farms.

In July, 1893, the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives living under the Company's protection, near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland, to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's police and a small force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's forces near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lobengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Shangani, and Major Wilson and a small party of men were, after a heroic resistance, killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from small-pox or fever.

In 1896, owing to a variety of causes, the Matabele broke out in rebellion, and shortly after the Mashonas followed suit. After a prolonged struggle the rebellion was subdued in September, 1897.

The rinderpest, which for several years had been devastating Africa, travelling slowly through the continent from north to south, made its first appearance in Matabeleland in February, 1896. The adoption of the drastic regulations which the administration decided to enforce had to some extent checked the progress of the epidemic, when the outbreak of the rebellion put a stop to all precautionary measures.

In March, 1898, a system of compulsory inoculation for rinderpest was established, and the precautions taken completely stamped out the disease.

From 1897 to 1899 the development of the country advanced rapidly, but the outbreak of the war with the Republics, in October, 1899, practically put a stop to progressive work of every kind, and for months the territory was completely cut off from the south.

On the outbreak of hostilities Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir Robert) Baden-Powell was in supreme command of all the forces in Southern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. When Mafeking was invested the command of the Rhodesian forces devolved upon Colonel (now Field Marshal Lord) Plumer, who was stationed at Tuli with a force of 450 men. In November, 1899, Martial Law was proclaimed in certain districts in Matabeleland, and, at a later date, in the whole territory, and the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers to the number of 800, were called out for active service.

At the beginning of January, 1900, Colonel Plumer moved his column to Palachwe and assumed direct command of the troops in the Protectorate, amongst whom were included 600 Volunteers and over 400 men of the British South Africa Police. Mafeking was successfully relieved by Mahon and Plumer's united columns on the 17th May.

In the early part of 1900 a force of 5,000 men, consisting of Australian, New Zealand and Canadian Volunteers and English Yeomanry, was despatched to Rhodesia, via Beira, under the command of General Sir Frederick Carrington. This force was sent to the front as speedily as possible, two companies of Militia Infantry being retained at Bulawayo as a garrison.

The Administration of Southern Rhodesia estimated that the number of men contributed by Rhodesia was approximately 1,500, being at least 12½ per cent. of the European population. Despatches which have been published bear testimony to the good work performed by the Volunteers, Police, and the Rhodesia Regiment, and they also gained the special approbation of the late Commander-in-Chief.

The attitude of the natives throughout the war was most satisfactory, and, although in some districts there appeared signs of unrest, it was confined to attempts by discontented natives to work up the feelings of the people, who were, however, not affected by them to any appreciable degree.

Martial Law in Southern Rhodesia was withdrawn on the 26th July, 1902.

Constitution.

In 1888 that portion of Rhodesia now known as Southern Rhodesia was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1899, a
resolution was passed agreeing to accept the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government to be made in the original Charter of the Company by a Supplemental Charter, and a further resolution was passed approving certain alterations in the original Deed of Settlement of the Company. These resolutions were confirmed at a further Extraordinary General Meeting, held on the 10th of January, 1900.

The Constitution of Southern Rhodesia, originally laid down by the Charter, was subsequently amended by the Orders in Council of the 9th May, 1891; 30th July, 1891; and 18th July, 1894, the latter being known as the "Matabeleland Order in Council." This Order was revoked by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1898, which provides for the Administration of the Territory, Legislation, the Preservation of Peace and Order, the Constitution of Courts of Justice, and Native Administration. This Order has been amended by the Southern Rhodesia Orders in Council of the 16th February, 1903, 10th August, 1909, 4th May, 1911, 11th February, 1/23, 10th August, 1914, 16th February, 1915, 2nd March, 1915, 27th June, 1916, and 28th July, 1916. Under the Order of 1898, as amended, there is a Resident Commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State. To assist the Administrator there is an Executive Council, composed of not less than three members appointed by the Company, with the approval of the Secretary of State. A member of the Executive Council holds office for a period of three years, unless sooner removed by the Company, but is eligible for re-appointment at the end of each term of office. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of the Administrator (President), six nominees of the Company approved by the Secretary of State, and twelve members elected by the Registered Voters. The Resident Commissioner sits on both the Executive and Legislative Councils, but without a vote. Ordinances passed by the Legislative Council, when assented to by the High Commissioner, take effect immediately, but within a year may be disallowed by the Secretary of State. The duration of each Legislative Council is three years. The first Legislative Council was elected in 1899. The number of Registered Voters in 1913 was 9,543.

By a Proclamation, dated 10th June, 1891, the laws of the Cape Colony in force on that date were adopted for and are administered in Southern Rhodesia as far as the circumstances of the country will permit, unless amended or repealed by the Legislative Council. The laws of the Cape Colony passed subsequent to the 10th June, 1891, do not apply to Rhodesia.

For the administration of justice there is a High Court with civil and criminal jurisdiction, the judges being appointed by the Secretary of State, on the nomination of the Company. In the districts there are Magistrates' Courts. Appeals from the High Court lie to the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, and thence to the Privy Council.

The administrative system of Northern Rhodesia is prescribed by the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council of 4th May, 1911, amended by Northern Rhodesia Orders in Council of 1914 (2), 1915, and 1916.

On the 9th October, 1914, His Majesty's Government published the following notice in the press:

"His Majesty's Government have had under their careful consideration the question of the future administration of the territories at present administered by the British South Africa Company. Clause 33 of the Company's Charter, which bears date the 29th day of October, 1889, reserves to the Crown the power at the end of twenty-five years from the date of the Charter, and at the end of every succeeding period of ten years, to add to or repeal any of the provisions of the Charter or to enact other provisions in substitution for or in addition to any of its existing provisions. It is further provided that this power shall only be exercised in relation to so much of the Charter as relates to administrative and public matters, and failing the exercise of this power the Charter is automatically extended for another ten years.

His Majesty's Government are advised that there is no power, either in the Charter or elsewhere, to shorten or vary the periods at the end of which addition to, or alteration or repeal of, the administrative provisions of the Charter is possible.

The Directors of the British South Africa Company have, however, informed Mr. Harcourt that they would not regard the non-exercise by His Majesty of his right of reviewing on the 29th instant such of the provisions of the Charter as relate to administrative and public matters as any bar to the establishment of Responsible Government, should the time appear to be ripe for such a step during the ten years which would elapse before, under the terms of the Charter, His Majesty's right of review would again become exercisable; and that if, during those ten years, the inhabitants of Southern Rhodesia should find that they were, financially and in other respects, strong enough to assume, with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government, the burden of administration, and should express through the Legislative Council their desire to assume that burden, they, the Directors, would be most willing that effect should be given to that desire.

In view of this statement and of the desire expressed by the Legislative Council for the continuance of the Company's administration, His Majesty's Government have decided not to advise His Majesty to exercise the powers reserved by Article 33 of the Charter, and its administrative and public provisions will accordingly not be modified. His Majesty will, however, be advised, in due course, to issue a Supplemental Charter, giving effect to the arrangement, to which the Directors of the British South Africa Company have agreed, to render possible the establishment of Responsible Government in Southern Rhodesia, should the Legislative Council desire it, and should His Majesty's Government concur, at some date other than that which the Charter permits."

A Supplemental Charter, giving effect to this arrangement, was issued on 13th March, 1915.

Local Government.

Salisbury and Bulawayo were constituted municipalities in October, 1897, Gwelo and Umtali in August, 1914, and Gatooma in August, 1917. Sanitary Boards are appointed for the other principal towns.

Native Administration.

The Native Department of Southern Rhodesia is administered by the Secretary for Native Affairs, the duties of the office at the present
time being undertaken by the Administrator. He is assisted by a Chief Native Commissioner, whose duties are defined by High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 32 of 1913. The Territory is divided into 32 native districts, each in charge of a Native Commissioner, who is appointed by the Administrator, with the approval of the High Commissioner, as laid down in the "Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," and whose duties are defined by the High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 55 of 1910 (promulgated 14th October, 1910).

Formerly the natives were scattered throughout the country, but now land has been reserved for tribal settlements which is suitable for their agricultural and pastoral requirements. A special Commission (The Native Reserves Commission) was appointed by the Imperial Authorities in 1914 for the purpose of finally defining these Native reservations.

The Commission concluded its investigations in December, 1915. His Majesty's Government decided to accept the recommendations of the Commission as a whole. These recommendations were to the effect that 5,610,595 acres should be assigned as additional reserves or extensions to existing reserves, but that 6,673,055 acres hitherto included within reserves are not required for that purpose. The total area of the reserves will therefore be reduced by 1,062,460 acres to 19,428,691 acres, which should be ample for the present and future requirements of the native population. The balance of 1,062,460 acres will be at the disposal of the Company, in the same manner as the rest of the unalienated land of the territory.

The only tax imposed upon the natives is an annual poll-tax of £1. Excellent provision has been made for those who go to work at the mines. Compounds have been erected and hospitals provided at most of the mines, which are periodically visited by Government Inspectors; their contracts are supervised by officials who see that the terms are faithfully fulfilled by the employers, and in the event of injustice they have their remedy in a court of law under the "Master's and Servant's Ordinance." A native at the mines can easily earn from 30s. to 3l. a month with food and lodging.

Climate.

The Rhodesian plateau lies at an altitude of from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. Broadly speaking, the year has two divisions, the wet and the dry season. The early rains of the wet season (which is the summer) gradually appear towards the end of October, increase in frequency and force until January, and disappear about the end of April. From May to September there is practically no rain. Taking into consideration the vast extent of the territory the climate naturally varies. In the highlands it is very healthy and bracing. Formerly, in the low-lying districts, malarial fever was very prevalent, but with the opening up of the country, better housing and food, it is rapidly disappearing. The summer is not oppressively hot, nor is the winter very cold. The average shown by the maximum and minimum thermometers in the shade at the principal towns, during the year ending 30th June, 1917, was:

| Town       | Max. | Min. |
|------------|------|------|
| Salisbury  | 80°8 | 52°0 |
| Bulawayo   | 78°5 | 54°4 |

Rainfall.

There are hospitals at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, Victoria, Hartley, Mazoe, Gwanda, Enkeldoorn, Gatooma, Abercorn, Sinoia and Gwelo, each supplied with a complete staff of doctors and nurses. Cottage hospitals have also been erected in various districts to meet the wants of the mining centres.

Population.

A census for Southern Rhodesia was taken on the 7th May, 1911, showing the number of Europeans to be 23,606 (Mashonaland, 12,631; Matabeleland, 10,975). Since that date it is estimated that the number of Europeans has increased by between 9,000 and 10,000, bringing the white population up to 32,852 approximately. The native population of Southern Rhodesia at 31st December, 1919, was estimated to be 770,000. There were also approximately 3,000 Asiatics and other coloured persons. The European population of Northern Rhodesia on the 7th May, 1911, was 1,497. The native population at 31st December, 1919, is estimated at 890,000. It is estimated that the European population has increased, approximately, to 2,400, since the date of the census.

Chief Towns.

The chief towns of Southern Rhodesia are Salisbury (the capital), Hartley, Gatooma, Umtali and Victoria in Mashonaland; and Bulawayo, Gwelo and Selukwe, in Matabeleland. Townships have also been formed at Rusapi, Gwanda, Enkeldoorn, Melsetter, Umvuma and at other places.

Salisbury, the seat of the Government, has a white population of about 4,000. The town stands 4,880 feet above sea level. Branches of the Standard Bank, National Bank of South Africa, and African Banking Corporation have been established.

Bulawayo is the commercial centre of Matabeleland, with a white population of 4,800 and stands 4,460 feet above the sea level. Branches of the same banks as at Salisbury have been opened. There is a public hospital which is one of the finest in South Africa. The town is on the main line of railway from Cape Town to the far north, and is distant from Cape Town 1,362 miles.

Railways.

The Bechuanaland Railways (now Rhodesia Railways, Limited) reached Bulawayo on the 19th October, 1897, and the line to that town was formally opened on the 4th November. An extension of the Beira Railway from Umtali reached Salisbury on the 1st May, 1899, and was opened on the 22nd May. On the 1st August, 1900, the widening of the gauge of the Beira Railway to 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa, was completed. On the 6th October, 1902, the line was completed between Salisbury and Bulawayo, a distance of 301 miles, thus establishing through communication between Cape Town and Beira (over 2,000 miles). The line passes through the mining districts of Hartley, Queque, Gwelo, Bembesi, etc.
railway from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls (282 miles) on the River Zambesi was completed in June, 1904, and the further extension northward, via Kalomo, to the Broken Hill Mine, 374 miles from the Falls, was opened for traffic on 1st September, 1906. Another section of the line from Broken Hill to the Congo Border (132 miles) was completed in December, 1909, by the Rhodesia-Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company, Limited. There is, therefore, through communication between Cape Town and the northern border of Northern Rhodesia, a total distance of 2,149 miles. A further extension to Kambove, in the Congo State (258 miles), has been constructed by the Compagnie du Chemin de fer du Katanga. This line has now been extended northwards to Bukama, 450 miles from the Congo Border. The Zambesi river is crossed by a bridge 650 feet long, 30 feet wide, and about 420 feet above the level of the water. The structure was formally opened by the late Sir G. H. Darwin, K.C.B., President of the British Association, on the 12th September, 1905.

A line from Heany Junction to the West Nicholson mine in the Gwanda district (103 miles), to open up the gold and coal areas to the south-east, has been constructed, and a line, with a 2-feet gauge, from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine in the Lomagundi district (34 miles), was opened for traffic on the 1st November, 1902. A branch (12 miles) has been made from this line to the Eldorado Mine. These two branches have since been widened to standard gauge (3 ft. 6 in.), when the last 17 miles of the narrow gauge line from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine was taken up. The line has since been extended beyond the Eldorado Mine across the Hunyani River into the Sinoia district (4 miles). A line from Gwelo to Selukwe (24 miles) was completed in August, 1903, and one from Lyndhurst Halt (near Gwelo) to Umvuma (50 miles), was opened in June, 1909.

An extension of this line to Victoria, a further 70 miles, was opened on the 10th July, 1914. At the same time the line to Umvuma was diverted from Lyndhurst Halt and taken direct into Gwelo. A railway from Mount Hampden Junction to the Jumbo Mine in the Mazoe district (about 22 miles) was on the 15th December, 1911, opened for traffic, and an extension of this line to Shamva in the Salisbury district, a distance of about 50 miles from the Jumbo Mine, was opened on 23rd April, 1913. A line to the Matopos, where Mr. Rhodes is buried, was opened for traffic on November 7th, 1903.

The total mileage of the Rhodesian Railway Systems (including the Beira Railways) at the end of 1919 was 2,168 miles.

Lands and Agriculture.

In 1897 a geodetic survey of Southern Rhodesia was initiated under the superintendence of the late Sir David Gill, K.C.B., H.M. Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, and was completed to the Zambesi river, in August, 1901.

Unimproved land in Southern Rhodesia may be purchased from the British South Africa Company outright for cash, subject to the fulfilment of a simple occupation condition, or it may be held under a permit of occupation with option of purchase for cash, or by instalments, at any time within ten years. The title deed gives the purchaser the freehold to the land subject to an annual payment of quit-rent, which is roughly £1 per 1,000 acres. Applications for land should be addressed to the Director of Land Settlement, Salisbury, Rhodesia. Information and handbooks can be supplied by the British South Africa Company, 2, London Wall Buildings, E.C. 2, or at the Rhodesia Information Office, 138 Strand, W.C. 2. The British South Africa Company has made a free grant of 500,000 acres towards a scheme for the settlement of ex-service men on the land, which has now been allocated.

Special steamship and railway facilities are given to bond fide farmer settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for the benefit of the farming community.

Considerable tracts of land have been placed under cultivation, and fresh stock is being imported. It may be said that virtually the whole of Southern Rhodesia is well watered, and adapted for stock-raising and for agriculture. Cattle generally do very well in all parts. Sheep and goats thrive in many parts and will do better after the grass is fed down. Pigs thrive well, and, so far, have never shown disease. Poultry and eggs always command a ready sale at remunerative prices. Throughout the country the conditions of soil and climate are suitable for all kinds of European cereals and vegetables, and, in addition, many trees, shrubs and plants peculiar to sub-tropical regions can be successfully cultivated. Maize, Kaffir-corn, and other native cereals grow well in the rainy season without irrigation. Tobacco culture has now passed the experimental stage, and the industry is being rapidly developed. The plant grows luxuriantly, and a considerable acreage is under cultivation. Maize, tobacco and oranges are being exported, and later it is hoped to export other products such as fibres and cotton. Large fruit orchards have been planted, and nearly all fruit trees thrive, the cultivation of oranges and lemons constituting a rapidly expanding industry. The sale of dairy produce is a profitable industry in the neighbourhood of the towns. Creameries and a bacon factory and oil-expressing plant have been successfully established, and a meat canning factory has commenced operations.

Ownership of the Unalienated Land in Southern Rhodesia.

On the 17th April, 1914, the following resolution was passed by the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia:

"(1.) That the ownership of the unalienated land in Southern Rhodesia is not vested in, and has never been acquired by, the British South Africa Company as their commercial or private property, and that such powers of taking possession of, dealing with or disposing of land in Southern Rhodesia as have been or are possessed by the British South Africa Company have been created by virtue of authority conferred by Her Majesty the Queen in Council and her successors upon the Company, as the governing body charged for the time being by Her Majesty in Council and her successors with the general administration of affairs within the said territory and responsible for the maintenance of law, order, and good government therein."
"(2.) That if by the exercise of the said powers and the taking possession of, dealing with and disposing of the said land or by any other means, the British South Africa Company have acquired an ownership of the said land, such ownership is so vested in them as an administrative and public asset only, and the Company in their capacity other than Government and Administration have no dominium or estate in or title to the said lands or to any moneys or revenues derived therefrom.

"(3.) That on the said Company ceasing to be the Government of the said territory, and ceasing to exercise the administration of affairs therein, all such lands as may be unalienated at such time shall be and remain the property of the Government of the said territory which shall take the place of the said Company, and the possession and administration of such land shall pass to such Government as public domain."

These contentions were disputed by the British South Africa Company, and by Order in Council, dated the 16th July, 1914, His Majesty was graciously pleased to refer to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for hearing and consideration the Question "whether the contentions put forward in the said Resolution of the 17th April, 1914, are well founded?"

The hearing of the Special reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, before Earl Loreburn and Lords Dunedin, Atkinson, Sumner, and Scott Dickson, began on the 16th April, 1918, and occupied eleven days. Their Lordships' Report, which was delivered by Lord Sumner on the 29th July, 1918, concludes as follows:

"Their Lordships will humbly report to His Majesty that they affirm the first paragraph of the resolution passed on the 17th April, 1914, and deny the third, and that as to the second they say that, so long as the British South Africa Company continues to administer Southern Rhodesia under the Crown, it is entitled to dispose of the unalienated lands in due course of administration, and to apply the moneys or revenues derived therefrom in duly reimbursing all proper outlays on administrative account in the current or in past years; and, if its administration of Southern Rhodesia should be determined by the Crown, then the right to look to the Crown to secure to it (either out of the proceeds of further sales of the lands by whomsoever made, or, if the Crown should grant away these lands or proceeds to others from public funds), the due reimbursement of any outstanding balance of aggregate advances made by it for necessary and proper expenditure upon the administration of Southern Rhodesia. This, however, and the other rights hereinbefore mentioned, do not vest in it dominium or estate in or title to the said unalienated lands."

In July, 1919, a Commission, of which Viscount Cave was Chairman, was appointed to investigate the records and accounts of the British South Africa Company in London and Rhodesia, and to make all such enquiries as might be deemed desirable, and to take an account of what would be due to the Company in accordance with the report of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, if the administration of Southern Rhodesia by the Company had been determined on the 31st March, 1918. The Commission proceeded to Rhodesia, where it held several sittings. On its return to London, the sittings were resumed, and are still proceeding.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails from the United Kingdom to Southern Rhodesia are conveyed by the mail steamers of the subsidised Union-Castle Company between Southampton and Table Bay. From Cape Town they are conveyed by train to Bulawayo in 3 days. Mail and passenger trains leave Cape Town for Bulawayo on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, performing the journey in 3 days. From Bulawayo to Salisbury the mails are conveyed four times a week, the journey occupying about 20 hours. There are two mail and passenger trains weekly between Salisbury and Beira, the time occupied on the journey being about 23 hours.

A few of the outlying districts of Southern Rhodesia are still served by mail coaches and carts.

Northern Rhodesia receives its mails via Bulawayo. They are conveyed from Bulawayo via the Victoria Falls and Broken Hill, to Livingstone by train, and to the several postal stations in the territory by native runners. Mail matter may, however, still be forwarded to Fort Jameson and other stations in the Eastern portion of the territory by the Chinde and Blantyre route. The time occupied in the transmission of the mails between Fort Jameson and the United Kingdom is now five weeks and two days.

On the 31st of December, 1918, 104 post offices were open in Southern Rhodesia, at 35 of which Money Order and Savings Bank business was transacted. Telegraph Money Orders are also exchanged between Money Order Offices in Rhodesia and with the United Kingdom, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony.

The rate for inland letters is 1d. per ½ oz., plus War postage of ½d. per ½ oz., and the same rate to other parts of South Africa. The rate for letters for places over-sea was reduced from 2½d. to 1½d. per ½ oz. from 1st April, 1911, but in terms of the War Postage Ordinance, 1917, has been increased to 2½d. per ½ oz. The rate for letters from the United Kingdom to Rhodesia is 1½d. for the 1st oz., then 1½d. per oz.

The Rhodesian Telegraph and Telephone system extends from Ramathlabama, on the northern border of Cape Colony, to Ujiji in East Africa, and comprises 9,269 miles of wire, on 3,673 miles of poles.

On the 31st December, 1918, 119 telegraph offices were open. The rate for Inland telegrams is 1d. per word; for telegrams exchanged between Rhodesia and other parts of South Africa, 2½d. per word; and for cablegrams to Europe is 2s. 2½d. per word. Telegrams from Europe and from South Africa, for the Portuguese province of Manica and Sofala, Portuguese East Africa (including Chinde and Quilimane), the Nyasaland Protectorate, and North Eastern Rhodesia, all pass over the Rhodesian lines.

Telephone exchanges are in operation at 106 towns and mining centres.

Post Office Savings Banks were established on 1st January, 1905. Up to 31st December, 1918, the amount deposited was £1,204,783., and the amount withdrawn was £1,076,501. £157,192. has been invested in Trustee Securities.
Customs.

Prior to the 1st August, 1899, no duties were leviable upon goods entering Southern Rhodesia. On that date the Customs Ordinance came into operation, and continued in force till August, 1903, when, as a result of the South African Customs Conference, the necessary Ordinance empowering Southern Rhodesia to enter the newly formed Customs Union was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council. This Convention of 1903 was superseded by that of 1906. The Tariff was amended in 1908. On the 30th June, 1910, the Customs Union was terminated by mutual consent, but an agreement has been entered into between Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa, by which the tariff was unaltered.

In August, 1914, "The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," was amended by "The Southern Rhodesia (Customs) Amendment Order in Council, 1914."

The chief effect of the Amendment is that Rhodesia is empowered to impose higher import duties than those limited by previous legislation on tobacco and intoxicating liquor, and the imposition of excise and surtax on certain articles manufactured in South Africa and Rhodesia.

Under two Ordinances, Nos. 8 and 9 of 1914, promulgated on 14th August, the duty and excise on intoxicating liquor was raised from 6s. to 12s. a gallon and an excise and surtax were imposed of cigarettes. Under Ordinance No. 8 of 1917, the duty and excise on intoxicating liquor was increased to 15s. a gallon.

"The Customs, Tariff and Management Amending Ordinance, 1914," amending the Ordinances of 1906, 1908 and 1910, and a further Ordinance imposing an import and excise duty on beer and matches were promulgated on 13th November, and under these new Customs regulations and tariffs were published setting out Customs duties now leviable.

In 1914 a new Customs Agreement was entered into between the Union of South Africa and the Administrations of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, rendered necessary by the amendment of its Customs tariff by the Union Parliament, and in 1915, a Customs Agreement on similar lines was entered into between Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia.

An Ordinance, amending in some respects the Customs and Excise tariffs and imposing Excise duties upon sugar and playing cards, was promulgated on the 25th June, 1915.

The estimated value (exclusive of Customs Duty) of merchandise entered for consumption in Southern Rhodesia, as compared with the value of exports, for 1918, and the preceding four years is shewn in the table below. In these figures the value of specie and of imported goods re-exported has been excluded.

| Year ended 31st Dec., | Imports | Exports |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| 1914                 | £3,731,300 | £1,130,682 |
| 1915                 | £2,949,652 | £4,537,337 |
| 1916                 | £3,503,418 | £1,591,063 |
| 1917                 | £3,276,252 | £5,127,538 |
| 1918                 | £3,994,320 | £4,410,955 |

The net revenue received from Customs and Excise during 1918 was £277,903. 5s. 1d., as compared with £229,875l. 1s. 7d. for 1917.

Minerals.

Gold.—That gold was obtained from Rhodesia in prehistoric times is evidenced from the innumerable "ancient workings," the ruins of temples and forts supposed to date from the time of the Himyarites and Phoenicians, and the discovery of gold beads, gold plates, fine chains, wire, nails, etc. From the occupation of the country in 1890 by the British South Africa Company when the European population amounted to about 500 persons, consisting of the pioneers and a few officials, up to September, 1898, the gold produced only amounted to 6,470 ounces. Since that date, however, the output has been steadily increasing.

| Year | Fine Gold | Estimated Value |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1916 | 930,355 ozs. | £3,895,311 |
| 1917 | 834,230 ,,   | 3,495,391 |
| 1918 | 631,357 ,,   | 2,652,498 |
| 1919 | 593,223 ,,   | 2,490,498 |

Coal.—For some years past coal has been known to exist in several districts. In the Wankie District, 212 miles from Bulawayo, and 70 miles from the Victoria Falls on the River Zambesi, a coal bed of large extent is being worked. The result of careful and systematic examination shows that as regards quality the coal is only from 4 to 6 per cent. inferior to Welsh steam coal of similar quality. During the 12 months ended 31st December, 1919, the output amounted to 510,040 tons, as against 491,268 tons in 1918. Other promising discoveries of coal have been made in the Victoria, Tuli and Sebungwe districts, also in North-Western Rhodesia, but, so far, sufficient exploratory work has not been carried out to admit of a final opinion being pronounced as to their precise value.

The output of silver during the 12 months ended 31st December, 1919, was 171,995 ozs., and for 1918, 175,722 ozs.

Copper.—Discoveries of copper have been reported in the Victoria, Lomagundu and Gwelo districts in Southern Rhodesia, and highly promising deposits have been disclosed in Northern Rhodesia. During the year 1919, 3,011 tons of copper have been produced in Southern Rhodesia, principally from the Falcon mine. Tin has also been discovered in the Victoria and Salisbury districts in Southern Rhodesia.

During 1905 diamonds were discovered in the Gwelo district, and 13,210 carats have been declared up to the 31st December, 1917.

Discoveries of asbestos have been made in the Victoria district of Mashonaland, and in the Belingwe district of Matabeleland, and during the 12 months ended 31st December, 1919, the output amounted to 9,798 tons, as against 8,574 tons in 1918.

Amongst other minerals, 206 tons of Tungsten ores, and 616,840 tons of chrome iron ore, have been exported up to 31st December, 1919.

Education.

On the 31st December, 1918, there were in Southern Rhodesia 76 Government and 4 aided schools. During the year 1 new school was opened. The total number of children in Government-aided schools was 4,584 as against 4,063 for the previous year. The total expenditure from Government funds amounted to 105,243 and 28,399 was received in respect of tuition fees. The number of native schools which received Government grants during 1918 was 148 as compared with 593 for 1917.

In 1910 two High Schools (one for boys and one for girls) were opened both in Salisbury and
Bulawayo, which provide an education fully equal to the best secondary schools in England. The number of pupils enrolled has far exceeded expectations, and in 1917 showed satisfactory increases.

Owing to the munificent bequests of the late Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Beit, largely increased educational facilities are now afforded. Scholarships and Bursaries are granted to pupils in the country, and, in addition, there are nine "Rhodes Scholarships" (three per annum) by which a Rhodesian can secure a three years' course at Oxford University.

Sir William H. Milton, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., after a term of office extending over sixteen years, resigned the position of Administrator of Southern Rhodesia in October, 1914, and was succeeded by Mr. (now Sir) Drummond Chaplin.

SOUTH WEST AFRICA.

On the outbreak of war in 1914, the Imperial Government cabled to the Acting Governor-General that they regarded as an urgent necessity the seizure of the coast wireless stations at Swakopmund and Luderitzbucht, and the Union Government at once agreed to send an expedition for the purpose, in conjunction with Imperial Naval operations. The campaign was completely successful, and the territory is now administered by the Union Government, Germany having renounced all her rights.

The expenditure for the financial year ended on the 31st March, 1918, was £650,052.

The revenue collected amounted to £295,402., of which £200,000 came from the tax on diamonds.

The value of imports during 1918, was £1,031,534. There were no direct importations from overseas, and all goods came from or via the Union, the volume representing 3½ of the total export trade of the Union.

A decided change for the worse came over the economic position of the German community in the second half of the year, due in large measure to the wholly fictitious value at which German paper money had been maintained by the local German banks and traders. This rate was 24 marks the £ sterling until November, when it became 28½, at which figure it was kept until the close of the year. (Since then this artificial rate has broken down, and most of the traders are now declining to deal except on a basis of "hard cash.") Instances are known of farmers who, filled with confidence in the ultimate issue of the war, sold large numbers of cattle for sterling and converted this sterling into paper currency, thus showing in their books a big profit on their farming transactions; but with the fall in the rate of exchange these individuals have been badly hit.

Notwithstanding the relatively unfavourable economic position the number of European indigents maintained or assisted by the Administration fell to 310 adults, and 170 children, as against 477 and 277 in 1917, and 639 and 367 in 1916, which indicates that a fair number of those able to work were absorbed into different forms of employment.

The repatriation of Germans accounts for some 6,000, leaving approximately 6,000 of the pre-war German population still resident. The total European population in 1913 was 14,830, which included 12,292 Germans and 1,650 "Kolonial-englantler" (mostly Dutch South Africans). Of the 12,292 Germans, 1,220 adult males were engaged in farming pursuits, and of the 1,650 British Colonials, 299 were so engaged. The British Colonials consisted of 636 men, 361 women and 653 children, and such of them as were on farms were settled mainly in the Southern and more arid half of the territory, to which area most of the farmers (not a great number) who have entered during the Union occupation have proceeded. There are large unoccupied areas in the country suitable for settlement, but much of the land is claimed by Concession Companies, such as the South-West Africa Company and the Kaokoveld Company, and the greater portion of the unoccupied Crown Lands is without open water and lies at considerable distances from existing centres of population. A very large expenditure on bores, wells, or dams will, moreover, be necessary to make these lands available to the settlers; but such expenditure will undoubtedly be amply justified as the country offers unsampled opportunities for ranching.

There will therefore, in all probability be a period of stagnation in commercial circles; but probably this will not adversely affect the revenues of the Protectorate, the bulk of which, for some years to come, will be derived from the tax on diamonds.

The position of the farming community is, on the whole, eminently sound, and each year sees better prices for the slaughter stock available for sale. This is, however, a land of big farms mostly fit for ranching purposes only and wide distances, and closer settlement is not to be thought of except in limited areas along the Fish River, in which in years to come it may be found practicable to embark upon conservation and irrigation schemes.

The rural European population will for many years remain a small one in comparison with the size of the country, though perhaps as civilization extends and tropical diseases are overcome, a population of greater density may be supported in the North Eastern (Okavango) area on sections which are present almost wholly unexplored, but which in the matter of rainfall, soil and native labour possess many advantages not found in the rest of the Protectorate, and may be expected to be suitable for crops such as cotton, tobacco and grain.
