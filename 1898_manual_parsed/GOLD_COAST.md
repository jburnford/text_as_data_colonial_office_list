THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation, Area, and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast is the name given to that portion of Upper Guinea, between 3° W. long. and 1° 10' E. long., and is bounded on the West by the French settlements of Assinie, and on the east by the German colony of Togoland.

The country is inhabited by a large number of native tribes more or less independent of each other, but with similar customs and forms of government. Each tribe has its own head chief or king, and every town or village of the tribe a chief. The chiefs form the king's council, and assist him in dealing with matters affecting the general welfare of the tribe. The succession both to the king's and chiefs' stools is for the most part hereditary by the female side, the heir to the stool being the son of the occupant's eldest sister, or failing male offspring by his sisters, his brothers according to seniority, and back from them to the male offspring of his aunts on the father's side.

The principal coast tribes are the following:—Appollonia, Ahanta, Chama, Kommenda, Elmina, Cape Coast or Fanti, Winneba, Assin Gomoa, Accra, Adangme, Awuana, Agbosome and Aflao. Some of these, on account of tribal differences are split up into divisions more or less independent of each other, and as education and civilization spread, a tendency to further disintegration develops itself.

In the interior the principal tribes are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wassaw, Sefwihi, upper and lower Jenkera, Tchutul, Assin, Esse Kuma, Edjumako, eastern and western Akim, Akwapim, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepi, Kwahu, Atabubu, Shai, Ningo, Krikor, and Anum.

For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into fourteen districts, each presided over by a commissioner, who besides performing judicial duties as magistrate, is the Chief Executive Officer of the district. The headquarters of each district with two exceptions, are on the coast.

The districts are known by the following names:—Wassaw, Axim, Dixcove, Chama, Elmina, Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winneba, Accra, Pram, Ada, Kwitta, Volta River, Krepi and Kwahu.

History.

It is generally accepted that the Gold Coast, with the adjacent territories bordering on the Gulf of Guinea, were discovered by French navigators in the fourteenth century. The first really historic accounts that are extant of the Gold Coast are dated 1366, when a company was formed at Rouen, to trade with West Africa. Thirty years later the French established themselves in force at a place which they named La Mine, now called Elmina, and built there a large castle, the towers and bastions of which are still well preserved. The Rouen Company remained predominant on the Coast for nearly a century, when their trade failed, and they finally abandoned it.

The fame of the wealth of the Gold Coast attracted a large number of adventurers of all nations to the Gulf of Guinea, and during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a vast number of factories were established at various points along the seaboard, and the trade of the coast was eagerly disputed by the French, Portuguese, Danes, English, Bradenburgers, Dutch and Swedes, who dotted the whole coast line with formidable forts, erected to defend their commerce.

In 1672 an English company was formed, called the Royal African Company, which built forts at Dixcove, Sekundu, Kommenda, Anamabu, Winnela, Accra, and Whyda, besides strengthening Cape Coast Castle, which was already in existence. It was succeeded in 1750 by the African Company of Merchants, constituted by Act of Parliament, with liberty to trade and to form establishments on the West Coast of Africa, between 20° N. and 20° S. lat. This company, which received an annual subsidy from the Government, suffered by the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, and was dissolved in 1821 by Act of Parliament, and the forts transferred to the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlements. The fort at Whyda was abandoned.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macartney, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fantis in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Ensimankao, where on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowa, near Accra, in 1827. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831 between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, His Majesty's Government had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only 4,000l. a year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast Protectorate. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the Slave Trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, and a Lieut.-Governor appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of
Native Affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

In 1850, the Danish forts at Christiansborg, Tessi, Ningo, Ada, and Kitta were purchased from the King of Denmark for 10,000l., the Danish Protectorate, which included the country inhabited by the Shais, Krobos (Eastern and Western), Akims (Eastern and Western), Akwapins, Akwamus, and Kreps being at the same time transferred.

In 1852 a large meeting of the native chiefs (afterwards known as the "Legislative Assembly") agreed to pay a poll tax in exchange for British protection. This tax gradually fell in arrear, and was abandoned, though some was received up to 1861.

Interspersed amongst the British settlements there had always been a number of Dutch forts. This circumstance was an abiding source of embarrassment to the British Government, as the Dutch settlements being free ports, no appreciable customs duties could be imposed at the British ports. A partition of the coast was therefore effected by a Convention which came into force on the 1st of January, 1868, the Dutch taking the country west of the Sweet river, the British that lying to the east. The Dutch acquired Dixcove, Appolonia, Sekondi, and Kommenda; the British acquired Dutch Accra, Berraku, Appam, Kormantine, and Mori. Her Majesty also relinquished to the King of Holland the protectorate over the two Wassaws, Appolonia, Tchuful, and Denkera.

The Dutch found their new possessions extremely unruly. Their authority was defied by the protected tribes of the interior, and their officers outraged and ill-treated on the coast; and by a convention, signed at the Hague in 1871, they abandoned to Great Britain the whole of their rights on the coast. Before the Convention was ratified, an assurance was first sought and received from the King of Ashanti that he had no claim on the Dutch settlements of Elmina, and the forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872.

Relations with Ashanti.

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwai, Juabins, Kokofus, Kumasi, Danissiass, Mampons, Nsutas, Nkwantas, Dadiassi, Oflinsus, and Adjisu. Each tribe has its own king, but from time immemorial the King of Kumasi has been recognized as the King paramount of the Confederation. As King paramount, he succeeds to what is known as the "golden stool" and is installed by the Kings of Bekwai, Juabin, and Kokofu, the ceremony of enthronement lasting several weeks, and being observed by the performance of native customs, which in times past consisted largely in the sacrifice of slaves.

On 9th Dec., 1872, the King of Ashanti, despatched from Kumasi an army of 40,000 men to invade the British Protectorate. His army crossed the Pra on the 29th of January, 1873, and spread itself slowly over the country, ravaging as it advanced. In April it met and defeated the Fanti allies at Dunkwa, and again in June at Jukwa, and then attacked the fortress of Elmina, where it was entirely defeated by the seamen and Marines of the Fleet, in conjunction with the Colonial Forces, all under the command of the late Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing.

After this the war languished for some time, until the late Captain, afterwards Sir John Glover, was commissioned to repair to the eastern districts of the Protectorate, and organise the tribes in that quarter for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, now Viscount, Wolseley, was despatched with troops to the Gold Coast. The British troops arrived early in December, but a good road to the Pra not having been completed, they were sent to sea again. In the meantime Sir Garnet Wolseley, by the aid of native levies, West Indian troops, and seamen and Marines, had been driving the enemy towards the Pra, which they crossed in the end of November. The white troops landed towards the end of December, and Sir Garnet Wolseley and his headquarters crossed the Pra on the 20th of January. The King of Ashanti now begged for peace, and sent the captive missionaries and others to the British camp; but as his language and acts were not satisfactory, Sir Garnet Wolseley continued his advance, and on the 31st of January came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoofor, where, after desperate resistance, he drove them from their position. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Kumasi. The King had fled to the bush. Negotiations were opened with him, but without result, and on the 6th Sir Garnet Wolseley quitted Kumasi and commenced his march to the Coast, the Royal Engineers firing the city as the force marched out. In the meantime Sir John Glover had been advancing from the east with Hausas and native allies, and on the 12th he passed through the burning ruins of Kumasi. On the 13th messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fommana, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Kofi. By the Treaty of Fommana the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, to keep up a good road to the Pra, to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold, and to respect the independence of the Adansis, a tribe inhabiting the country between Pra and that of the powerful Ashanti tribe of Bekwai. King Kofi Kari-Kari was deposed, and was succeeded by King Mensah, who, in his turn, was deposed in 1881.

Early in 1881 fresh troubles broke out with Ashanti, the affair having at one time a serious aspect. Awusu, a prince of Gaman, who was also connected with the Ashanti Royal family, escaped from Kumasi, where he had been kept under surveillance, to Elmina. He was followed by Ashanti ambassadors, demanding that he should be at once sent back. These envoys brought with them the golden axe, an emblem which was considered by the Government to be a threat of war. The demand was of course refused, and preparations were commenced by Lieut.-Governor (now Sir Brandford) Griffith for the defence of the Protectorate. Reinforcements from the West India Regiments at Sierra Leone and the West Indies were despatched, a small Naval Brigade was landed, and early in March Sir Samuel Rowe, who had just been appointed Governor, arrived. About the same time Ashanti messengers were sent to deny that any threat of war had been intended. The force in the Colony now consisted of about 1,200 men of the W.I. Regiments and Hausa Police. In April the Ashanti ambassadors were received by the Governor at Prasu, and eventually an apology from them, together with 2,000 ounces of gold as an indemnity, was accepted. The gold axe was sent home as a present to the Queen.
After an interregnum of about two years, during which period much trouble and disturbance of trade was occasioned through intrigues designed to replace Kari-Kari upon "The Stool," Kwaku Dua was elected king in April, 1884, but he died June, 1884.

After the death of Kwaku Dua II dissension broke out among the confederated tribes. The Kokofus and Juabins fought against each other, the latter were driven out of the country, a large number finding an asylum within the Protectorate, and being located at Konforodua, where they have built a town and still reside. Dissensions also arose as to the succession to Kwaku. The Kokofus, Mampons, Nsutas, Nkwantas and Dadiassis favoured the claims of Atcheri Boanda, while the Kumasis, Bekwais, Ofinsus and Adjissus advocated those of Prempeh. Wars ensued, resulting in great loss of life and injury to trade, and Captains Lonsdale and Barnett were therefore sent to Ashanti to endeavour to adjust differences, and in April, 1888, Prempeh, whose adherents had gradually driven their adversaries out of the country into the Protectorate, was recognised as king. He took the title of Kwaku Dua III, but was never placed on the Golden Stool in accordance with native custom, and was never therefore actually king of Ashanti. From time to time he made overtures to the kings of the fugitive tribes with a view to their return to Ashanti, but the principal condition, namely, that he should be recognized as king paramount and placed on the Golden Stool, was not acceptable and the proposals fell through.

In 1894 Prempeh, having successfully fought against the Nkranzas who had revolted against his rule, threatened to attack the Attabubus who had been given protection in 1890. This attack was averted by the despatch of a force under Sir Francis Scott, and an ultimatum was then sent to Prempeh warning him not to enter British territory, and suggesting that he should acquiesce in the establishment of a Residency at Kumasi. No definite reply to this suggestion could be obtained, and in 1895 Prempeh sent messengers to England who were not received. A further ultimatum was sent to him in September, to which he was requested to reply by the 31st October. No reply was sent, and a military expedition to Kumasi, to compel compliance with the demands of Her Majesty's Government, was therefore decided upon. The expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Scott, entered Kumasi without resistance, January, 1896. Prempeh made submission, but, failing to comply with the terms dictated, was brought to the coast as a political prisoner and lodged in Elmina Castle. A Resident was at the same time installed at Kumasi, and thus has commenced an entirely new departure in the relations of the Gold Coast Colony with Ashanti.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by letters patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument Lagos was separated from the Gold Coast and formed into a distinct colony. Provision was made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Two unofficial members have been appointed to the Legislative Council.

By Order of the Queen in Council of 6th August, 1874, the Legislature was empowered to regulate by Ordinance or Ordinances all such powers as Her Majesty may enjoy in the protected territories.

The Supreme Court of the Colony was a Court of Appeal for Lagos, and also under the West African Order in Council, 1884, but legislation providing for the establishment of separate courts of appeal in each colony was passed in 1888.

**Law and Justice.**

The law of the colony is the common law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application in force in England on the 24th July, 1874, modified by a large number of Local Ordinances passed at various periods since that date. The Criminal Law was codified in 1892, and civil and criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Ordinance passed in 1876.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court presided over by the Chief Justice, Divisional Courts held in different parts of the colony by two puisne judges, and thirteen inferior Courts with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction presided over by District Commissioners. The Supreme Court has an original civil and criminal jurisdiction, and decides appeals from the inferior courts in civil matters, while the Chief Justice has a power of revision of the decisions of the Commissioners in criminal cases. Appeals from Divisional Courts are heard by a full court.

Native law is administered in all the Courts, in as far as it is not incompatible with any Statute or Ordinance, and not repugnant to natural justice.

The Forts of St. James at Accra, St. Jago at Elmina, and Cape Coast Castle are utilised as prisons pending the erection of a central prison at Accra.

At Accra convicts are taught trades, remunerative industries are carried on, and the English penal system is carried out in a modified form.

**Climate.**

The climate is very unhealthy, especially for Europeans. In 1891 the death rate among the non-official European population was 32-7 per 1,000; in 1892, 70-7 per 1,000; in 1893, 64-93 per 1,000; in 1894, 19-6 per 1,000; 59-02 per 1,000 in 1895; and 48-78 per 1,000 in 1896; and among the European officials 30-7 per 1,000 in 1891; 36-3 per 1,000 in 1892; 31-25 per 1,000 in 1893; 33-7 per 1,000 in 1894; 83-33 per 1,000 in 1895; and 60-10 per 1,000 in 1896. No data are at hand for estimating the death rate among the natives. Infant mortality is great. The mean temperature in the shade during the past seven years was, at Accra, 85° F. The average annual rainfall at the same place and during the same period was 17-33 inches. The rainfall varies with the physical configuration of the country, and is very great in Axim and the mining districts of Tarkwa, Upper and Lower Wassaw, etc. The "first rains," or rainy season proper, begin in March and end in July, the "latter rains" are spread over the months of September and October. The Harmattan season begins in December and ends in February. It is characterized by a cool wind which is sometimes dry and bracing.
but often moist and then very depressing. The climate generally is hot and moist and very malarious.

Domestic Slavery.

Domestic slavery existed from time immemorial on the Gold Coast, as in other parts of Africa, the slave population consisting partly of native-born slaves, and partly of Doukos, slaves purchased from Ashanti importers. Slavery was mainly an emanation of parental authority, every man being saleable either by his father or mother, according to the character of the union subsisting between his parents, and the consequent status of the mother; but there was also a species of slavery called pawning, founded on contract, which arose when a debtor gave to his creditor, as a security, either himself, or a child or slave, to be a temporary slave in the hands of the creditor until debt and interest were paid.

Within the British possessions on the Gold Coast, slavery was abolished by force of the statute 3 & 4 Will. IV., c. 73, but no attempt had been made to deal with it in the Protectorate, which was not affected by that statute. The harsher usages of slavery were, however, appreciably mitigated by the action of the court of the "judicial assessor to the Native Chiefs" and other magistrates. At the conclusion of the war of 1873-4 the question was taken in hand anew by the newly established Legislative Council at its first meeting, and settled by two ordinances. One of these prohibits, under penalties, the introduction of slaves into the Protectorate, and the buying and selling, and pawning of slaves and other persons within the Protectorate; and the second declares, that henceforth no court, native or British, shall take notice of, so as to give effect to, the relations between master and slave, except in so far as those relations may be in accordance with the law of England relating to master and servant.

Mail and Steamship Service.

A steamer of the British and African Company, or the African Steamship Company, leaves Liverpool every Saturday, calling at Grand Canary, Sierra Leone, Cape Coast and Accra, the length of the voyage to Accra being 21 days. Every alternate Wednesday one of these two companies' steamers leaves Liverpool touching at Madeira and Teneriffe and every port on the West Coast as far as Kwitta, the voyage to Kwitta being timed to occupy 28 days. Every 20 and 21 days steamers of the above two lines leave Hamburg calling at most of the West African ports as far as Kwitta, the voyage to Accra occupying 29 days.

There is a monthly departure from Liverpool of one of the Company's steamers for Sierra Leone, Accra, Lagos, and ports on the South-West Coast as far as Louanda, the journey averaging 41 days. There is also a German line of steamers starting from Hamburg, and a French line starting from Havre, which call at the Gold Coast and other ports.

Internal Communication.

There is no railway in the colony, but in 1893 a survey for a line from Kormantin Bay, about 3 miles west of Saltpond, was commenced, and in 1894 completed as far north as Insuani, on the left bank of the Birrim River. The question of constructing the railway is under consideration.

The only roads properly so called in the colony are, the road between Accra and Christiansborg, a distance of 24 miles, the road from the latter place to the Government Sanitarium at Aburi, a distance of 26 miles, the military road between Cape Coast and Prahsu, a distance of 75 miles, and the road from Cape Coast to Anamaboe, a distance of 12 miles. In addition to these the road from Aburi through Akwapim and Eastern and Western Krobo to Kpong and Akuse, and the road from Chama to Tarkwa (Upper Wassaw) are all under more or less constant Government supervision, and on that account are kept in fair order. The native kings and chiefs who can be induced to keep their bush tracks clear of bush and passable for traders and travellers at all periods of the year are paid 10s. a quarter, per mile, and cutlasses and hatchets are loaned to them by the Government to assist them in the work, but it is only within the immediate vicinity of the several Government stations that the bush-tracks are as a rule in fair order. A European Staff has been appointed, and attached to the Department of the D. P. W. to supervise the maintenance of roads and the construction of new ones, and road overseers have been appointed in several districts.

The principal waterway is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and falls into the sea at Ada, after a course of 200 miles. It is usually navigable for not more than 60 miles, and only for small boats. The Ankobra River is navigable for boats for about 50 miles. The Pra is almost useless as a waterway.

There is no harbour along the whole coast of the colony, and goods and passengers must everywhere be landed in surf-boats through what is often a dangerous surf.

Postal Communication.

The Colony is included in the Postal Union. Foreign money-order and parcel-post systems are in operation between it and the United Kingdom, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate. An inland postal-order system has been introduced for facilitating the exchange of small remittances between the principal stations in the Colony. A tri-weekly postal service is maintained between all the principal stations, a weekly service between the Colony and the French protectorate of Grand Bassam and Assinie, as well as between the sea coast stations and Kumasi in the Hinterland, and a bi-weekly service between the Colony and the German protectorate of Togoland. The number of letters, &c., posted and received in 1896 was 565,148 and 1,948,404 respectively. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Newspapers, Books, Printed Papers, Patterns, and Samples. |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Within the Colony (By land post)                          | 1d. per ½ oz. |
| To all parts of the World (excepting places in the interior of Africa served by way of Cape Colony and Natal) | 2½d. per 4 oz. |

Parcels to and from England, 9d. per lb.

Inter-colonial posts 6d. per lb.

Money Order commission, 2d. on every 10s.

Telegraphs and Telephones.

Telegraphs were first introduced in 1882, when a line, 2½ miles long, was put up between Accra and Christiansborg. This line was in 1885 extended to Aburi. Lines have since been constructed along the coast from Accra, a distance of 180 miles, to Axim, connecting the coast towns in the
west of the Colony, and also extended as far as the German boundary on the east, a distance of 114 liiles, joining the line erected by the German Government from Little Popo and Lome, and connecting the German settlement of Togoland with the telegraph system of the Gold Coast and with cable communication with Europe. In January, 1894, the construction of a line from Ada, at the mouth of the Volta, to Akuse and Kpong, towns of some commercial importance between fifty and sixty miles up the river, was completed, and a line has since been put up from Cape Coast to Prahsu and Kumasi, a distance of 135 miles. The Colony now possesses 515 miles of telegraph lines and twenty-four telegraph offices. Wooden poles were tried at first, but owing to the ravages of the white ant, iron poles were subsequently used, and have now almost entirely replaced them. In 1893 the number of messages forwarded was 60,031, in 1894, 73,776, in 1895, 81,696, and in 1896, 84,730.

A telephone exchange was opened at Accra in 1890, which now provides communication between 23 public and private offices, and Aburi is connected with this exchange. Accra is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Sierra Leone, St. Vincent, Madeira; also with Grand Bassam on the west, and Lagos and Brass, Bonny Cameroons and St. Thomas on the east. It is also connected with the Cape, via Kotou, St. Paul de Louanda, and Mossamedes, there being altogether four cables.

Defence.

Most of the stations along the coast have old forts, but there are no modern fortifications. A colonial armed constabulary force (Hausas) was raised by Captain Glover, R.N. (afterwards Sir John Glover), and Mr. (now Sir Roger Goldsworthy) for service in the Ashanti War of 1873-4, and was known as Glover's Hausas. The establishment is at present 23 European officers, 10 native officers, 80 non-commissioned officers, and 1,300 privates. The organization is military, and the force is available for service in any of the British West African Colonies. It is divided into artillery and infantry, the former armed with 16 7-pounder R.M.L. guns, 4 Maxim, 3 Nordenfelt, 1 Gatling machine gun, 3 4½-howitzers, 3 4½-mortars, and 18 (9-pr. and 24-pr.) rocket troughs.

The infantry are armed with Lee-Metford carbines and sword-bayonets.

Gold Coast Rifle Volunteers.

The establishment of which is at present 18 officers, 32 non-commissioned officers, 10 buglers, 240 privates. The force is armed with Martini-Henri carbines and sword-bayonets.

Education.

Elementary education in the Colony is chiefly in the hands of the Wesleyan, Roman Catholic, and Basel Missionary Societies, which receive annual grants from the Government. The Government has established schools at Accra, Cape Coast, and Insuaim, W. Akim, the two former schools being under the direct supervision of European masters; there are also Government schools in connection with the Hansa Constabulary and Civil Police Forces. The various missions have their schools situated in outlying districts, reaching far into the interior. The Wesleyan Society has, since the close of the Ashanti Expedition, established schools in Kumasi and the neighbourhood, but these are not yet under inspection. A scheme of industrial education is being introduced into the Government schools at Accra and Cape Coast, and many of the mission schools in the interior have small plantations attached, where the scholars receive instruction in the cultivation of coffee and other native products. The Basel Mission has also established a training school for their teachers at Akropong.

Returns of assisted schools in the Colony:

| Number of Schools | Number of Scholars | Grants Earned |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Government       | 6                 | 1,328         | £ 1,613 17 6 |
| Wesleyan         | 53                | 4,985         | 743 6 0    |
| Roman Catholic   | 16                | 2,039         | 1,043 7 6  |
| Basel Mission    | 40                | 2,853         |             |
| Total            | 115               | 11,205        | 3,400 11 0  |

In addition there are about 100 more schools which do not as yet receive Government support.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling, with Spanish, American, and French gold coins, as fixed by Ordinance No. 2 of 1880. Gold dust was demonetized by Ordinance No. 9 of 1889, but still remains a medium of exchange in the districts of the interior. A number of United States silver half-dollars are in circulation, but are not legal tender. German gold and silver coins circulate in the Trans-Volta districts since the Customs Union. Bronze coins are little used, owing to the dislike to them entertained by the natives. Cowries are still in use, but only for the purchase of articles of little value. Accounts are kept in sterling. The Bank of British West Africa have an establishment at Accra. It commenced business on the 1st January, 1897. In March, 1888, a Government savings bank was established, and had on the 31st December, 1896, a credit of 5,668l. 17s. 6d., in the names of 411 depositors. Penny Banks have also been established in the principal schools. The rate of exchange is at par.

Population.

The census returns for 1891 give the population of the Colony and protected territories as 768,882, exclusive of the countries of Kwahu and British Krepé, but the census committee estimate that owing to the great difficulty in getting at the people in the interior parts of the Colony, and to the great reluctance on the part of the natives to be enumerated, an addition of 205,000 should be made to the returns. The estimated population of Kwahu and British Krepé is 500,000, making the probable total population 1,473,882. The chief towns are, Accra (16,277); Cape Coast (11,614); Elmina (10,550); Kwitta, Saltpond, Winneba, Axim, and Ada.

Trade and Industry.

The staple products of the territories are palm oil, palm kernels, and rubber. The palm does not grow near the coast, and the produce is brought down on the heads of carriers from an area extending forty miles inland, and by canoe down the Volta River from a greater distance. Gold is found in many parts, notably in the Wassaw district, in the north-west of which Tarkwa and Prestea are centres. Unsuccessful management, the distance of four of the mines from the nearest port (Axim), and the lack of a good road, have proved obstacles to
successful mining on a large scale in the past, but much greater energy has been exhibited in mining enterprise since the year 1889, four companies with established plant and staff having been actively at work, and gold to the value of £6,999/., was raised and exported in 1893. Steps are now being taken with a view to the construction of a railway from the coast at Takoradi Bay to the Tarquah district, from which in 1896 gold valued at £33,657/., was exported. Indiarubber abounds in the interior forests, and is rapidly becoming an important export. Cotton grows wild, but is not cultivated. Small quantities of coffee and ground nuts are grown, and the exports also include monkey skins, kola nuts, ivory, copra, guinea grains; gum, copal, camwood, and beniseed. An export of valuable native woods opened about two years ago promises to be an industry which will largely increase the export trade of the Colony. The quantities and values of the principal exports in 1896 were:

| Value       | Year |
|-------------|------|
| Cola nuts   | 3,156 pkgs. 33,278 |
| Dye stuffs and substances used in tanning | 64,496 lbs. 996 |
| Gold dust   | 23,940 oz. 10 ack. 21 tak. 86,186 |
| Guinea grain | 26,594 lbs. 194 |
| Gum copal   | 14,194 lbs. 226 |
| Ivory       | 6,931 lbs. 1,994 |
| Monkey skins and furs of all sorts | 67,722 nos. 8,666 |
| Palm kernels and other nuts for pressing oil therefrom | 13,236 tons 86,293 |
| Palm oil    | 2,394,563 galls. 126,857 |
| Rubber      | 3,735,439 lbs. 313,817 |
| Timber      | 6,063,339 ft. 52,233 |

The trade with Salagha and Ashanti has hitherto been slight, owing to the difficulties of communication and the frequent native wars. Fishing is extensively carried on. There are but few manufactures, and these on the smallest scale. Native cloth is woven, fish is salted and cured, bricks are made, and simple boats built. Gold is worked into native ornaments with some skill. The chief imports are textiles, alcohol, hardware, and coaperage. More than three-quarters of the total trade is with the United Kingdom, the rest being with the United States, Germany, Holland, and France.

In April, 1890, a Botanical Station was established at Aburi, where the Government Sanatorium is situated, at an elevation of 1,400 feet above the sea, and a curator from the Royal Gardens, Kew, appointed, the objects in view being to teach the natives the most approved methods of planting, to introduce fresh seed and trees from other tropical countries, and to develop the agricultural resources of the colony and increase the number of its economic exports generally. At present there are some 44 acres planted with cocoa, coffee, cotton, tobacco, jute, spices, eucalypti, and various fruit trees and other plants. These young plants will be for sale to European and native planters and chiefs, and it is intended to apprentice boys from the schools of the colony to the gardening work and ultimately to assist them to start fresh centres in other parts of the colony. A sample of cotton sent home from Christiansborg in December, 1892, was of better quality and obtained a higher price than the average West African cotton. A coffee plantation of the Liberian variety has been established about twelve miles from Cape Coast by a European firm, and promises well.
