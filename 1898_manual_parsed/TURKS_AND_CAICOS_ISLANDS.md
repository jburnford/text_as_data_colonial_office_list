TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.
The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is 169 square miles, about the size of Rutland. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 63 miles long and 2 miles broad. It contains 1,883 inhabitants, being three-eighths the total population. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.
Grand Turk claims, like so many other islands, to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salttraders from Bermudas. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

Industries.
Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered being about 2,000,000 bushels. The export of salt in 1896 was valued at 29,107l., the quantity being 1,904,627 bushels. Sponges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There is one sponge curing establishment on the Caicos Islands. The cultivation of the Sisal fibre (or Pita plant) has been introduced, and has a fair prospect of success. Cave earth is also an article of export.

An agricultural settlement was started under Government auspices at Kew, North Caicos in 1882, to grow fruit for export, but proved a failure, owing to the absence of any remunerative market for the produce. The soil elsewhere is totally unfit for agricultural purposes. Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. The commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had on the 31st December, 1896, 43 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 5,057 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.
The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the strong and never failing sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 82°, the extreme range being from 65° to 92°. The rainfall during 1896 amounted to 21 inches, the rainy season being from October to February. Hurricanes occasionally visit the groups.

Means of Communication.
Messrs. Pickford and Black's steamers, running under Government contract, leave Halifax for Jamaica on the 15th of every month, calling at Turks Islands both going and returning. The length of voyage between England and Turks is fourteen days via New York, and eighteen days via Halifax or Jamaica.

The Clyde Line from New York to Hayti calls at Grand Turk every three weeks, the length of passage being six days. There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony.

The estimated number of letters to the United Kingdom is 3,000, and to all other countries 12,000 per annum.

The rate of letter postage is 2½d. per half ounce. There is no internal post.

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti, distant 165 miles.

Education.
There are seven elementary schools supported by Government, with an attendance in 1896 of 730 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free. A compulsory education ordinance, providing also for the payment of fees, was passed in 1883, but the compulsory clauses have never been proclaimed.

Currency and Banking.
The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, Spanish, Mexican, and Columbian gold doubloons, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is no paper currency. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1895, 163 depositors, with £2,707 deposit.

Constitution.
The legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure, and all local matters, are regulated by this Board, but laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express
terms made applicable to Turks Islands, take effect there.

The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, and the custody of lunatics have been so dealt with,
