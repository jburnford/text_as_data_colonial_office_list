Natal.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between 29th and 31st parallels of S. lat.: it is bounded by the Tugela and Umntamvuna Rivers, and by the Drakensberg Mountains. It comprises an area of about 20,851 square miles (being over one-third of England and Wales), and has a seaboard of one hundred and seventy miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 23 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the one hundred and seventy miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of 20,155; the largest town and only port is Durban, with 31,877 inhabitants, of whom half are Natives and Indians.

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1886, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonize it. Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Chaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with various success; but in 1829 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

Zululand was incorporated with Natal in 1897.

Constitution.

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1841, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act, of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first ministry was appointed.

The ministers are: the Colonial Secretary, who is also Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, the Attorney-General, who is also Minister of Education, the Minister of Lands and Works, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and the Treasurer, all of whom must hold seats in either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, but not more than two may be members of the Legislative Council.

In place of the Legislative Council as previously existing, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly are constituted.

The Legislative Council, consisting of eleven Members, is, in the case of the first council, sum-

moned by the Governor, and thereafter from time to time by the Governor in Council. The Members are summoned from the following districts of the Colony:—Five from within the counties of Durban, Victoria, Alexandra, and Alfred; three from within the counties of Pietermaritzburg and Umvoti, and three from within the counties of Weenen and Klip River; but not more than two Members may be chosen from within any one county.

Each Member holds his seat for ten years from the date of his summons, but five of the Members first summoned vacate their seats at the end of five years.

No person may be summoned as a Member of the Legislative Council unless he be the registered proprietor of immovable property within the Colony of the value of £500 in net value.

The Legislative Assembly is an elective body, and consists of 37 Members who must be duly qualified and registered electors chosen by the electors of the several electoral districts, of which there are 13 in the Colony.

The duration of the Legislative Assembly is limited to four years from the date of the return of the writs of election, but the Governor may dissolve the Assembly whenever he may think fit.

The laws relating to the mode of election, the qualifications of electors, and to all other matters concerning elections, in force at the time of the passing of the Act, apply to the election of Members to serve in the Legislative Assembly.

The reserved Civil List attached to the Act includes £2,900 for pensions to officers retired on account of the change in the Constitution, and also £8,200 for the salaries of the Governor and Ministers, £600 for an Under Secretary for Native Affairs, and £10,000 for the promotion of the welfare and education of the natives.

Members are not paid, but those residing more than two miles from the Seat of Government receive 1l. per day travelling allowance. The session is usually from April to June.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or is in receipt of rents from property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month, is entitled to a vote.

Local Government.

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, and Newcastle, and local boards in Ladysmith, Vernam, Greytown, and Dundee. Their total revenue in 1896 was 298,435l., their expenditure, 190,287l., and their debt 683,825l.

Native Affairs.

In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amalubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalelo and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his son were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crimes mala in se. The native population was debarred from the franchise, but by an Act No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law, in which case he was entitled to all the rights of an ordinary colonist.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the Chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895 the Native High Court and the Court established by law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these Courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. A white magistrate is placed with every tribe, who is the administrator of justice in civil matters, and supersedes to a considerable extent the authority of the Chiefs. The tribes live apart, upon locations provided for them by the Government. But besides these location natives there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms. By law No. 13 of 1875 a tax of 5l. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under law 41, 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut is imposed upon natives living on Crown lands.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is 2,200,000 acres, besides about 150,000 acres held by religious missions. The number of natives living on these lands was estimated in 1885 at 169,800, there being at the same date about 162,600 on private lands as tenants, and 42,000 on Crown lands as squatters.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies, but is usually mild, cool, and bright. On the coast it is semi-tropical. The mean temperature at Pietermaritzburg is 65°, and at Durban 69°. The rainfall at the coast is about 40 inches, and less inland. The rainy season is from October to March inclusive, during which thunderstorms are frequent and severe.

More than four-fifths of the inhabitants are Zulu Kaffirs, and about 7 per cent. are Indian Coolies. The Europeans nearly all speak English, but many of them are of Dutch descent, with some Germans and Norwegians.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly mail service with England (voyage from England to Natal, 24 days 12 hours, and from Natal to England daily 24 days 4 hours; services with Cape daily; with Mauritius and East Coast Ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, &c.) once or twice a month; with Delagoa Bay six times a month or more frequently; with Australia fortnightly; and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the South African Republic, the Orange Free
State, the Cape, Zululand, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the world generally.

The rates of postage are:

| Internal and Cape | Letters, ½ oz. Newspapers. |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Orange Free State, and Transvaal | 1d. ½d. per 4 oz. |
| Most other countries | 2½ per 2 oz. |

There are 794½ miles of Government telegraphs constructed at a cost of £96,351.10s. 9½d., and the earnings for the year ended 1896, were £32,782.2s. 6½d. (cash receipts, £24,815.17s. 9½d., and value of Government messages, £7,966.4s. 9½d.) and the expenses, £19,281.2s. 6½d.

There are 420½ miles of railway open, all constructed and worked by the Government, with the exception of the Dundee branch (7½ miles in length) which was constructed by the Dundee (Natal) Coal Company, but is worked by the Government, and will ultimately be absorbed into the Natal Government railway system.

The main line extends from the Port of Durban to Pietermaritzburg (the capital of the Colony, 70 miles inland), and from thence to Charlestown, on the border of the South African Republic (30½ miles distant from the port), where it connects with the Netherlands South African Company's line to Johannesburg and Pretoria. A branch line extends northwards from Durban to Verulam, 1¾ miles, and another from South Coast Junction to Umkomaas 25 miles. The work was begun in January, 1876, and the sections then authorised were completed in November, 1880. Two subsequent extensions of 119 and 114 miles respectively were sanctioned, and the last, which completes the main line to Charlestown, on the border of the South African Republic, was opened for passenger traffic on 7th April, 1891, and for goods traffic on 1st August, 1891. Connection with Johannesburg and Pretoria was opened at the close of 1895. A branch to Harrismith, in the Orange Free State, from the main line at the 190¼ mile post, was opened for traffic on 14th July, 1892, with a mileage of 59½ miles, 23½ of which run through the Orange Free State.

The total cost of construction of the railways up to the end of 1896, was £6,236,553½. The receipts for 1896, were £1,136,213½, and the expenditure £421,989½. The net receipts were equal to 11½. 0s. 9½d. per cent. upon the capital expended upon open lines.

Defence.

There is a garrison of about 1,500 Imperial troops quartered at Pietermaritzburg.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of Dec., 1896, consisted of 1,391 of all ranks. This includes a volunteer naval force of 90 men.

There is also an armed and mounted police force, numbering 488 Europeans. The port of Durban is strongly fortified by a battery on the Bluff and one at the Back Beach armed with heavy guns.

Industry.

The chief exports are wool, sugar, tea hides, gold, coal, maize, hair, wattle bark, and ostrich feathers.

There is a large transit trade with the Orange Free State, and the South African Republic. The harbour of Durban, which has a somewhat dangerous bar, has been much improved by the works of the Harbour Department, and by dredging. It is a port of registry, having, in 1896, 27 vessels, with a total tonnage of 5,444 tons. The main industry of the Colony is, however, agriculture; large numbers of cattle and sheep being reared, and large crops of maize and sugar raised. There are several mines of coal, those at Dundee, Eland's Laagte, and Newcastle supplying the Government railways.

The area under sugar is about 19,415 acres, the produce for the year, 1896, being about 20,000 tons; that under coffee about 322 acres, yielding about 30,000 lbs. Tea, tobacco, arrowroot, and cayenne pepper are also grown. The area under tea in 1896 was 2,302 acres, yielding 739,100 lbs., and the area cultivated by natives was 583,925 acres.

The stock owned by Europeans was as follows: Horses, 28,088; mules, 1,791; cattle (horned) 242,165; sheep, 786,796; Angora goats, 62,878; pigs, 14,278; donkeys, 576. The stock owned by natives was as follows: Horses, 22,372; cattle (horned), 494,402; sheep, 20,595; goats, 308,309; pigs, 29,462.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South Africa, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, and the National Bank of the South African Republic have together sixteen establishments, with 2,729,767½ deposits. A Government savings bank was established in 1868, and had in 1896 (Dec. 31st), 223,415½ deposits.

Education.

There are 23 Government schools, 68 aided denominational and other schools, and 229 farm-house schools. The aggregate number of pupils in regular attendance at the Government and inspected schools was 8,180 (1896). The management is vested in the Minister of Education, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is not compulsory. There are government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. There are also 145 native schools receiving Government aid, with an attendance of 7,048, and 28 Indian schools, all of which are aided, with an attendance of 1,842. Total children on rolls, 17,071.
