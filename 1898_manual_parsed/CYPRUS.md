CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

It has been now systematically surveyed, and its area is 3,584 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Mesaoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the English troops, and of the High Commissioner who administers the Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

History.

Cyprus was colonized by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too long and eventful to be here related even in outline. When the Roman Empire was divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and was governed by lieutenants of the Byzantine Emperors until 1191, when Richard I of England occupied the island to chastise the ruler, Isaac Comnenus, for the ill-treatment of the English fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could not govern it, the king made it over to Guy de Lusignan, who claimed to be King of Jerusalem, and undertook the obligations of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 until 1489, when Queen Catarina Cornaro, herself a Venetian and widow of James II, having survived her husband and his posthumous son, James III, yielded the government of the island to the Republic of Venice. Venice ruled the island until 1570-71, when the Ottoman Turks invaded it, and captured and put to the sword the Venetian garrisons.

The island remained under the government of the Sultans of Constantinople from 1571 until 1878, with the exception of the period from 1832 to 1840, when it was held by the Pasha of Egypt, then at war with the Porte. It may be observed that the island was frequently invaded by the Arabs, Saracens, and Egyptians before its final conquest by the Turks, and that from 1425 to 1571, it paid tribute to Egypt. The great fortress and port of Famagusta was held by the Genoese Republic from 1373 until 1464, when the Lusignan king, James II, retook it with the help of the Egyptians.

Climate.

The mean temperature is about 69° Fah.; mean maximum 78°; mean minimum 57°. Highest shade temperature during last ten years 116°; lowest 22°. Average rainfall for last ten years 19-16 inches. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. There has been no drought since 1887. The island may be said to be, in every way, healthy. Malarial fevers exist, but they are not of a severe type.

Population.

The population of the several districts, excluding the military, at the censuses taken in 1881 and 1891, was:

| District   | 1881 | 1891 |
|------------|------|------|
| Nicosia    | 61,695 | 56,812 |
| Famagusta  | 41,423 | 38,207 |
| Larnaca    | 23,760 | 20,766 |
| Limassol   | 35,730 | 29,248 |
| Papho      | 31,674 | 28,424 |
| Kyrenia    | 15,004 | 13,216 |

Total | 209,286 | 186,173 |

This shows an increase during the decade of 23,113.
The Moslems form about 23 per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Orthodox Greek Church.

**Towns.**

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 12,515 (11,536 in 1881) inhabitants; Larnaca, 7,593 (7,838 in 1881); Limassol, 7,388 (6,006 in 1881). The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour; but at present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has only 763 (658 in 1881) inhabitants, nearly all Moslems. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 2,488 (1,906 in 1881) nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktima, the modern capital of Papho, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, where a small harbour has recently been constructed in the district of the same name, on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karanouia.

**Industry.**

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but with the exception of a concession granted in 1886, and since abandoned, they have not been worked in recent times. Gypsum is exported in a raw state from the Carpas and from Larnaca, mostly to Syria, and manufactured, i.e., in the form of plaster of Paris from Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from these two places it is mostly sent to Egypt. The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, carobs, wine and spirits, cotton, linseed, aniseed, silk, cheese, wool, fruit, and vegetables; cattle, mules and donkeys are also exported in some numbers.

The carobs and cereals are exported mainly to the United Kingdom, France, and Egypt.

Cyprus wine is somewhat heady for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it acquires from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins. This practice has for some time been discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables the wine to be conveyed in barrels.

Both wine and spirits have, since the extra duty was imposed in France, found a fairly good demand in Egypt and in other parts of the Turkish Empire.

Since the year 1883, when direct and regular communication with Egypt terminated, the production of fruit and vegetables, for which the island is well adapted, has not developed, but now that direct communication has again been secured considerable progress in this industry is anticipated. The direct communication with Egypt has given a great impetus to the export of the surplus oxen, sheep, and other animals.

The agriculture has been greatly retarded by want of water, the rainfall being deficient, and much of what does fall being allowed to run to waste. A scheme, however, for storing water for irrigation is now being carried out under the superintendence of an engineer sent by the Government of India.

In past years much injury was done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, are stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts are then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as they are topped with a zinc lining, they cannot emerge. This system, as the locusts are now more scattered, has been experimentally discarded in favour of a system of collecting live locusts and locust eggs.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the large number of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains more than any other country, and partly in consequence of the many forest fires that occur through the summer months.

Sponge fishing has been extensively carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek islands. By a law passed in 1890 power is given to the High Commissioner to grant exclusive privileges for fishing the coasts for sponges, but the law has not yet been taken advantage of. The value of the fishing may be put at from 20,000l. to 30,000l. a year.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected, and it is difficult to obtain fish all the year round except at the seaport towns.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, linseed, aniseed, olive oil, silk, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, gypsum, and terra umbra.

**Currency and Banking.**

Under an Order in Council which came into operation on the 1st August, 1882, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign, half-sovereign, Turkish lira, and French 20-franc piece. Silver, the florin, shilling, sixpence, and three-pence, limit of tender 3l. Bronze, the piastre (nine equal to one shilling), half piastre; quarter piastre; limit of tender, 27 piastres.

The Imperial Ottoman Bank has branches established at Larnaca, Nicosia, and Limassol.

There is as yet no Government savings bank.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oke = 2-8 lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum = about ¼ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

**Means of Communication.**

There is no railway or navigable waterway in the island, but roads between all important places are now maintained. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration work about 240 miles of land line in connection with their cables. The island is in direct telegraphic communication with Alexandria and Latakia (Syria), by means of the cables of the Eastern and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Companies respectively.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Alexandria, and Smyrna and Constantinople by the "Austrian Lloyd," "Messageries Maritimes." A weekly service is at present maintained with Egypt by the Bell's Company. There are also frequent direct steamers to and from Egypt and the adjacent coast of Syria.

The rates of postage are as follows:

- Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers.
- Within the island c. p. ½ c. p. per 2 ozs.
- England 3½ d.
The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the island.

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of elementary schools was established in 1882.

There are about 200 elementary schools in connection with the Greek Orthodox church, which receive aid amounting to about 2,610l. And there are about 70 elementary Moslem schools, which receive aid amounting to about 730l.

An Armenian boys school and an Armenian girls' school in Nicosia and a Maronite school in the village of Kormabibi, are also aided by Government.

A Rushdie or Moslem high school is maintained entirely by the Government at a cost of about 200l. a year; and a grant of 200l. a year is given to the Greek gymnasium at Nicosia, which provides the required training for teachers of Greek Christian elementary schools.

There is also a Greek high school at Larnaca, and another at Limassol, which are not aided by Government.

In accordance with a law passed in 1895, Boards of Education have recently been established, one to regulate the Moslem schools and another to regulate the Greek Christian schools. There is also in each district a District Committee for Moslem schools, and a District Committee for Greek Christian schools, presided over in each case by the Commissioner of the district.

The total enrolment is about 14,000; 3,500 Moslems and 10,500 Christians.

Leprosy.

Prior to the British occupation, limited provision was made for lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was originally founded by the dragoman to the Turkish governor early in the century.

The asylum has been greatly improved, several new houses of an improved class having been erected, and the accommodation thus largely increased. The welfare of the inmates has been a matter of considerable attention, and a very nice recreation room was given to them by the late High Commissioner, Sir H. E. Bulwer, which has greatly enhanced the comfort of these poor people.

Also a church has been erected by voluntary subscriptions.

There is now accommodation for over 100 inmates, and the enclosed farm of 200 donums is partly cultivated by the lepers, the produce being all used on the farm. Each person receives bread, clothing, and fuel, and a government allowance of 2½ copper piastres daily.

No leper quits the farm except on very rare occasions, and then only on urgent business and with the permission of the Chief Medical Officer.

The total number of lepers in the island, as returned by the census of 1891, was 107—76 males and 31 females. On 31st March, 1895, there were 93 inmates of the leper farm.

The disease shows itself in two principal forms, the tubercular, and the anaesthetic; of the latter there is a notable sub-group, elephantiasis mutilosus, in which spontaneous amputation of fingers, toes, and even whole members occur. In the other form the skin and mucous membranes are the parts chiefly affected, especially the face and head. This form is more common, more dreadful in its effects, and more rapid in its termination; but neither of the two can be called a fatal disease, as their average duration is 10-20 years, and some lepers live to be quite old people.

Leprosy is slightly more common in this island among males than females; the greater proportion of cases come from low-lying villages in the districts of Famagusta, and cases among Mussulmans are of the greatest rarity. The promulgation of the disease has been proved beyond doubt to be due to contagion, stimulated by unclean habits, bad food, and, in a way, malarial cachexy, although undoubtedly the predisposition to the disease is very often hereditary.

A law was passed in 1891 to better regulate the segregation and treatment of lepers, and a Superintendent has been appointed, who resides in the asylum, to enforce discipline and superintend the conduct of the lepers.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:

"I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkemé-i-Shérîh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

"II. That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands let or sold during that period.*

"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazi Miriyé ve Emliki Houmayouni), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

"V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

"VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government.

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of £6,000 a year.
of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to legislation has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:—

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment and fine of £l.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to £l.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the Court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkemé-i-Shéríeh, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadias, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:—

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—

(1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.

(2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.

(3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males between 18 and 60 years of age.

3. Tithes of the following products of the island:—

Cereals—taken in kind.

Olives—value assessed and recovered in money.

Carobs and silk cocoons—taken on export.

Export duties—equivalent to 10 per cent. ad valorem in lieu of tithes—are taken on export of cotton, linseed, aniseed, and raisins.

[The tithes of all other articles have been abolished, many in 1882, and sixteen in 1897.]

4. Sleep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (temporary) of ½ per cent. on tithes and certain incomes (for locust destruction).

9. Import duties.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike. All other export duties, and a fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

There is a military police force of about 670 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its mediæval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, of very ancient date, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum was started in 1888 by subscription.

THE NIGER TERRITORIES.

Situation and Boundaries.

These regions, estimated to cover about 500,000 square miles, and with a population estimated at 20,000,000 to 35,000,000, are secured to Great Britain by nearly 400 treaties made by the Royal Niger Company (formerly the National African Company, Limited), and recognized by the three Anglo-German Agreements of June, 1885, June, 1886, and November, 1893, and the Anglo-French Agreement of August, 1890. The agreements with Germany establish as an eastern frontier a line running from the Cross River to a little east of Yola, on the Upper Benue, and thence to a point on the south bank of Lake Chad 35 minutes east of the meridian of Kuka. The northern frontier of the Territories is settled by the agreement with France, and is to be a line drawn from Say, on the Middle Niger, to Baruna, on Lake Chad, but diverted so as to leave within the Niger Territories everything that properly belongs to the kingdom of Sokoto. Under this agreement the Company claims the Saharan provinces of Air, or Asben, and Danergu; but this claim is contested by France, and will have to be settled by the International Commission referred to in the agreement. The same commission will settle the western frontier between France and the Niger Territories in the great bend of the Niger to the west of Borgu, a powerful pagan kingdom which was, by a treaty dated the 26th January, 1890, brought within the jurisdiction of the Company. Borgu bounds on the north the kingdom of Dahomey, which France has lately conquered. The Territories are separated from the British colony of Lagos by that portion of Yorubaland which has not yet been conquered by the Mohammedans, nor brought within the jurisdiction of any European power. On the Gulf of Guinea the Territories occupy about 106 miles of coast line from the Forcados to the Brass River; the adjacent coast line on either side falling within the British Niger Coast Protectorate, administered by a British Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by a number of vice-consuls. During the early part of 1897 the Company had to send punitive expeditions against the Emir of Nupé, and the Emir of Ilorin. They were entirely successful, completely defeating both Emirs' forces. Bida, the capital of Nupé, was destroyed and Ilorin occupied.

Prior to this a march of nearly 200 miles, from Lokoji to Kabba and thence to Egbon, had cleared all Southern Nupé of the Foulah slave raiders, and on the 20th June, 1897, the legal status of slavery in the Niger Territories was declared abolished by the Company.
Administration.

The Niger Territories are governed from London by a Council, of which Sir George Goldie is Governor. The Company exercises its jurisdiction under a Royal Charter, dated 10th July, 1886, by which their sovereign rights in the territories over which they have treaties were recognized, and authorized to be exercised.

Order is maintained in the Territories by native allies, by the Company's fleet of twenty to thirty steamers, and by a small force of disciplined troops. These consist of English officers and about 1,000 Hausas, chiefly trained as artillery, but also armed with Snider rifles. There is also a civil police force in each district commanded by the local magistrates. The headquarters of the troops is at Lokoja, at the junction of the Niger and Benue rivers. The capital, where are the supreme court, central gaol, main hospital, and other public institutions, is at Asaba, about half way between Lokoja and Akassa, the mouth of the Niger, on the Gulf of Guinea, which is the transhipping depot, and where are the repairing yards and engineers' works for the fleet of river steamers. A patent slipway—the first in West Africa—has lately been erected at Akassa for the repair of these. The other principal settlements are at Abo, Abutshi, Atani, Bakundi, Donga, Egga, Ibi, Idah, Leaba, Loko, Odeni, and Yola, the latter being about 200 miles south of Lake Chad.

Climate and Products.

The lower portion of the Territories in the Niger delta has a bad reputation for its climate. In this region are produced the palm oil and palm kernels which form a large portion of the exports from the Territories.

The regions further inland are stated to be much healthier, while their principal products are rubber, hides, ground nuts, shea butter, ivory, chillies, and various drugs.

The chief imports are cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, powder, salt, silks, spirits, and woollen goods. The Company have prohibited the importation of rifles, breech loading guns, cartridges, &c., into any part of the Territories. They have also prohibited the importation of spirits into the upper portions of their territories, and put heavy duties on their introduction into the lower portions, so that the importation of spirits is now less than one-fourth of what it was before the charter. There are no import duties excepting on guns, powder, salt, spirits, and tobacco. The revenue is chiefly raised by export duties.

Means of Communication.

There are telegraph stations at Brass and Bonny, in cable communication with Lagos, and thus with Europe. Regular steamers arrive and depart from Liverpool and the West Coast of Africa every three weeks. Communication in the Niger basin is mainly by the steamers of the Royal Niger Company.
