AMATONGALAND.

Situation and Area.

By Government Notice dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Amatongaland, also called Amaputaland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the North by Portuguese Possessions, on the West and South by Zululand, and on the East by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongola with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and is now (1897) being laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments. The population is estimated at 4,000.

History.

The Amatonga are an independent tribe which has been ruled for years by a Paramount Chief under a form of vassalage to the Zulu Kings. Owing, probably, to the unhealthiness of the country the Amatonga do not possess the fine physique of the Zulu race.

Administration.

By a Proclamation issued on the 17th September, 1896, by the Governor of Zululand as special commissioner for Amatongaland, under an Order in Council dated the 29th June, 1896, provision was made for the administration of Amatongaland. The Laws of Zululand therein declared to be in force within the Protectorate so far as applicable and as circumstances may admit, have been administered by a Deputy Commissioner invested with the same powers and jurisdiction as are exercised by Magistrates in Zululand. By Proclamation of the 22nd of November, 1897, the Protectorate of Amatongaland was declared to be part of the Queen's dominions, and was annexed on the 27th of December to Zululand, which was itself annexed to Natal on the 30th of December. Amatongaland is, therefore, now part of Natal.

Communication.

Postal communication is maintained between Zululand and Amatongaland via the Ubonbo Magistracy twice a week by native mail-carriers. Supplies are drawn either from Delagoa Bay up the Maputa river by barge and thence by wagon, or by the main road over-land from Eshowe the seat of Government in Zululand.
