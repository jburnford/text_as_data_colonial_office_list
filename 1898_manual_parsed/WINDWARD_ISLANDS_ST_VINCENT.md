ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.
The Island of St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 85,000 acres of land, about half the area of Middlesex, of which only about 13,000 acres
is in cultivation. Some of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from St. Vincent.

**General Description.**

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of about 4,547 souls. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1896, 36 vessels, of 649 tons.

St. Vincent, though exhibiting some features in common with the other islands, is favourably distinguished from many of them by an undulating surface, and a succession of gentle slopes, of which portions are cultivated for sugar-cane. Its most striking peculiarity is its "Soufrière," or volcanic mountain, celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and is about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded mountain traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. The next highest peak in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond river.

**Climate.**

In the dry season, December to June, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy, and fever is almost unknown. The nights are cool all the year round. The average rainfall for last 6 years is 115 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during 1896 was 87° and the lowest 66°, the average mean temperature being 79° in the shade. The prevailing wind is N.E.

**Industry and Communications.**

Sugar, rum, cocoa, spices, and excellent arrow-root are produced. The cultivation of ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention. Most of the sugar and all the arrowroot mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivated land is owned by one firm; large tracts of Crown lands, which hitherto remained uncultivated are now in process of alienation to peasant proprietors. The forests produce excellent woods. There are 77 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne.

The principal towns are Kingstown, the capital, at the foot of Mount St. Andrew; Georgetown, in the Carib Country; and Chateaubelair, at the north-western end of the island.

A telephone system has been established, having one central and 7 branch exchanges, with 90 connections and about 142 miles of line.

**History.**

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands. The Caribs continued sole masters of St. Vincent until the year 1675, when a number of savages of a different race were discovered in it. These received the appellation of "Black Caribs," to distinguish them from the aborigines, to whom the name of "Yellow Caribs" was given.

In 1722 George I made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 890, and the slaves to 3,006, producing commodities for exportation to the value of 63,625l.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but then the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overrun the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British head-quarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Rattan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400 and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.
St. Vincent received its first cargo of Coolie labourers in 1861. The indentures of these immigrants have expired, and most of them have returned to India. About 330 (including children born at St. Vincent) have made their home in the Colony.

**Constitution.**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony; and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three *ex officio*, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. By an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, the Legislative Council now consists of four official and four nominated unofficial members.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is the sole Judge of this court.

There are two Government schools, 20 Anglican, 19 Wesleyan, and 4 Roman Catholic schools, with 6,502 children on the rolls, and an average attendance of 3,667. There is also a grammar school (for boys and girls), which receives a grant of £100 per annum from the Government for boys, and a capitation grant for girls, amounting in 1896 to £20. 6s. 8d.

The Government expenditure on education in 1896, including grant to grammar school, and salary, &c., of inspector was £2,179.

A savings bank was established in 1866, and had 1,062 depositors, with £4,553 deposited at 31st December, 1896.
