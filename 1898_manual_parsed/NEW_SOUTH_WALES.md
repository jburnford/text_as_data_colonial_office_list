NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.

The Colony of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 153rd meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the Colony of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the Colony follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three Colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the Colony is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the Colony follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary, the Dumaesg; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dumaesg. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence, almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area comprised within these limits is estimated at 310,700 square miles, or 198,848,000 acres, being a little over two and a-half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area would be 135,882,150 acres, or about 396,066 square miles.

The length of the Colony, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 680 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 760 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 850 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' 41" S. lat., and 151° 12' 42" 15" E. long.

Of the total area of the Colony, 45,257,468 acres have been alienated, or are in the process of alienation.

History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, and gave it the name of New South Wales, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, when the convict station (intended for Botany Bay) was established at Port Jackson under Captain Phillip, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The population in 1800 was 4,958. The Merino sheep was introduced in 1797. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until
1813. Moreton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 36,598. Convicts ceased to arrive in 1841. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean in shade in 1896 was 36°2, to Bourke and Lismore, where it was 68°9 and 69°6 respectively. On the coast it varied from 60°6 at Eden to 69°6 at Lismore, Sydney being 63°1, almost the same as Barcelona. On the mountains snow lies in some places all the winter. At Bathurst the mean temperature was 58°, and on the inland plains about 64°7.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The total fall during 1896 at Sydney was 42°40 inches; and the days on which rain fell 152. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while Sydney in 152 days has 42°40 inches. Fifty years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The export of wool the produce of the Colony during the past ten years has been as follows:—

The coal mines have steadily advanced since 1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is given as 433,889 tons, valued at 236,230; while in 1881, 1,775,224 tons, valued at 603,248, were raised from 40 mines; and in 1896, 3,909,517 tons, valued at 1,125,281, were raised from 93 mines.

Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry. 50 vessels, of a total tonnage of 8,202, were registered during the year 1896, while the total number of vessels on the registers at the close of 1896 was 965, with a tonnage of 112,668.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at which gold was received for coining during 1896 to the extent of 2,610,459.

The average note circulation for the same period was 1,237,971.

The New South Wales Savings Bank, established 1832, had, at the close of 1896, 73,222 depositors, with 4,149,658 deposited. Interest is allowed at the rate of 4l. per cent. per annum on deposits up to 200l. on accounts remaining open at end of year, on accounts closed during the year the rate is 3l. per cent. per annum. When deposits made by any one individual exceed the sum of 200l. no interest is allowed on such excess, but this regulation does not apply to the deposits of Penny Savings Banks, Charitable Institutions, and Friendly Societies.

Means of Communication.

There are 44,283 miles of Government roads, 9,533 of which are metalled and gravelled or ballasted. In addition there are 2,772 bridges of 20 feet span and over, comprising 7,655 spans, covering a length of 260,519 feet; 31,073 culverts (under 20 feet span), = 461,578 feet, and 14,816 causeways, = 345,785 feet. There are also 98 punts, 4 horse boats, 1 steam launch, 86 flood boats, 111 other boats and 9 punt slips belonging to the Department. There are 2,639 miles of railways, owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been £37,369,205l. The receipts during the year ended 30th June, 1897, were £3,014,742l., and the working expenses £1,601,218l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being £1,413,524l. There are also 84 miles of private railway, which cost £558,187l. to construct. There are 62½ miles of Government tramways, earning £306,695l., against working expenses amounting to £248,881l. The total capital expenditure on tramways, £1,452,670l.

Of telegraphs there are 12,418 miles open, with 30,820 miles of wire, with 856 stations. The cost of construction was £889,476l., and the revenue received during 1896, £159,741l.

Nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, and the Hunter, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Port Said), the Orient lines (via Colombo and Naples), and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Mauritius and Marseilles), Union Company (via San Francisco), Canadian Australian line (via Vancouver), North German Lloyd (via Colombo and Port Said). Seven mails per month are sent to and received from England.

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Education Act of 1880. Teachers are recognised as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The school fee is 3½d. per week per child, and the fees collected are paid into the Treasury as revenue. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

In 1896, there were 2,574 State schools divided into 2,785 departments in operation, namely, 5 high schools, 2 for boys and 3 for girls, 1,698 public schools, 310 provisional schools, 497 half-time schools, 44 house-to-house schools under itinerant teachers, and 20 evening public schools. The Colony has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction is imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective churches. For the year 1896 the net cost to the State of public instruction was about £576,441l. In 1896, 221,603 children attended the ordinary State schools, and 1,193 were inmates of the orphan schools, industrial schools, ragged schools, and the school for the deaf and dumb and the blind. In 1896, private schools, including church schools, showed a total enrolment of 53,967 and an average attendance of 43,069.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1852. Its State endowment was originally £5,000l., and from 1890 to 1892 was as high as £13,900l., but it has now been reduced to £9,000l. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The State endowment and special grants for 1896 amounted to £11,400l. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of £500l. per annum. In addition, there is the women's college, also affiliated, having a similar endowment. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and engineering. Recently, several faculties have been added to its curriculum. The number of students in 1896 was 454, and in addition 448 attended extension lectures. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, with an enrolment of 458 pupils, and having a State endowment of £1,500l. There is also a technical college, under the Department of Education, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns, the fees are within the reach of all, and the college is open to males and females alike. During 1896—162 classes were held, and 6,165 students attended; the Government advanced the sum of £17,364l. during the year. Public libraries and schools of arts are established throughout the colony. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, a Geographical, and an Art Society, a government observatory, with many other educational associations of a like character. The year's expenditure for the Public Library of New South...
Wales was £6,970; for the Museum, £5,894; and for the National Art Gallery £3,135.

The total State grant available for 1896-7 for educational purposes was about £755,680.

**Defence.**

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, George and Bradley's Heads, also at Newcastle and Botany, and along the coast.

The Military Forces consist of:—Permanent Troops, Head Quarter Staff, 56; General Staff, 10; Permanent Staff, 81; Artillery, 431; Engineers (Submarine Miners), 26; Army Service Corps, 6; Medical Staff Corps, 11. Partially Paid Troops.—Lancers, 381; Mounted Rifles, 355; Field Artillery, 146; Garrison Artillery, 469; Engineers, Field, 116; Engineers, Submarine Miners, 75; Engineers, Electricians, 77; Infantry—1st Regiment, 592; 2nd Regiment, 620; 3rd Regiment, 588; 4th Regiment, 622; Army Service Corps, 58; Medical Staff Corps Volunteers, 99; Infantry—5th Regiment (Scottish) Honorary, 188; Irish Rifles, Honorary, 176; St. George's Rifles, Honorary, 231; Chaplains, 15; Medical Officers Affiliated, 18; Strength of Rifle Clubs, 2,021. Total 7,468.

The Naval Forces are: a Naval Brigade, numbering 338, and 242 Naval Artillery Volunteers, both sections partially paid. The Naval Defence Force Staff, and the two Torpedo Boats, number 9 men. There is a total force (military and naval) of 8,048 of all ranks.

**Local Government.**

This is regulated mainly by Act No. 12 of 1887. Under this Act there have been established 182 boroughs and municipal districts, controlling property of the annual value of £7,072,190, and having a revenue in 1895-96 of £93,041, exclusive of loans, an expenditure of £84,183, and an outstanding debt of £2,585,235; but against this are accumulated sinking funds of £215,768.

The chief towns and their population will be found at p. 188.

**Constitution.**

The first legislative council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay.

The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council at present consists of 64 members, who are not paid, with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880" (44 Vict., No. 13), consisted of 141 members, representing 74 electoral districts; and provision was made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extended to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:—

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in District.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of £100, or of the annual value of £10, respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of £10, or who shall hold, and for the said 6 months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

A new Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1893, provided for the division of the Colony into 125 electorates, each represented by only one member. The new Act also abolished the property qualification and plural voting, and established the "one-man-one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalized subject, and who shall have resided in the Colony for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district for which he claims an elector's right, is qualified as an elector. Under this law the elections all take place on one and the same day. The first election under this Act took place on July 17th, 1894; and the second on July 24th, 1895. Under an amending Act passed in 1896, the franchise has been conferred on members of the police force, who are all in the employment of the State, and not controlled by local bodies.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Acts of 1858 and 1880, now repealed.

The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved. Under a law passed in 1889 members receive £300 per annum each.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long.), and is contiguous to the low archipelago (Tua- motu), which is under French protection. It was discovered by Cartaret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1789, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1873 these had increased to 76, and in 1879 to 90.
