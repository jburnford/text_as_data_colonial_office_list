CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustan, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 51' N. lat. and 79° 41' and 81° 54' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dundra Head, is 266 miles; its greatest width 140½ miles, from Colombo on the west coast, to Sangamankande on the east. Its area is 25,365 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldivé Archipelago, 500 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probable Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Eliu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is roughly estimated at about 30,000, the people being well governed, and energetic traders and seamen. Mali, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustan. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 75° to 80°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual rainfall is about 100 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November.

History.

The great Indian epic, the Ramayana, has a chapter describing Ceylon at least ten centuries before the Christian era, but the authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was
introduced 306 B.C., and from that date this faith has been preserved in comparative purity, exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

**Constitution.**

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Treasurer; and a Legislative Council of 17 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and eight nominated unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen, are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

**Defence.**

Imperial troops are stationed at Colombo, Kandy, and Trincomalee, and an annual contribution is paid to the Imperial Government for the cost of the European garrison, the strength being 1,582 men. The Colonial contribution for 1895 was Rs. 1,540,499. Trincomalee is a fortified Naval Station, and possesses an Admiralty dockyard. Colombo harbour is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of Dec., 1895, consisted of 1,157 of all ranks.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

The population of Ceylon was ascertained by the Census taken in 1881 to be 2,763,984, being an increase of 14·67 per cent. on the population of 1871. The present population is 3,008,466, according to the census of 1891, the details of which are as follows (including the military, shipping, and estates):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 763,187    |
| Central ditto             | 474,487    |
| Northern ditto            | 319,193    |
| Southern ditto            | 489,761    |
| Eastern ditto             | 148,727    |
| North-Western Province    | 320,032    |
| North-Central ditto       | 75,319     |
| Province of Uva           | 159,155    |
| Province of Sabaragamuna  | 258,605    |

Total 3,008,466

Among these are about 8,000 Europeans, 21,000 Burghers and Eurasians, 200,000 Moormen, 10,000 Malays, 2,000,000 Sinhalese, and three-quarters of a million Tamils. The Buddhists number more than half the population; there are about 600,000 Hindús, 200,000 Mohammedans, and 302,000 Christians. The population of the chief towns was as follows: Colombo, 126,926; Kandy, 20,252; Galle, 33,505; Trincomalee, 11,411; Jaffna, 43,092; Badulla, 5,548; Kurunegala, 4,676; Anuradhapura, 2,497.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea and coffee estates, &c., is about 200,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 250,000.

The area of the Colony is 25,365 square miles, or 16,233,600 acres; and rather more than one-fifth of this, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. About 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The most important products are:

| Product   | Acres |
|-----------|-------|
| Rice      | 589,077 |
| Other Grain | 138,663 |
| Coffee    | 22,475  |
| Tea       | 822,810 |
| Cinchona  | 4,336   |
| Coconuts  | 862,582 |
| Cinnamon  | 40,475  |
| Tobacco   | 11,067  |
| Cocoa     | 28,319  |

There are 299 plumbago mines in the island, giving an aggregate yield of over 23,000 tons of mineral every year, the value of which may be roughly estimated at over Rs. 3,353,000. There are 361 gem quarries.

The pearl fisheries, for which Ceylon is famous, are carried on on the banks which fringe the east coast. They have for many years been carried on by the Government itself.

The revenue derived from this source fluctuates considerably, as appears from the following statements:

- 1860, Rs. 375,120; 1874, Rs. 101,587; 1879, Rs. 84,567; 1880, Rs. 200,152; 1881, Rs. 539,533; 1881, Rs. 33,658; 1887, Rs. 400,766; 1888, Rs. 804,312; 1889, Rs. 499,201; 1890, Rs. 315,452.

The highest price realised by the sale of the pearl oysters was in 1860, the average being Rs. 129 per thousand. There was a very successful fishery in 1891, which realised Rs. 961,542, the largest revenue since 1814.

The upset price of Crown land is ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs duties, land sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Badulla, Ratnapura, and Kegalla, amounted in 1895 to 2,075,299 rupees, and their expenditure in the same year to 1,989,099 rupees.

The municipal debt on 31st December, 1896, was 275,102 rupees. Of this amount 209,024 rupees is the balance unpaid out of a loan of
250,900 rupees for the construction of water works at Kandy, and 66,078 rupees balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle in 1890 for the construction of water works.

The value of coffee exported in 1896 was 1,721,113 rupees; cinchona, rated at 73,585 rupees, and tea 49,290,530 rupees, respectively, were exported.

The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1886, 7,842,886 lbs.; 1888, 23,820,471 lbs.; 1890, 45,739,518 lbs.; 1892, 72,282,525 lbs.; 1893, 82,269,353 lbs.; 1894, 85,376,322 lbs.; 1895, 98,581,060 lbs.; and 1896, 110,095,193 lbs. The other exports are coconut oil, kernels, coir, copra, and desiccated coconut, cacao, cinnamon, cardamoms, citronella, oil, plumbago, and tobacco.

The exports are mainly to the United Kingdom, some going however to India, the United States, the Continent of Europe, and Australia. The imports are mainly rice from India, and textiles and coal from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever. In addition to these there are the Ganabawas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 26 of 1871, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1895 was 44,252, in schools aided by Government 90,229, and in unaided schools 35,353, making altogether a total of 169,834.

The total expenditure on account of the Educational Department was 632,819, as compared with 1868, when the number of scholars was 6,879, and the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government schools are all nonsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education, small fees are charged for English teaching.

The higher education of the Colony has since 1st January, 1885, been mainly left to local effort, as owing to retrenchment, the Department has been compelled to devote its funds mainly to the extension and development of primary education. The only High School entirely supported by Government is now the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-Aid High Schools. One Government scholarship of 150l. for 4 years, to be spent at an English University, is awarded annually.

There is one school of agriculture at Colombo which was opened at the beginning of 1884, and there are 10 branch institutions officered by young men trained in the Colombo School of Agriculture. Six of these men are paid by Government.

Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-Aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are ten. A central Technical Institute was founded in Colombo in 1893.

There is a Medical College, with a full staff of professors. The lectures are recognised by the examining bodies in Great Britain. There are two departments in the College, the Senior and the Junior. The former consists of students whose course of study extends over five years. A licence to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery is granted to each member of the Senior department who passes the prescribed examinations in the College. The members of the Junior department, after a training of three years, and after passing the prescribed examinations, are qualified to serve as medical practitioners, hospital assistants, dispensers and vaccinators. Female students were admitted from 1st May, 1892. There were 107 students attending during the session 1894-95, of whom 61 (57 males and 7 females) belonged to the Senior, and 43 (39 males and 4 females) to the Junior department.

The Government maintains 46 hospitals exclusive of those for infectious diseases and sick prisoners, two asylums, one for lunatics and the other for lepers, and 167 dispensaries, of which 46 are attached to hospitals, and 121 independent institutions. Besides these, there are 15 hospitals with dispensaries attached, and 29 independent dispensaries in the planting districts, to afford medical aid to 1,622 estates, scheduled to 32 districts, and 25 sub-districts. There is a government medical staff consisting of one principal civil medical officer and inspector-general of hospitals, 64 officers having British qualifications, of whom one is a lady, 52 having licences of the Ceylon Medical College, 90 medical assistants of local training, 115 dispensers and hospital assistants, 7 inspectors of vaccination, and 100 vaccinators, of whom 4 are females, distributed throughout the island. The cost of working the department amounted in 1895 to rs. 1,415,907-51, the sum of rs. 369,649-99 being on account of estate medical aid. The receipts, which include cost of maintenance of paying patients in hospitals, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, &c., amounted to rs. 188,319-88. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estate Branch of the Department yielded rs. 97,853-40.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is exclusively Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, which is alone legal tender. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pie. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in
1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue, of which the amount on the 31st December, 1895, was Rs. 10,165,000. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon. The Chartered Mercantile Bank had Rs. 4,355,600, the Madras Bank Rs. 6,882,828, and the National Bank Rs. 1,187,916 deposits in the island on 31st December, 1890. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank had 52 'lacs in deposit on 31st December, 1893.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1882, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885, and the two together had on 31st December, 1895, Rs. 4,168,937 deposited.

Public Works.

The Colombo South-West Breakwater was commenced in 1875, and was completed in 1885. A single arm composed of large concrete blocks on a rubble foundation running from the shore, a distance of 4,200 feet in a northerly direction, terminates with a slight curve.

In 1893 a Northern Arm, a North-West Breakwater, and the reclamation of 26 acres on the east side of the harbour were sanctioned, and work in connection with these commenced in May, 1894.

The Northern Arm to be a rubble embankment, 1,000 feet long, in a westerly direction with an entrance 700 feet wide between it and the North-West Breakwater.

The North-West breakwater to be similar in construction to the South-West breakwater, 2,670 feet long, in a south-westerly direction, with an entrance 800 feet wide between the breakwaters.

The total expenditure on the Harbour from 1873 to 31st December, 1895, Rs. 13,006,135-29.

Works have been constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo. The water is stored in a great reservoir at Labugama 25 miles distant from Colombo, and conveyed by piping to the service reservoir at Maligakanda, whence it is distributed through the town. The total cost of the scheme was Rs. 4,339,000.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—1,005 miles are open in Ceylon. There are 297 miles of railway, all owned and worked by the Government.

The lines of railway are distributed thus:—Colombo to Kandy (74 miles), Kandy and Matale (174 miles), Peradeniya Junction to Bandarawela (91 miles), Mahara Quarry and Mahara Points (15 miles), Fort Junction and Wharf (14 miles), Maradana Junction to Galle (71 miles), Galle and Matara (283 miles), Polgahawela and Kurunegala (13 miles). The total cost of construction up to 31st December, 1896, charged in accounts, was Rs. 52,996,780. The receipts during 1896, Rs. 6,777,832,* and the expenditure Rs. 3,087,790. Of totalled roads there are 2,221-45 miles; of gravelled and natural roads, 639-68 and 508-70 miles; of canals, 165-25 miles. The maintenance of 3,429-83 miles of road cost, in 1895, Rs. 1,124,777-84, or an average rate of Rs. 327-94 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees who collect the commutation received during 1895 a revenue of 999,662 rupees; but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. The amount expended in 1895 was Rs. 977,186. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new water works. The amount expended on irrigation in 1895 was Rs. 268,218-71.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon, Straits and China, and Australia. 2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles, Ceylon, Straits and China, and India, by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia. 3. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, Ceylon, by steamers of the Orient Navigation Company. 4. A fortnightly service by the steamers of the Nordeutscher Lloyd Steam Navigation Company between Europe and Ceylon. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia and China by these steamers. The passage to Brindisi or Marseilles generally occupies from 15 to 18 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, Singapore, and China, 4, 5, 6, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, which is carried on by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company. Letters, &c., from England reach Colombo in about 17 days (14½ minimum, 18¾ maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, the Clan Line, the City Line, &c., the steamers of the first leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports in India, and their fortnightly service between Calcutta and London calls at Colombo.
