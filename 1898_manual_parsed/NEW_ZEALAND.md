NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the Middle, and the South or Stewart's Island. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Colony: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 500 miles east, in 43 45° S. lat., 176°-177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles; the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island is 44,468 square miles, of the Middle Island, 58,525 square miles, of Stewart's Island, 665 square miles, and small outlying groups of islands, 818 square miles, a total area of 104,471 square miles (twice the size of England).

By the Act 26 and 27 Vict. cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. longitude, and 33° and 53° S. latitude, are annexed to New Zealand.
By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, were annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macaulay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands is administered through the Governor of New Zealand. (See Appendix to Pt. II.)

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (56°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (51°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington is 50°, from 82° in summer to 32° in winter. The rainfall varies from a mean for the year of 25 inches on the east coast, to 112 inches on the west coast of the Middle Island, and from 37 inches on the east coast, to 59 inches on the west coast of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the 10 years 1884-93 was 30-20 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 10-08. The birth rate has been gradually declining, and in 1896 was 26-33 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 9-10.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840, the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1896, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 39,854, all of whom dwelt in the North Island, with the exception of 2,523 scattered over the other islands.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1850.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 and 16 Vic., cap. 72. By that Act the Colony was divided into six provinces, subsequently increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vic., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of Government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished provision was made for the division of the colony into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, consisting of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Colony for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments are tenable for seven years only. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector is qualified to become a member. The House of Representatives now consists of 74, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to September.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 150l. a year, payable monthly.

Members of the House of Representatives receive 20l. a month, amounting to 240l. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races), the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Colony and three months in one electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral role.

In 1889 an amendment of the Representation Act was passed, which contained a provision prohibiting any elector from giving his vote in respect of more than one electorate at any election; and by the Electoral Act, 1893, no person is entitled to be registered on more than one electoral roll, whatever the number or nature of qualifications he or she may possess, or wherever they may be.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.
For local bodies the qualification is a ratepayer's one. Women ratepayers can vote as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the Colonial Government. In 1865, the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Colony is divided into 97 municipalities and 81 counties; the latter being subdivided into 242 road districts and 40 town districts. For the year ended 31st March, 1896, the total receipts of the various local authorities amounted to £1,170,357l. and their expenditure to £1,156,478l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to £2,850,619l. For the year ended 31st December, 1895, the receipts, expenditure and debt of Harbour Boards amounted to £405,833l., £451,027l., and £3,770,021l. respectively, and of the Christchurch Drainage Board (the only one in existence) to £23,754l., £19,574l., and £200,000l. respectively.

Education

A Government system of education was established by Law No. 21 of 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of Education Boards and of School Committees, with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of schools on 31st December, 1896, 1,553; number of scholars on roll, 131,037. The schools are free and non-sectarian, and education is compulsory. The University of New Zealand examines and confers degrees and gives scholarships. It has a statutory endowment of £3,000l. a year. There are three colleges for university teaching, at Dunedin, Christchurch, and Auckland. The last-named has a statutory endowment of £4,000l. a year; the other two have landed endowments. A University College for the Middle District of New Zealand was incorporated in 1894, but is not yet at work. There are twenty-four secondary schools, endowed with land or funds arising from public sources. The pupils at these schools numbered 2,614 on 31st December, 1896.

Technical Education.—An act intituled "The Manual and Technical Elementary Instruction Act" for the promotion of manual and technical instruction was passed in 1895. During 1896 the Government distributed £1,424l. in aid of various technical schools and classes. The examination of the Science and Art Department (South Kensington), and the City, and Guilds of London Institute are made use of, and 615 passes in various subjects, theoretical and practical, were obtained in 1896. There are four fully-equipped schools of art attended during the year by about 1,380 students. There are also two Government Schools of Mines; and in connection with the Canterbury College there is an endowed School of Engineering and Technical Science. The Canterbury Agricultural College possesses extensive buildings, has a large endowment of land and an experimental farm of very complete character. Eighty-seven students attended in 1896.

There were also at the same date 74 schools for natives, maintained at the cost of the Government and under the direct control of the Minister, and 4 denominational boarding schools. The numbers at the boarding schools were 217, of whom 73 were supported by Government; and at the other schools 2,862.

The number of pupils in the Deaf Mute Institution was 48; the greatest part of the cost is defrayed by the Government; 1,559 children belong to the authorised industrial schools, of whom 556 were in the schools, 428 boarded out, and the rest were with friends, at service, &c., under licence.

To the school for the blind, under the management of a local society, the Government contributes a subsidy to the extent, approximately, of 24s. for each 20s. subscribed, and pays 25l. a year for each pupil whom it sends to the school. There were 21 such pupils at the end of 1895.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 12th April, 1896, was found by the census to be 703,360 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 39,854.

The population of the chief towns on the 28th March, 1886, 5th April, 1891, and 12th April, 1896, was as follows:

| Year | Wellington | Dunedin | Auckland | Christchurch |
|------|------------|---------|----------|-------------|

Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Colony up to 31st December, 1896, was valued at £52,400,000l.; and the annual production is about one million sterling. The wool exported in 1896 amounted to 129,151,624 lbs., valued at £4,391,848l. In 1855 it amounted to 1,772,344 lbs., valued at £93,104l. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at £19,339l., had developed an export for 1889 of 656,822 cwt., valued at £783,374l., in 1890 of 898,894 cwt., valued at £1,087,617l., in 1891 of 1,000,307 cwt., valued at £1,194,724l., in 1892 of 869,600 cwt., valued at £1,033,577l., in 1893 to 903,836 cwt., valued at £1,085,167l., in 1894 to 1,025,248 cwt., valued at £1,194,545l., in 1895, 1,134,097 cwt., valued at £1,262,711l., and in 1896, 1,103,362 cwt., valued at £1,251,993l.

The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1897, were: Horses, 249,732, against 99,850 in 1874; cattle, 1,138,572, against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 19,138,493, against 11,704,853 in 1874. The number of acres under cultivation in February, 1897, was 1,451,073 exclusive of 10,045,278 acres in sown grasses. 258,608 acres were in wheat, having an estimated yield of 5,426,523 bushels; 372,597 acres were in oats, estimated yield 11,232,803 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttleton, Napier, Nelson, and Wellington are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1896, 492 vessels registered, of 78,014 (net) tons in the aggregate.
The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware, and machinery, sugar, tea, alcohol, books, and stationery; and they are obtained almost entirely from England, Australia, the United States, and China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches in the Colony:—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, and Bank of Australasia. The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand on 31st Dec., 1896, was £14,254,936l., and of their note circulation £971,047l. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Colony, having now 371 branches; the amount deposited therein on 31st December, 1896, was £4,311,635l. The private savings banks number seven, and the total amount to credit of depositors at the end of 1896, was £754,229l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Government Life Insurance Department.

This department was constituted, on the initiative of Sir J. Vogel, by legislative enactments passed in 1869 and 1870, and commenced to transact business in March of the latter year. Its constitution was subsequently modified by Act, passed in 1874, 1884, 1886, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1893, and 1894. By the Act of 1886 an official board to control and manage the investment of a portion of the department's funds in mortgages on land is now constituted. This board consists of the Colonial Treasurer, the Solicitor-General, the Surveyor-General, the Commissioner of Taxes, the Public Trustee, and the Government Insurance Commissioner. The Act empowers loans on mortgage not exceeding £10,000l. to any one person or company. All policies are guaranteed by the State.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the premium rates are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first class lives to the amount of £4,000l. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves.

A reference to the table hereunder will show the scale of premiums charged for the principal classes of business transacted, the amount of profits which have been divided amongst the policy holders, and the rapid growth of the office.

The last valuation was made upon the nominal basis of Hm 4 per cent., but a sum of £81,000 was specially reserved, making the valuation virtually equivalent to one upon a basis of Hm 3½ per cent.

Public Works Policy.

As in most of the Colonies, all the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony, and in the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement. But in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under local boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1897, there were 2,033 miles of Government and 167 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand; and 112 miles of Government and 16 miles of private lines under construction.

The expenditure on the 2,033 miles of Government railways open last year has been £15,577,392l., or an average of £7,662l. a mile; this includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1896-97 was £1,286,158l., and the working expenses £789,054l. The balance of £497,104l. is equal to a return of 3l. 3s. 10d. per cent. on the capital invested. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraphs there are now 6,284 miles of land lines and 16,470 miles of wire, constructed at a cost of £71,351l. There are three submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand, and
one connecting the Colony with Australia and the rest of the civilized world. In the year ending 31 March, 1897, excluding value of Government messages, the revenue was £29,635; number of messages 2,520,169 (of which number 2,285,001 were private or press messages). The principal towns have telephone exchanges. In March, 1897; there were eighteen exchanges and eleven sub-exchanges in operation.

Ordinary tramways have been established in all the principal towns in New Zealand, and Dunedin has in addition two cable lines leading to high-lying suburbs. The ordinary tramways are in some cases worked by steam motors, but horse-power is more generally employed. The cable tramways are practically on the same system as those in San Francisco.

The Government has expended about £508,000 on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels on the goldfields.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations. Auckland, Napier, and Lyttelton have pumping schemes, but the others are supplied by gravitation.

All the principal towns in the Colony have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas. In Wellington the streets are illuminated by the electric light, as are also the parliamentary buildings and many private business establishments.

The coasts of the Colony are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Lyttelton, Greymouth, Westport, New Plymouth, and Napier. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.

The Public Works of the Colony, including both railways and roads, and the erection of public buildings, are now principally carried out on what is known as the co-operative system,—that is, the Government provides all materials and lots the work of construction or erection to parties of artisans and labourers at rates fixed by the officers of the Government, and calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 9s. to 12s. per day for artisans and from 7s. to 8s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day.

Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England by six routes (direct and via San Francisco, Brindisi, Naples, and Marseilles), and with all Australasian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States and Brazil. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, per ½ oz. Newspapers. |
|-----------------------------|
| Within a town . . . 1d. each. |
| " Colony . . . 2½" |
| " Australasia . . . 2½" |
| England and Countries in Postal Union . . . 2½ per 2oz., with minimum of 1d. |

Defence.

Proposals made by Sir W. F. D. Jervois and General H. Schaw for fortifying the ports of Auckland, Wellington, Lyttelton, and Dunedin, by strong batteries and a complete system of submarine mines, are now being carried into execution. At each of the above-named ports torpedo boats fitted for Whitehead torpedoes are also provided.

A permanent force of Artillery and Torpedists is maintained; a force of volunteers has also been organized.
