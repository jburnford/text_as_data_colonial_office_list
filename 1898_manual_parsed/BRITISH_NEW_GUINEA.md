BRITISH NEW GUINEA.

Situation and Area.
The Possession of British New Guinea is composed of a portion of the island of New Guinea, and of a number of islands most of which lie to the south-east of New Guinea. The boundaries of the Possession are as follows:—The S. and S.E. shores of New Guinea, from 141° E. long. eastward as far as East Cape, thence N.W. to 8° S. lat. in the neighbourhood of Mitre Rock, together with the territory lying south of a line from Mitre Rock, proceeding along the said 8° S. parallel to 147° E. long., then in a straight line N.W. to the intersection of 6° S. lat. and 144° E. long., and continuing W.N.W. to the intersection of 5° S. lat. and 141° E. long. together with the Trobriand, Woodlark, d'Entrecasteaux, and Louisiade groups of islands, and all other islands lying between 8° and 12° S. lat. and between 141° and 155° E. long., and not forming part of Queensland; and including all islands and reefs lying in the Gulf of Papua to the north of 8° S. lat.

New Guinea, the largest island in the world if Australia is excluded, lies some 80 miles to the north of Queensland between 0° 0' and 12° 0' S. lat., and between 130° 50' and 154° 30' E. long. Its greatest length is 1,490 miles, and its maximum breadth 430 miles; its area being about 234,768 square miles. The portion of the island which belongs to the Possession, is estimated to contain about 87,786 square miles. The islands which lie near New Guinea, and which form part of the Possession number, great and small, about two hundred. Of these the principal ones are: Kiriwina (in the Trobriand group of D'Entrecasteaux), Woodlark, Normanby, Goodenough, Fergusson, St. Aignan, Rossel and Sudest.

The area of the islands is about 2,754 square miles, giving a total area for the Possession of about 90,540 square miles. The coast line of the mainland portion is about 1,728 miles, that of the islands about 1,936 miles, making a total coast line for the Possession of about 3,664 miles.

Description.
Of the portion of New Guinea which belongs to the Possession, the eastern half is mostly mountainous and hilly, the western half mostly low and flat. The greater part of the country is densely wooded. Here and there open forest country well grassed is met with, but no treeless plains have been found. The land is well watered by rivers, streams, brooks, and springs. Several of the rivers are navigable by small craft for a considerable distance, and have all been navigated to the point at which navigation ceases to be practicable. The Fly River, the largest, has been ascended by a steam launch for a distance of some 550 miles. The highest known point of land in the Posses-
sion is the summit of Mount Victoria, the culminating point of the Owen-Stanley range, which is fully 13,000 feet; but Mount Albert Edward is very nearly the same height, while Mount Scratchley is very little lower. Of the numerous islands which belong to the Possession the majority are lofty in comparison with their size. Most of them are well wooded, but some, like Kiriwina and Nada, are coralline and flat.

The aboriginal native population of the Possession is numerous, probably from 300,000 to 350,000. They may be described as a barbaric race. In agriculture, house, and canoe building, wood carving, and pottery making, and in several of the minor arts of life they have attained a fair degree of proficiency. They recognise fully the rights of property, including the right to individual ownership of land. Although in their blood feuds they, "to obtain payment" in blood for a slain relative, never hesitated to kill even women and children, they are in natural disposition neither blood-thirsty nor cruel. They are cheerful and communicative, very affectionate in their domestic relations, and have a keen sense of humour and fun. In colour they range from deep to light brown. Taking them as a whole, their height and bulk are below the standard for Europeans. There are very few Papuans that will measure 40 inches round the chest. Their heads and features vary so much in size and shape, that they cannot be classed under any one type. The food of the natives chiefly consists of game, which they procure with missile weapons, dogs, nets, and snares; of fish, which they spear, net, or trap; of pigs which they breed; of bananas, yams, taro, and sweet potatoes which they carefully and skilfully cultivate; and of cocoa-nuts and sago. The sago palm is most abundant in the central and western parts of the Possession, but exists all over the colony, especially on the rivers of the north-east coast; and the coconut palm flourishes in a remarkable manner in all parts of the Possession.

History.

The island of New Guinea was discovered in 1511 by Antonio de Abrea, and it was touched by several of the early navigators. The Archipelagos lying to the south-east of New Guinea were discovered by French navigators towards the close of the eighteenth century. The waters that are adjacent to the Archipelagos, and to the south-eastern coasts of New Guinea, have at different periods been surveyed and mapped by British ships of war.

The whole island to the west of 141° E. long. is claimed by the Dutch as suzerains of the Sultan of Tidore. The Dutch have not, as yet taken any steps to settle their part of the island, and raids from it into the Possession have done much harm. That portion of the island which lies to the eastward of 141° E. long., and to the north of British New Guinea belongs to the German Empire. The Germans have established a government in their portion of the island, and several industries are being started there. The acquisition by the British Crown of the portion of the island not claimed by Holland was long advocated by Australian statesmen, and the growing influence of France and Germany in the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the establishment of a penal settlement in the French island of New Caledonia, created some alarm in Australia, lest a country lying so near to Australia, as New Guinea should pass into the hands of a foreign power. To prevent this from taking place as regards the eastern part of New Guinea, the Government of Queensland annexed it to the empire, on the 4th of April, 1883, but this proceeding was not ratified by the Imperial Government. The Intercolonial Convention held at Sydney in Nov. and Dec., 1883, passed resolutions urging the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, and undertook to recommend to their respective legislatures to provide for defraying a part of the cost of a protectorate if one were established by the Imperial Government. On the Australasian colonies agreeing to guarantee 15,000l. a-year, to meet the cost, a Protectorate was proclaimed on the 6th November, 1884, over the south-east coast of New Guinea and the adjacent islands.

General Sir Peter Scratchley was appointed Special Commissioner for the Protectorate, and arrived in 1885, but he succumbed shortly after his arrival in the Protectorate to malarial fever. He was succeeded by the Hon. John Douglas, C.M.G., formerly Premier of Queensland. At the Colonial Conference held in 1887, the Colonies of Queensland, N.S.Wales and Victoria undertook to guarantee 15,000l. a year for ten years, for defraying the cost of administering the territory now forming the Possession, on the understanding that Her Majesty's Sovereignty would be proclaimed over it. By the Queensland British New Guinea Act, 1887, that colony undertook to be responsible for the payment of the 15,000l. a-year. The territory was annexed to the Crown by the newly appointed Administrator, Dr. (now Sir W.) Macgregor, on 4th Sept., 1888.

The Imperial Government provided the Possession with a steamer and steam launch, and paid 5000l. a-year up to the 31st March, 1893, towards their maintenance.* The local revenue raised in the Possession is paid over to Queensland, for distribution amongst the guaranteeing colonies, in reduction of their contributions to the said 15,000l. a-year.

Constitution and Laws.

The constitution of the Possession is regulated by Royal Letters Patent of 8th June, 1888, under which the government is carried on by an administrator, with the advice and assistance of an executive and a legislative council. The correspondence of the administrator with the Secretary of State passes through the Governor of Queensland, and that colony, representing also New South Wales and Victoria, exercises with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a supervision over the affairs of the Possession.

The general law of the Possession is the same as that of Queensland. Special Acts have been passed for the protection of the native population, and for dealing with lands. A code consisting of a series of simple regulations, which are from time to time being added to, has been passed for the benefit of the native population. The courts of the Possession consist of the Central, Petty Sessions, and Native Magistrate's Courts. Appeals lie in both criminal and civil matters, from the Central Court to the Supreme Court of Queensland. There is a constabulary force of about sixty men.

Education.

Four missionary societies are established in the Possession. They are the London Missionary Society, which has for its field the south coast of New Guinea; the Society of the Sacred Heart,

* This has been reduced to 3,000l.
which is established at Yule Island, and along the banks of the Paimumu River; the Australian Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, which extends its influence over all the Archipelagos; and the Anglican Missionary Society, which has as its field the north-east coast of New Guinea. The two first-named societies were in New Guinea before annexation was proclaimed, the last two have come there since the proclamation of sovereignty.

Industry.

With the exception that land cannot be acquired directly from the natives, that firearms, explosives, and intoxicating liquors cannot be supplied to natives, and that the engagement of natives as labourers is subject to certain regulations, no restriction is imposed in the pursuit of any industry in the Possession. Land can be purchased or leased from the Crown. The prices charged for land vary, but land suitable for planting purposes can be obtained in freehold at 2s. 6d. an acre, with easy improvement conditions. The customs tariff is comparatively a light one, ad valorem duties not exceeding 10 per cent. There are three ports of entry, one at Port Moresby, one at Samarai, and the third at Daru. The principal exports of the Possession are pearl-shell, copra, bêche-de-mer, and sandal wood. Gold was first found in the islands of the Louisiade Archipelago in 1888, and since then has been mined for in these islands. Gold has been found in payable quantities, combined with Osmuridium and Cinnahar, round a large part of the foot of Mount Scratchley in the interior of New Guinea. The natives are being induced to plant coconut trees, and are likely in the future to largely extend this industry. A few horses and cattle have been introduced into the Possession, and seem to thrive well.

Mail communication from Port Moresby, and from the portion of the Possession which lies to the eastward of Port Moresby, is with Cooktown, Queensland. Mail communication from the western portion of the possession is chiefly with Thursday Island. A regular mail service is established with Queensland by sailing vessel, under contract, making the round voyage from Cooktown to Samarai and Port Moresby, calling also at intermediate ports and points, and on to Thursday Island, and thence back to Cooktown.
