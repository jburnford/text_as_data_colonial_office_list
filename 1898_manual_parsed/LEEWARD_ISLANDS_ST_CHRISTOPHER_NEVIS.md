ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

The Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis, and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population is 43,963 by the census of 1891, and the total area about 158 square miles, about the size of Rutland.

Constitution.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of ten official and ten nominated unofficial members; the Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator appointed by him, presides, and the Administrator enjoys an original and also a casting vote. Of the ten unofficial members, seven are chosen from among the inhabitants of St. Christopher and Anguilla, and three from Nevis. The council meets at Basseterre in St. Christopher, and is convened at such times as the Governor or Administrator sees fit.

Industry.

Tobacco was at first the principal crop grown, but it soon lost its pre-eminence, and the main industry of the two larger islands is now the production of sugar, molasses, and rum. Arrow-root, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco are also grown in small quantities. Cattle are raised. Salt is produced in St. Kitts and Anguilla. The sugar crop of 1896 amounted to 14,822 tons for St. Kitts and Nevis, and the export of rum was 37,100 gallons, and of molasses 2,891 puncheons. Sugar products form 99½ per cent. of the total exports.

In 1896 a volunteer force was raised, consisting of Mounted Infantry, 55; Infantry, 57; total 112. This force is increasing in strength, and now numbers 179 officers and men.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital. Basseterre, population about 10,000, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1894, 54 sailing vessels of 1,183 tons.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The temperature is from 78° to 85°.

The rainfall for the year 1894 was 42.45 inches.

| Nevis    | 6,868 |

St. Kitts, the native name of which was Liamuiga, or "the fertile island," was the first settled of the Leeward group. Thomas Warner was despatched thither in 1628 by Mr. Ralph Merrifield, but a hurricane destroyed the first results of his first efforts at cultivation, and it was only in 1625, when he had obtained the patronage and assistance of the Earl of Carlisle, and a commission as King's Lieutenant over St. Kitts, alias Merwar's Hope, Nevis, Barbados, and Monserrat, that a permanent lodgment was effected. On the very day that Warner landed, Desnambuc, with a few Frenchmen, reached the island, and in the face of the common enemy, the Caribs, the two colonies settled peacefully side by side, the French obtaining the two ends of the island and the English the middle portion. From thence all the other islands in the group were colonized, and the settlement grew fast. In 1629 they were almost destroyed by the Spaniards, but soon recovered. The war with France and Holland, in the early part of the reign of Charles II, led to a struggle between the colonists of the rival nations, ending in a victory for the French, the English settlers capitulating in 1666. The English part of the island was restored at the peace of Breda, 1667. The same thing happened during the war of the Spanish Succession, and it was not till the Treaty of Utrecht that the island in its entirety passed into the hands of Great Britain. With all the other Leeward Islands it was captured by the French in the beginning of the wars of the French Revolution, but was re-captured after Rodney's victory in 1783.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he appointed in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it. It has a population of about 1,500, and is a port of registry.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two Islands—the distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established.
By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at £550l., and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,300, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, licences, &c.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 291 square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral"
island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £12,092. 11s. 1d. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising also Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771 the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, the Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor. Trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican chief, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £2,000, to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Serious riots occurred in 1893 in connexion with the collection of taxes in the interior of the Island. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. "Mohawk," were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results.

An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who left for Dominica in November, 1893, and returned to England in December of the same year.

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies.

It is estimated that about 130,000 acres in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar has still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is rich and the climate healthy, and the island is well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, cocoa, tea, limes, nutmegs, spices, and tropical fruits of all kinds.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, ash and scoria covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers well stocked with fish, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Coffee, cocoa, and lime-juice are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, is now only exported in comparatively small quantities. A considerable trade is carried on also in fruit, spice, oils, and timber. The principal exports in 1896 were: Coffee, 25,786 lbs.; cocoa, 993,456 lbs.; sugar, 845 tons; limes and lime-juice, value £14,851/; essential oils, value £5,052/.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1896 was 77.30 inches, the mean temperature 82.4 Fahr.

The chief town is Roseau, population about 4,500; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1896, five vessels, of a total tonnage of 89 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of the Colonial Bank at Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 10 members. In 1865 the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members, to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The administrator presides over the deliberations of this body, and exercises a casting vote in the House, and in Committee.

Electors for a parish must possess land or houses to be rented at £1 per annum, or be an occupier of premises worth £1 per annum, or have an income of £25, or pay taxes of £1.5s. per annum.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants speak a French patois.
