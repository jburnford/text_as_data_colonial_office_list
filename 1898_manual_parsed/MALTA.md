MALTA.

Situation and Area.
The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. Valletta, the port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 91.557 square miles; that of Gozo 24.804 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are but islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

History.
Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino mention is made at very early date. The Phoenicians settled in them in B.C. 1519, according to some authors, whilst others give the date B.C. 1400. Diodorus Siculus describes Malta and Gozo as most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. They were afterwards under the dominion of the Greeks, and then of the Carthaginians. During the Punic wars the Maltese islands fell alternately to the lot of the Carthaginians and Romans, and were ultimately occupied by the latter. During the Roman occupation the shipwreck of Paul took place (Acts xxviii). On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell into the hands of the Goths, and then into those of the Saracens, who were expelled in 1090 by Count Roger the Norman. It was under the dominion of the House of Aragon from 1190 until 1530, when it was granted by the Roman Emperor Charles V to the Order of the Knights of St. John, by whom it was held for more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, the Grand Master Hompesch capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte, who dispersed the Order. The Maltese, however, rose against the French, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they were closely blockaded by the British fleet aided by the Maltese for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered, and the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain, 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

Climate.
The climate of Malta is equable and very healthy in winter. In August the heat at the sea level approaches that experienced in the tropics. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind. The maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 61° Fahr., and the minimum 53½°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is 82½° Fahr., and the minimum 73½°. The mean temperature is 67°, and the annual rainfall varies from 10 to 20 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous sandstone beds, and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

Industry.
The island is highly cultivated; its principal products are cotton, potatoes, and corn; the vine is grown; oranges of very superior quality and figs are abundant; honey of a superior kind is also produced; and early crops of potatoes and onions are exported to England. Many cattle, sheep, horses and goats are reared. But a large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the enormous trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepot and port of call. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1896—122 vessels of together 8,337 tons. There is a large trade with Tunis, Tripoli, Algeria, Italy, and the Levant.

Chief Towns.
The population, according to the census, 1891 is 177,457, including garrison, Royal Navy, and merchant shipping. The chief town and capital is Valletta, having with its suburbs of Floriana, Sienna, and St. Julian's, a population of 37,909 in 1891. The "three cities" on the other side of the harbour from Valletta (Senglea, Cospicua, and Vittoriosa) have a population of 26,737. Citta Vecchia, the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, has a population of 8,008 in 1891. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), population 6,124.

Inhabitants.
The inhabitants of the country districts resemble the southern Italians in appearance, and in some districts show distinct traces of their Punic descent. In the towns and among the upper classes are to be found representatives of families who have settled in Malta from many different countries. The Maltese dialect which is generally spoken is of Semitic origin, and is held to be derived from the Carthaginian and Arabic tongues. The educated and commercial classes usually speak also Italian or English, or both. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, hard-working, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found as traders in Tunis, Egypt, and around the Mediterranean coast.

Currency and Banking.
The legal tender currency is, under Order in Council of September 24th, 1886, exclusively Brit-
There are two local banks (Banco di Malta and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The first two banks have a small note circulation, reported to amount to about 20,000l., and the deposits in the three banks are estimated at about 200,000l. The Government savings bank, established in 1833, had on 31st December, 1896, 498,536l. deposits.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway 7½ miles in length and 3 feet 3 in. gauge, now belonging to the Malta Government, which was originally built by the Malta Railway Company at the cost of about 90,000l., and there are 65 miles of telegraph, constructed and worked by the military authorities, but open to public use. Valetta has an extensive telephone system (320 miles in 1896), and is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables to Gibraltar, Bone (Algeria), Sicily (2), Alexandria (2), and Zante.

It is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is a most important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling in quarantine, and at any hour, day and night, and for ensuring the delivery of full weight of bunker coals when owners call for a Custom House certificate of weight. There is direct mail communication with nearly every Mediterranean port, several times per week, and with England, via Sicily or Reggio or Brindisi, daily, except on Sundays. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per oz. | Newspapers |
|-----------------|------------|
| Internal Europe, Tunis, the Levant, the United States, and all Postal Union Countries | ½d. Free |

The total correspondence despatched in 1896 was: Letters 1,270,113; post cards, 54,607; newspapers, 391,569. Internal correspondence received and despatched: Letters, 815,462; newspapers, 495,696.

Public Works.

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and has greatly improved their sanitary condition. The reorganization of the water supply, hitherto very defective, has also been taken in hand, and considerable water works have been established for raising and distributing at high pressure an effective supply of pure water for all purposes. These works have now been extended to all the large villages and to Gozo. In connection with this work arrangements are contemplated for an extension of the means of irrigation, and for utilizing drainage. Considerable progress has also been made lately in improving the roads and streets and in public lighting. Electric lighting has been installed and is being worked in Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities, including the Great Harbour and Marsamuscetto Harbour. The harbour accommodation has been greatly improved, a loan of 20,000l. having been made from Imperial funds in 1873 to the Anglo-Maltese Hydraulic Dock Company, under the Colonial Docks Act.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, established in 1881, and reconstituted in 1887; it consists of ten members besides the President and the clerk. Legislation is carried on by means of a partly elective council of government originally constituted by letters patent of 11th May, 1849, and re-constituted by letters patent of 12th Dec., 1887. It now consists of six official members and fourteen elected, four of whom are returned by special electors, and chosen from the classes of ecclesiastics, nobles, university graduates, and members of the chamber of commerce respectively. Public officers are ineligible for election, and not more than two ecclesiastics may be chosen by the general electors. The islands are divided into ten electoral districts, returning one member each. The total number of electors is over 10,000. The qualification for a member of Council is the possession of immovable property of the clear value of 100l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of rent for immovable property to the annual value of 10l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of 40l. a year for board and lodging, for the same period previous to election. The qualification for a general elector is an income from immovable property of 6l. per annum, or the payment of rent to the amount of 6l. per annum for six calendar months before registration, or, independently of both, the age of twenty-one years, and qualification to serve as a common juror. That of a special elector, and of the members elected by this class, is an income from immovable property of 60l., or payment of rent of that amount. The Council of Government, unless sooner dissolved, lasts three years. The Governor is ex officio President, with the power of veto. A Vice-President was appointed by Letters Patent dated 6th February, 1893. The Governor, or the Vice-President, if present, may depute an official member to preside. There are no municipalities or other forms of local government.

Education and Religion.

Primary education is carried on almost exclusively in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are two secondary schools with 209 scholars, and 118 primary and infants' schools with 13,697 pupils. There is a public lyceum with 500 scholars, and a university (founded in 1769) with 99 students. At these two latter institutions the fees are extremely low, being respectively 1s. and 2s. 6d. per family per month. There are numerous private secondary schools. The total number of these schools is 126, with 3,763 scholars. Education is not compulsory. The Roman Catholic religion is almost universal amongst the Maltese.

Defence.

Malta is the principal naval station in the Mediterranean, and is strongly fortified. Valetta is defended by massive and extensive works, and the garrison of over 11,887 N.C.O. and men, includes 671 R.M.A., 1,450 R.M. Militia, and 59 Malta Militia Division, Royal Engineers. The Island Government contributes 5,000l. for military contribution.

Revenue.

There is no direct taxation of any kind. The most important sources of revenue are the Customs duties, port dues, and land revenue.

Weights and Measures.

Malta barrel is equal to 9½ imperial gallons.
,, salm ,, 1 ,, quarter.
,, cantar ,, 175 lbs. English.
,, catlisso ,, 4½ imperial gallons.
