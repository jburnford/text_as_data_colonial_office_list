The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. Besides the peninsula a strip of territory stretching about three miles inland belongs to England, the whole area being about seventy square miles. Dhala and El Hota are the principal villages outside the town of Aden. The rainfall never exceeds 7 inches in a year. The town of Aden is situated on the side of a rocky promontory, and is very strongly fortified. It is a most important coaling station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The imports in 1887 amounted to 1,870,507l., and the exports to 1,507,718l. The exports consist of coffee, dyes, feathers, gums, spices, &c. The imports from Great Britain in 1887 were 155,670l., and the exports to were 337,724l.

It is 72 miles by 22 miles, with peaks 200 feet high. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October 1886, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kute and Bromers Islands.

In 1887 also a Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali coast, extending from the point of Ras Tadjuré on the southern coast of the Bay of Tadjura to Bundee Ziadele in the 94 parallel E. long. The protectorate is regulated under the "Somali Order in Council" of 13th December, 1889, by the Acting Consul for the Somali Coast, Lieut.-Col. E. V. Stace.
