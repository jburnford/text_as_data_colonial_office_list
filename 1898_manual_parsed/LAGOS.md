LAGOS.

Situation and Area.

The Colony and Protectorate of Lagos is situated on the Bight of Benin, and is comprised within 2° and 6° east longitude. Its sphere of influence extends to the 9th parallel of north latitude, embracing the whole of the Yoruba country.

The Colony itself, consists of the coast line from the boundary of the French Protectorate of the kingdom of Porto Novo (the river Ajarra) on the west, to Aboto on the Mahin Beach on the east, and includes Badagry, Lagos Island (the capital of the Colony), Ebute Metta, and Iddo Island, Ikorodu, Ejinrin, and Epe, with Palma, Leckie, and the Mahin Beach.

Ikorodu is the latest acquisition to the Colony (ceded August, 1894), and the Jebu strip on the north bank of the lagoon now extends from Orichi on the Ogun River, in a direct line half a mile to the north of the village of Majoda, situated on the road between Epe and Jebu Ode, and from thence proceeding due east to the Oshun River. By this acquisition the Colony commands all the main routes to the Interior.

The Protectorate comprises the kingdoms of Pokra, Okeodan, Ilaro, Addo, and Igbesa, with the Awori Country, Jebu Remo (1894), Mahin, Orgbo and Jakri, up to the right bank of the Benin River on the east, where it adjoins the territory of the Niger Coast Protectorate.

For administrative purposes the country is divided into the central, the western, the north-western, the eastern, and the north-eastern districts, with district commissioners stationed respectively at Lagos, Badagry, Ikorodu, Leckie, and Epe. In the Hinterland, resident officers are stationed at Ibadan, Jebu Ode, Shagamu, and at Odo Otin. There is also a superintendent of native affairs at Abeokuta.

Lagos Island has an area of 34 square miles, and the whole Colony and Protectorate probably includes about 1,500 square miles.

The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Freetown, 315 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass.

History.

The King of Lagos (Kosoko), having refused to co-operate in putting down the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akitoye's son and successor, King Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown, in consideration of a pension of 1,000l. a-year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate Government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the
West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief, at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further letters patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Iddo Island. In 1862, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Ketou, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Ketou, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1885, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.

In 1890, Ketou was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagry.

An expedition was sent against the Jebus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Colony of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

**Constitution.**

The Government is conducted by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The latter includes four nominated unofficial members. The law consists entirely of local ordinances and Orders in Council, with such English Acts as are of general application.

The Colony is associated with Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast Colony in contributing towards the salary of the Bishop of Sierra Leone and towards the subsidy paid for telegraph maintenance. It also contributes towards the total cost of the audit of the accounts of the Colony by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.

**Industry.**

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, and brickmaking. A saw mill has recently been established, and native builders, carpenters, and blacksmiths do fair work.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the inland waters, the fish being dried and sent into the interior.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. A very extensive trade has therefore grown up, amounting, in 1893, to over a million and a half sterling. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, country cloths, rum, geneva, specie, and tobacco. The chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France. The quantities and values of the principal exports during 1896 were palm kernels, 47,649 tons, value £13,206l.; palm oil, 3,154,333 gals., value £205,532l.; cotton goods, value £159,151l.; country cloths, value £2,535l.; rum, 14,047½ gals., value £1,366l.; geneva, 1,364 gals., value £101l.; specie, £8,870l.; tobacco, £141,128½ lbs., value £2,985l.; rubber, 6,484,363 lbs., value £47,722l.

**Chief Towns.**

Lagos town has now about 33,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the whole West African coast. Epe is probably the largest town in the Colony outside Lagos, population about 6,000. The next largest towns are Badagry, with a population of 4,022, Leckie, and Ikorodu.

**Currency and Banking.**

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with some Spanish, American, and French gold coins. Cowries (1,000 = 3d.) are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders. A Government savings bank was established on the 1st January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on 31st December, 1896, held deposits amounting to £13,401l. 1s. 3½d.

During 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged in a company named The Bank of British West Africa.

**Means of Communication.**

A railway is in course of construction, and internal telegraphs will follow. Lagos Island is now in telegraphic communication with the Congo, South Africa, Bonny and Brass, the Gold Coast, and Europe, and via Accra, with the Gaboon, Louanda, Kutoum, and Porto Novo. There is also a weekly mail service to and from these places, and communication about once a month with Hamburg. With Brazil and the United States there is frequent communication by sailing vessels. The internal communication is chiefly by water, along the network of lagoons. There is telephonic communication between the various government offices.

**Rates of Postage.**

| Letters per oz. | Newspapers per 4 ozs. |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Within the Colony | ½d.                  |
| To the United Kingdom and Postal Union countries | 2½d.                |

*(Parcels to and from England, 9d. per lb.)*

Parcels to and from British Colonies in West Africa, 6d. per lb.

Money Orders are issued at a commission of 2½d. for every 10s., or portion of 10s., for sums not exceeding 20l.

In 1896—108,225 letters, 3,596 postcards, 86,260 book packets, samples, and circulars, and 3,061 parcels were dealt with in the Lagos Post Office. The value of money orders sent from Lagos was £10,281l. 1s. 7½d.; received in Lagos, £5,241l. 16s. 10½d.

**Education.**

There are no Government schools, but a system of Government inspection and examination has been introduced under the supervision of an Education Board and a Local Inspector of Schools, under which grants were made during the past year to the schools of the various Christian denominations amounting in all to £1,151l.; about 3,371 school children are on the school rolls. Fees are charged, and education is not compulsory. The Mohammedans, who are much on the increase, maintain their own schools, where Arabic is taught.
Climate and Inhabitants.

The mean temperature is 81°, the extreme range being from 68° to 91°. The rainy season extends from May to October, a lull occurring generally in July and August. The annual rainfall is about 70 inches.

The native inhabitants are mainly of the negro race; about one-fourth of them speak English. There are about 200 persons of European birth in the Colony.

Defence.

There is an armed force of Hausa constabulary of 844 men, and a civil police numbering 329. The Hausa force is armed with the Martini-Enfield carbines and the civil police with Snider rifles.

The Leeward Islands, so called in contrast to the Windward Islands, which are most exposed to the N.E. Trade, the prevailing wind in the West Indies, form the most northerly group of the Lesser Antilles, the whole of which were included among the Windward Islands as the term was used by the Spaniards. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland, (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), and France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin). The English Leeward Islands (except Somboro, see page 289), comprising the Presidencies of Antigua, with its dependencies, Barbuda and Redonda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, and Nevis, including Anguilla, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the Colony is 704 square miles, about the size of the county of Surrey, and its population about 127,728.

History.

The Islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 3 and 4 Will. IV, c. 74. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Colonies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 46 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler, but more subject to hurricanes. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December.

Constitution.

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 15 of 1882, the Legislative Council now consists of ten elective and ten non-elective members. Four elective members are chosen by the elective members of the Island Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Assembly of Dominica, and four by the non-official members of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The non-elective members appointed by the Queen are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Administrator of St. Kitts and Nevis, with five unofficial members, one from each of the island councils, and another member of one of them who acts as President.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, procedure in maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets once a year, at a place notified by proclamation (usually at St. John, Antigua), and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts from two to four weeks.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies, Antigua bearing five-sixteenths, Dominica three-sixteenths, Montserrat one-sixteenth, St. Kitts and Nevis three-eighths, and the Virgin Islands one-sixteenth.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the Queen's pleasure, and the Queen has power at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from both Councils.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being
occasionally met with. In addition to these, the gold doubloons are legal tender. The Colonial Bank has a branch in Antigua, one in St. Kitts, and one in Dominica. In the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, and Nevis, there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (£3,500), and St. Kitt's (£14,000), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies except the Virgin Islands.

Means of Communication.

Mail communication exists between England and the Southern Islands, including Trinidad, and with the Northern Islands and Jamaica, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the same islands, as far as Trinidad, and to the United States of America, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line. The Royal Mail Company also runs a steamer on regular days in each week, connecting the various islands of the group, under a contract with the Colonial Government. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scrutton's Direct Line and others. The usual time occupied by the voyage from England to Antigua is about 14 days.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia and Martinique, and two St. Kitts with Antigua and St. Thomas; Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable station to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

Postage.

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union (to England 2½d. per ½ oz.). Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Dominica, the rates being 1d. the ½ oz. within each of the islands.

Chief Towns.

The most important towns are St. John (Antigua), 10,000; Basseterre (St. Kitts), 7,000; and Roseau (Dominica), 4,500.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

In Antigua there is a Yeomanry Cavalry Corps consisting of 35 officers and men, and small Artillery Corps. In St. Kitts there was until 1888 a Horse Artillery Corps, and two troops of Cavalry, the strength of the former being 26 men, and of the latter 56, officers included.

There are numerous old forts, mostly dismantled and in ruins, situated round the coasts of the several islands.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans, and Roman Catholics. The schools established by these denominations receive grants in aid from the local revenues of each Presidency. School fees are charged, and the schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants in aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. There are about 125 aided schools, attended by 20,879 children. Grants of varying amount are also made to grammar schools established in all the islands except the Virgin Islands. Provision is also being made for technical education.
