WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 116° 52' E.

Note.—With a few exceptions the salaries of Public Officers were reduced during the years ended the 30th June, 1893, 1894, 1896, and 1897, according to a scale, ranging from 5 to 15 per cent.
Physical Features.

The coast line, extending for a distance of about 5,200 miles, is indented by a certain number of bays, creeks, and harbours, and in the northern parts fringed by numerous islands. In the south there are three separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The loftiest range in the Southern District is the Stirling Range, the highest point of which is about 3,500 feet. The principal other ranges are known as the Blackwood, Darling, and Roe; these, with the exception of Mount William, in the Murray District, 3,000 feet high, do not reach greater altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea. In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the Leopold and the Mueller ranges, the highest point in the latter attaining about 2,300 feet. The settled districts are usually level or undulating, rarely mountainous. The western seaboard is comparatively flat, of a sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation. To the eastward of the Darling range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character, and improves for some distance inland. The north and north-eastern parts of the Colony contain a large area of good pastoral country, suitable also in some parts for the growth of tropical products, such as sugar and coffee.

The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the north, to Point d'Entrecasteaux in the south, a distance of about 300 miles.

Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this range, and flow into the sea to the westward.

The principal rivers of the Colony are the Ord, Prince Regent, Panton, Fitzroy, De Grey, Harding, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoyne, Murchison, Greenough, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Collie, Preston, Blackwood, Warron, Pallinup, and Gordon. Most of these are mere storm-water channels filled only during the rainy season, and very few of them are navigable for any distance even for small boats.

Lakes and Islands.

The lake district may be considered to be confined to the westward of the Darling range; within this area there are numerous salt and fresh water lakes and lagoons—but many of them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.

Numerous islands and islets occur along the coast-line. Dirk Hartog Island, in Sharks Bay, is the largest of those used for pastoral purposes, whilst guano is found on the islands comprised in Houtman's Abrolhos, the Lacepedes, and various other islands on the north-west coast.

History.

In 1825 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1827 Captain James Stirling, in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and in 1829 Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. "Challenger," took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle (the latter named after Captain Fremantle mentioned above), and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1850, the Colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned that it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution was what is called "Representative," established by Act 33 Victoria, No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The legislature consists of two houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 24 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 44 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The Colony is divided into 8 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the Colony for at least 2 years; (3) a natural born subject of Her Majesty or naturalized for 5 years, and a resident in the Colony during that period.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Colonial Treasurer (also Colonial Secretary), the Minister of Mines, the Director of Public Works (also Commissioner of Railways), the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Minister of Education and the Attorney-General.

Local Government.

Under Act 59 Vict., No. 10, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Beverley, Bunbury, Bulong, Broad Arrow, Russelton, Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Cossack, Cue, Day Dawn, Esperance, Fremantle, Geraldton, Gingin, Guildford, Helena Vale, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Leederville, Mt. Magnet, Menzies, Nannine, Newcastle, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, Perth, Roebourne, Southcru Cross, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000, consist of a chairman and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and for each ward three councillors—the mayor or chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. "The Water Works Act, 1889" (53 Vic. 13), the Perth City Council is authorized to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £; also under "The Public Health Act, 1886," Councils of Municipalities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 3d. in the £; 41,392l. was granted in 1896 to district roads boards (of which there are 72) and municipal councils (31) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the Colony.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the Colony at the 31st December, 1896, was estimated to be 137,946, consisting of 96,952 males, and 40,994 females, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese was 1,558, of whom 1,540 were males and only 13 females. In June 1847 the estimated population was 157,791.

The chief towns are Perth (43,000), Fremantle (15,000), Coolgardie (12,000), Kalgoorlie '12,000), Albany (2,800), Bunbury (1,200), Cue (1,050), Esperance (1,000), Geraldton (3,000), Guildford (1,150), Menzies (1,600), York (1,200).

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the Colony, 8,369,200 acres only have been alienated or are in process of alienation, while 83,134,509 acres are leased for pastoral, and 20,232 for other purposes. No less than 538,004,859 acres are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 5,200 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. In the south-west corner of the Colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the Colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total area of arable land on 28th Feb., 1897, was 163,288 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,248,976) are depastured in all parts of the Colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1896, principally to London, was 10,995,659 lbs. which, at 5½d. per lb. for greasy and 9½d. per lb. for scoured, is valued at 267,506l. A considerable quantity of wine is also made. In 1896, 111,738 acres were under crop.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1896 was valued at 116,420l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore, China, and other places to the value of about 65,800l. during 1896.

At Sharks Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of Pearls and pearl shell amounted to 50,212l. in 1896.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but for the last few years little work has been done in them, owing to the fall in the value of these metals. The prospects in copper are, however, improving.
The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

Since the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining has become the principal industry of the Colony, and so rapidly has the annual output of gold increased of late, that it promises at no distant date, to place Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing Colonies of Australasia.

There are now (December, 1897) sixteen gold-fields in existence.—Kimberley, I'llbarra, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Murchison, East Murchison, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, and a large population continually employed in searching for, and extracting, precious metals.

Much machinery is now in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a great future before them, judging from the steady increase both in returns and population. The value of gold exported up to the end of Oct., 1897, was £5,678,581L. In the first ten months of 1897, the value of the gold export was £2,001,601L against £38,802L in the corresponding period of 1896.

There is also evidence of the existence of good coal both in the south-west corner of the Colony and in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood River, and the total export of this mineral to the end of 1896 is estimated at 70,192L. There is little doubt that a fairly rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in very small quantities.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Australasia.

The deposits in the banks on 30th June, 1897, were £4,128,256L, and the advances by the banks, £3,877,237L.

A Government Post Office saving bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year, ended 30th June, 1895, amounted to £217,930L, during the year ended 30th June, 1896, to £520,016L, and during the year ended 30th June, 1897, to £1,068,322L.

A branch of the Royal Mint is in course of erection and will shortly be opened in Perth.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are under the supervision of the Minister of Education, assisted by elected district boards. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (58 Vict., No. 30), and are enforced.

By the "Assisted Schools Abolition Act, 1895" (59 Vic., No. 27), the grants to private schools were discontinued, but a compensation was made to the schools that had so far received subsidy, the sum of £15,000L being divided amongst them in proportion to the grants received by them during 1895.

The amount expended on education for 1896 was £32,751L, on school buildings £31,232L. A high school is also subsidised by the State.

On 31st December, 1896, there were 150 Government schools in the Colony, with 9,008 scholars on the rolls, and 56 private schools, with 4,032 scholars. Total 13,040.

Means of Communication.

The Colony possesses at present four lines of Government railways: The Eastern Railway (433 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, Guildford, Northam Southern Cross, Coolgardie, and Kalgoorlie, with branch lines from Clackline Junction to Newcastle (14 miles), from Spencer's Brook Junction to York and Beverley (38 miles), and one mile to the Perth racecourse; the Northern Railway, with a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district, one from Geraldton to Walkaway (18 miles), and one from Geraldton to Mullewa (57 miles) the South-Western Railway from Perth to Bunbury (165 miles), including with a line from Picton Junction to Vasse (38 miles), and a line from Boyanup Junction to Donnybrook, (10 miles)—in all, 970 miles of railway open for traffic, and the Great Southern from Beverley to Albany (243 miles). A line from Mullewa to Cue (196 miles) is practically open but will remain in the hands of the contractors until 30th June, 1898.

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Midland Junction and Walkaway, and connects the two Government railways.

There are also several lines constructed by private timber companies in the south of the Colony in extent about 52 miles; one, the Darling Range Railway, running from Guildford into the Darling Range (20 miles). The following lines are now under construction by Government:—Brunswick to Collie coalfields (26 miles), Bridgetown (42 miles), Menzies (80 miles), Kaukowna (12 miles), Boulder (9 miles), Greenhills (13 miles), Extension, Bayswater Branch (14 miles), Branch to Bunbury racecourse (1½ miles). The receipts of the Government railways for the year ending June, 1897, were £915,983L, and the working expenses £577,655L. The total cost of construction has been £3,736,477L.

Of electric telegraph at the end of 1896 there were 6,948 miles of wire, and 263 more miles in course of erection. The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1896 was 1,178,426, and the revenue received £99,247L. (worked by Post Office Department); cost of Post and Telegraph, £269,012L.

There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and also by a direct cable from Java to Roe buck Bay. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the Colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 577 miles of private telephone wire in the Colony, and 2,172 miles of railway telephone.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient Companies, and Messageries Maritimes carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, and the other Australasian colonies. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australasian
colonies by the various intercolonial steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 30 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

- Letters, Newspapers per ½ oz. papers.
  - Within a Town . . . . . . 1d. Free*
  - Australasia . . . . . . 2d. ¼d. per 10 ozs.
  - United Kingdom and Postal Union . . . . . . 2½d. 1d. per 4 ozs.

The postal statistics for 1896 give the following as the number (each counted once) of letters and postcards, &c., received and despatched:

| English, Intercolonial, and Foreign. |
|-------------------------------------|
| Letters . . . . . . 5,985,912        |
| Newspapers . . . . . 2,879,198        |
| Packets and parcels . . . . . . 1,293,581 |

Postcards . . . . . . 189,499

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 144 vessels and a tonnage of 8,113 on 31st December, 1896. Harbour works there are progressing satisfactorily.

**Defence.**

In December, 1896, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 150 of all ranks. Of this number 147 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder principally to the various rifle corps. King George's Sound, on the south coast, is being strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office.

**Aborigines.**

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. They were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers; as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they used to be largely utilised as pearl-shell divers, whilst their industry was confined to moderately shallow waters. As a general rule they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned the successful mission conducted at Wew Norcia (by the Right Reverend Bishop Salvado), which was commenced in the year 1846. There is now a Board of Management appointed by the Governor, which deals with all matters connected with the aborigines. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia has been passed by both houses of legislature, and is now awaiting the Sovereign's assent. In accordance with its clauses, the welfare of the natives is to be entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a minister of the Crown, and provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of £5,000, to be used by such sub-department.

**Climate.**

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The mean average death-rate is 16 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33-28 inches (for 21 years), 33-81 inches (for 7 years), and the mean temperature is 64°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

Tobago has been united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. The remaining three British Colonies are now grouped for administrative pur-
poses under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and its population about 146,000.

**History.**

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was united to Trinidad 1st Jan., 1889.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent, being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

**Constitution.**

Each island retains its own institutions, and when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. A common audit system was instituted in 1889.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling doubloons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

**Communications.**

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 13 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Barbados for the purpose of transhipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call at least once a month, and there is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York, Grenada being the first and last port of call.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A government telephone system of exchanges has been constructed at Grenada, and connects all the out-districts with the town of St. George. A similar system is in course of construction at Vincent. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cable to St. Thomas and St. Croix. The rate per word for telegrams to Europe from Grenada is 7s. 9½d.
