TRISTAN D'ACUNHA.

Tristan d'Acunha and Gough Island are the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6' S. and long. 12° 2' W. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. Upon his death the garrison was withdrawn, with the exception of three men, who, with certain shipwrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement. For a long time only one of the settlers had a wife, but subsequently the others contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. The population, when the island was visited in February, 1890, by one of H.M. ships, was found to be only 84. It remains practically stationary, as the younger and more ambitious settlers migrate in batches to the Cape. The inhabitants practically enjoy their possessions in common, and there is no strong drink on the island, and no crime. It was at one time proposed to give them laws and a regular government, but this was found unnecessary for the above reasons, and they remain under the moral rule of their oldest inhabitant, Governor Green, successor to Governor Glass, Corporal in the Royal Artillery, and founder of the settlement. The inhabitants are spoken of as long-lived, healthy, moral, religious, and hospitable to strangers. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a man-of-war in 1886, nearly all the able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885. There are 300 cattle and 200 sheep on the islands, and crops of potatoes are raised.

MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS.

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants, but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection, or for coconut planting. The rents are paid into the Exchequer. Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island and Cato Island (in the Norfolk Island Group), Sombrero (West Indies, with a Board of Trade Lighthouse costing £20 annually), Raine Island, Bell Cay and Bramble Cay near British New Guinea), Sydney Island, Phoenix Group, leased to Mr. Arundel (4° 25' S. lat., 171° 13' W. long.), the Caroline and Flint Islands (Pacific Ocean, leased to Mr. Arundel, 9° 56' S. lat., 150° 6' W. long., and 11° 26' S. lat. and 151° 48' W. long.), Malden Island (4° 1' S. lat., 155° 57' W. long.), leased to Messrs. Grice, Sumner, and Co., Pilgrim Island, Ducie Island, Bauman, Roggewein, and Teinhoven Islands, Coral Island and Dudosa, Starbuck Island, Little Scrub Island, Palmerston Island, Vostoc, Willis's Islets (all in the Pacific Ocean), and there are many others.

Humphrey (Manahiki) and Rierson (Rakahanga) Islands, lying to the north of the Cook Islands, about 160° W. long. and 10° S. lat., were also annexed in 1889. Christmas, Fanning, and Penrhyn Islands were annexed in March, 1888, in view of the possibility of their being utilised in connection with the projected telegraph cable from Vancouver to Australasia. Christmas Island (1° 57' N. lat., 157° 27' W. long.) is an atoll 90 miles in circumference, barren, with only brackish water. A trading firm collects mother of pearl shells. Fanning Island (3° 51' N. lat., 159° 22' W. long.) is a small atoll 9 miles by 4, covered with coconut trees, copra and guano being exported. Penrhyn Island (9° S. lat., 158° 3' W. long.) is an atoll 30 miles in circumference, partly covered with coconut trees, and having a population of 300. Mother of pearl is exported. Suwarrow Island (13° 13' S. lat., 163° 9' W. long.) was annexed for a similar reason, 22nd April, 1888; a protectorate was established over Jarvis Island, the Phoenix group, comprising Phoenix, Birnie, Hull, Gardner, and Sydney Islands, Washington or New York Island, and Palmyra Island and Johnson Island.*

The Great and Little Basses and Minicoy are small islets in the Indian Ocean, with lighthouses maintained by the Board of Trade out of shipping dues levied on vessels passing, and collected at Ceylon, Mauritius, Straits, and Indian ports.

The Kurian-Muriyan Islands, five in number, off the south-east coast of Arabia, were ceded by the Imam of Muskat for the purpose of landing the Red Sea telegraph cable. On one of them, Hallaniyah, is the signalling station maintained by the Telegraph Company. The whole group is leased for the purpose of guano collection.

Amboyna Cay and Sprattley Island (lat. 8° 38' N., 111° 54' E. long.; lat. 7° 52' N., 112° 55' E. long.), two uninhabited sandbanks in the middle of the China Sea, lying about 240 miles N.W. of Borneo and 100 miles N. of Labuan, were annexed in 1877, and leased for guano collection. They are annually visited by Chinese junks for the purpose of collecting turtle.

A fresh lease was granted in 1889 to the Central Borneo Company, Limited, Winchester House, Old Broad-street, E.C.

* Since withdrawn, and acknowledged to belong to Hawaii, on condition that the right to land a cable is conceded if desired.

The Objects of the Institute are:—

"To provide a place of meeting for all gentlemen connected with the Colonies and British India, and others taking an interest in Colonial and Indian affairs; to establish a reading room and library, in which recent and authentic intelligence upon Colonial and Indian subjects may be constantly available, and a Museum for the collection and exhibition of Colonial and Indian productions; to facilitate interchange of experiences amongst persons representing all the dependencies of Great Britain; to afford opportunities for the reading of papers, and for holding discussions upon Colonial and Indian subjects generally; and to undertake scientific, literary, and statistical investigations in connection with the British Empire. But no paper shall be read, or any discussion be permitted to take place, tending to give to the Institute a party character." (Rule I.)

There are two classes of fellows (who must be British subjects), resident and not-resident, both elected by the council on the nomination of two fellows, one of whom at least must sign on personal knowledge. The former pay an entrance fee of 3l., and an annual subscription of 2l.; the latter an entrance fee of 1l. 1s. (which is increased to £3 when taking up permanent residence in the United Kingdom), and an annual subscription of 1l. 1s. (which is increased to 2l. when in the United Kingdom for more than three months). Resident fellows can compound for the annual subscription by the payment of 20l., or after five years' annual subscription of 2l. on payment of 15l.; and non-resident fellows can compound for the non-resident annual subscription on payment of 10l.

The privileges of fellows, whose subscriptions are not in arrear, include the use of rooms, papers, and library. All fellows, whether residing in England or the Colonies, have a copy of the monthly journal, containing a report of each meeting, and the annual volume of proceedings forwarded to them.

To be present at the evening meetings, and to introduce one visitor.
To be present at the Annual Conversazione, and to introduce a lady.

The Institute occupies its own house, which is open on weekdays from 10 to 8 p.m., and comprises library, reading, news rooms, writing rooms, smoking room, offices, &c. The library, of 33,000 volumes (including pamphlets), chiefly on Colonial subjects Books may be borrowed, and visitors, introduced by a Fellow, are admitted.

The Annual Meeting is held in February or March; ordinary meetings are held at 8 p.m. on the second Tuesday (as a general rule) of the months from November to June, as well as occasional afternoon meetings, for the reading and discussion of papers. The number of members on 20th October, 1897, was 4,180.

CHAPTER I.
CLASSIFICATION OF COLONIES.

[This classification is largely obsolete; for more recent information see the Introduction to Part II.—Ed. C. O. L.]

1. British Colonies may be divided into three classes:
   1. Crown Colonies, in which the Crown has the entire control of legislation, while the administration is carried on by public officers under the control of the Home Government.
   2. Colonies possessing Representative Institutions but not Responsible Government, in which the Crown has no more than a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the control of public officers.
   3. Colonies possessing Representative Institutions and Responsible Government, in which the Crown has only a veto on legislation, and the Home Government has no control over any public officer except the Governor.

2. In Gibraltar and St. Helena, Laws may be made by the Governor alone, and in other Crown Colonies by the Governor with the concurrence of a Council nominated by the Crown. In some Colonies, acquired by conquest or cession, the authority of this Council rests on the will of the Crown. In others, chiefly those acquired by Settlement, the Council is created by the Crown under authority of some Imperial or Local Law.

Crown Councils of the former Class exist in the following Colonies:
   1. Ceylon.
   2. Mauritius.
   3. Hong Kong.
   4. Labuan.
   5. Trinidad.
   6. St. Lucia.
   7. Fiji.

Crown Councils of the latter or Statutory Class exist in the following Colonies:
   *1. Jamaica.
   *2. Straits Settlements.
   *3. Sierra Leone.
   *4. Gambia.
   *5. Gold Coast and Lagos.
   *6. Grenada.
   *7. Falkland Islands.
   *8. Honduras.
   *9. St. Vincent.
   *10. Tobago.

Laws may also be made by Order in Council in all the above Colonies, except those marked with an asterisk.

3. In Colonies possessing Representative Institutions without Responsible Government, the Crown cannot as a general rule legislate by Order in Council, and laws are made by the Governor with the concurrence of one or two Legislative bodies, of which one at least is wholly or for the most part Representative.

In the following Colonies there are a Council and Assembly. The Council is nominated by the Crown, the Assembly elective:
   1. Bahamas.
   2. Barbados.
   3. Bermuda.

In the following there is a single Legislative Chamber partly elective, partly nominated by the Crown:
   *1. British Guiana.
   *2. Leeward Islands.
   *3. Malta.
   *4. Natal.
   *5. Western Australia.

In British Guiana and Malta the Crown has reserved the right to legislate by Order in Council, and in Natal has reserved the right to revoke or alter the Constitution. The legislature of British Guiana is peculiar, it being differently composed for ordinary legislation and for financial business.

4. Under Responsible Government the Executive Councillors are appointed by the Governor alone with reference to the exigencies of Representative Government, the other Public Officers by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council. In no appointments is the concurrence of the Home Government requisite.

The control of all public departments is thus practically placed in the hands of persons commanding the confidence of a representative Legislature. Hence such of the following regulations as relate to subordinate public officers have comparatively little application, except by way of example, to Colonies in which Responsible Government exists, which are the following:

| Province                  | Legislature                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Ontario                   | Single Elected Assembly          |
| Quebec                    | Council and Assembly             |
| New Brunswick             | Council and Assembly             |
| Nova Scotia               | Council and Assembly             |
| British Columbia          | Single Elected Chamber           |
| Prince Edward Island      | Council and Assembly             |
| Manitoba                  | Single Elected Assembly          |
| North West Territory      | Council                          |
| Turks Island              | Nominated Council                |

CHAPTER II.
THE GOVERNOR.

§ I. The different Classes of Governors, &c., the duration of their Office, &c.

5. The Officer appointed by the Crown to administer the Government of a Colony is usually styled Governor, or Governor and Commander-in-Chief, or Captain-General. The titles of Governor-in-Chief and Governor-General have been at different times given to Governors whose commissions have comprised several distinct Colonies.

6. A Governor-in-Chief administers the Government of every Colony comprised within his Command whenever he is present therein; but the administration of a Colony during his absence is intrusted to an officer appointed by the Crown, with the title of Lieutenant-Governor; or (in some cases) Administrator of the Government, or President of the Council.

The following are Governments in Chief:

1. The Dominion of Canada, which includes the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, N.-W. Territories, British Columbia, Vancouver's Island, and Prince Edward Island.

2. Jamaica, to which are attached,

Honduras.† Turks Islands.

3. The Windward Islands, composed of, || Barbados. Grenada. St. Vincent. Tobago. St. Lucia.

4. The Leeward Islands, composed of,

Antigua. Dominica. Virgin Islands.
St. Christopher's. Nevis. Montserrat.

5. The West Africa Settlements, composed of, ¶ Sierra Leone. Gambia. Gold Coast. Lagos.

7. Of these Officers, Governors are appointed under the Sign Manual and Signet. Every such person is appointed during Her Majesty's pleasure, but his tenure of office is as a rule confined to a period of six years from the assumption of his duties. If, through death, absence, or otherwise, he should become incapable of acting, the Government devolves on such Officer or person as may have been designated for that purpose in the Charter of Government or in the Letters Patent constituting the office of Governor.

8. By the Act 26 & 27 Vict. c. 76, it is enacted, that Letters Patent shall not take effect in any Colony until published there, and that appointments by Letters Patent shall become void unless so published within a specified period.

9. By the Act 1 Will. IV. c. 4, it is enacted, that all Patents, Commissions, or other Authorities for the exercise of offices in the Colonies held during pleasure, shall continue in force until the expiration of eighteen months from the demise of the Crown.

§ II. Authority of the Governor in relation to Her Majesty's Troops.

10. The Governor of a Colony, though bearing the title of Captain-General or Commander-in-Chief is not, without special appointment from Her Majesty, invested with the Command of Her Majesty's Regular Forces in the Colony. He is not therefore entitled to receive the Allowances annexed to that Command, or to take the immediate direction of any Military Operations, or except in case of urgent necessity, to communicate officially with subordinate Military Officers, without the concurrence of the Officer in Command of the Forces. Any such exceptional communication must be immediately notified to that Officer.

11. In the event of the Colony being invaded or assailed by a foreign enemy, and becoming the scene of active military operations, the officer in command of her Majesty's land forces assumes the entire military authority over the troops.

11A. In the event of armed insurrection occurring within the Colony, or of such general disturbances arising as to render military operations necessary, it will be the duty of the Governor to determine the objects with which, and the extent to which Her Majesty's troops are to be employed in their suppression. He will, therefore, issue to the officer in command of the forces instructions as definite as possible on these points. When military operations have been determined upon, and their object

† St. Kitts and Nevis are now united into one Presidency. (See Part II.)
‡ By Letters Patent dated the 2nd of October, 1884, British Honduras was constituted a separate Colony, with a Governor and Commander-in-Chief.
§ By Her Majesty's Charter of 17th March, 1885, Barbados was constituted a separate Government, and, as will be seen from Part II, Tobago has been united to Trinidad.
¶ By Her Majesty's Charter of the 24th of July, 1874, the Gold Coast and Lagos were separated from the West Africa Settlements, and formed a separate Colony, under the style of the Gold Coast Colony. By Charter dated 14th Jan., 1896, Lagos, and by Charter of Dec., 1898, Gambia, have been constituted separate Governments—(Ed. C. O. List).
and scope have been definitely decided, the responsibility for all details of their conduct will rest solely with the officer commanding the troops.

12. Except in the case of invasion or assault by a Foreign Enemy, or of the Colony becoming the scene of military operations, it is the duty of the Governor to determine the objects with which and the extent to which Her Majesty's Troops are to be employed. He will therefore issue to the Officer in Command of the Forces directions respecting their distribution and their employment on Escort and other duties required for the safety and welfare of the Colony.

12A. In all the matters referred to in the two last preceding regulations, the Governor will consult as far as possible with the Officer in Command, and will incur special responsibility, if he shall direct the Troops to be stationed or employed in a manner which that Officer shall consider open to Military objection.

13. The Governor, as the Queen's Representative, will give the "word" in all places within his Government.

14. On the other hand, the Officer in Command of the Forces will determine all Military details respecting the Distribution and Movement of the Troops and the composition of the different detachments, taking care that they are in conformity with the general directions issued to him by the Governor.

15. The Officer in Command of Her Majesty's Land Forces is alone charged with the superintendence of all details connected with the Military Department in a Colony, the Regimental duty and discipline of the Troops, inspections, and summoning and holding courts-martial, garrison or regimental, and the granting leave of absence to subordinate Military Officers.

16. He carries into execution, on his own authority, the Sentences of Courts-martial, excepting Sentences of Death, which must first be approved, on behalf of the Queen, by the Officer administering the Civil Government.

17. He makes the Officer administering the Civil Government Returns of the state and condition of the Troops of the Military departments, of the Stores, Magazines and Fortifications within the Colony and furnishes duplicates of all such Returns of this nature as he may be required or may see occasion to send to the Military Authorities at home, or to any Officer under whose general Command he is placed.

18. On the receipt of the Army (Annual) Act, the Officer in Command of Her Majesty's Land Forces communicates to the Civil Authority the "General Orders" in which it may be promulgated.

19. The above Regulations will hold good, though the Governor may be a Military Officer senior in rank to the Officer in Command of the Forces.

20. If several Colonies are comprised in one Military Command, the Officer in Command of the whole may transfer Troops from one Colony to another on an application from the Governor of the Colony to which the Troops are sent, transmitted to him either through the Governor of the Colony in which he is serving, or through the Officer commanding the Forces in the Colony for which Troops are required. But the Officer in command must in all cases consult with the Governor of the Colony from which the Troops are sent, and will incur a special responsibility if he sends them away without that Governor's consent.

21. For the purposes of the eleven last preceding regulations Colonies comprised under one Government in Chief are to be treated as a single Colony.

§ III. General Powers of an Officer appointed to conduct a Colonial Government.

22. The powers of every Officer, administering a Colonial Government, are conferred, and his duties for the most part defined in Her Majesty's Commission and the Instructions with which he is furnished. The following is a general outline of the nature of the powers with which he is invested, subject to the special law of each Colony:

23. He is empowered to grant a pardon or respite to any criminal convicted in the Colonial Courts of justice.

24. He may pardon persons imprisoned in Colonial Gaols under sentence of a Court-martial; but this is not to be done without consulting the Officer in command of the Forces.

25. He has in general the power of remitting any fines, penalties, or forfeitures, which may accrue to the Queen, but if the fine exceeds £50l., he is in some Colonies only at liberty to suspend the payment of it until Her Majesty's pleasure can be known.

26. The Moneys to be expended for the Public Service are issued under his Warrant, as the law may in each particular case direct.

27. The Governor of a Colony has usually the power of granting licenses for marriages, letters of administration, and probate of wills, unless other provision be made by Charter of Justice or local law. He has also, in many cases, the presentation to benefices of the Church of England in the Colony, subject to rules hereinafter laid down. (See Ch. 4, sec. 1, par. 81.)

28. He has the power, in the Queen's name, of issuing writs for the election of Representative Assemblies and Councils, of convoking and proroguing Legislative Bodies, and of dissolving those which are liable to dissolution.

29. He confers appointments to Offices within the Colony, either absolute, where warranted by local laws, or temporary and provisional, until a reference has been made to Her Majesty's Government.

30. In Colonies possessing responsible Government, he has, with his Council, the entire power of suspending or dismissing public servants who hold during pleasure. In other Colonies he has the power of suspending them from the exercise of their functions under certain regulations, which must be strictly observed, and a limited power of dismissal.

31. He is empowered to administer the appointed oaths to all persons, in Office or not, whenever he may think fit, and particularly the oath of Allegiance provided by 21 and 22 Vict. c. 48, s. 1.

32. He has the power of granting or withholding his assent to any Bills which may be passed by the Legislative bodies.

33. But he is required, in various cases, by his Instructions, to reserve such Bills for the Royal Assent, or to assent to them only with a clause suspending their operation until they are confirmed by the Crown. These cases are not defined alike in all Instructions; but they comprise, generally speaking, matters touching the Currency, the Army and Navy, Differential Duties, the effect of Foreign Treaties,
and any enactments of an unusual nature touching the Prerogative or the rights of Her Majesty's Subjects not resident in the Colony.

34. If anything should happen which may be for the advantage or security of the Colony, and is not provided for in the Governor's Commission and Instructions, he may take order for the present therein.

35. He is not to declare or make war against any foreign State, or against the subjects of any foreign State. Aggression he must at all times repel to the best of his ability; and he is to use his best endeavours for the suppression of piracy.

36. His attention is at all times to be directed to the state of discipline and equipment of Militia and Volunteers in the Colony, and when either Force may be embodied he should send home monthly Returns, with a particular account of their arms and accoutrements.

37. Periodical Reports on this subject, which may not call for immediate attention, may be included in the annual "Blue Book" hereinafter noticed.

38. He is on no account to absent himself from the Colony without Her Majesty's permission.

39. He is prohibited from receiving Presents, pecuniary or valuable, from the Inhabitants of the Colony, or any class of them, during the Continuance of his office, and from giving such Presents; and this Rule is to be equally observed on leaving his office.

40. In cases where money has been subscribed, with a view of marking public approbation of the Governor's conduct, it may be dedicated to objects of general utility and connected with the name of the person who has merited such a proof of the general esteem.

41. Governors are not, without special permission, to forward any articles for presentation to Her Majesty.

CHAPTER III.

§ I. Legislative Councils and Assemblies.

42. Legislative Councils nominated by the Crown consist, generally speaking, in part of the principal Executive Officers of the Colony, and in part of private persons appointed by name; the former being usually termed Official, and the latter, Unofficial Members. The proportions are prescribed by the respective charters or Commissions or Instructions to Governors.

43. The precedence of the Members of Council between themselves is regulated by the Royal Instructions. In some cases, that precedence depends on seniority of appointment alone, but in other cases that rule is qualified by assigning to the Official Members of Council precedence over the Unofficial Members.

44. When a vacancy occurs by the demise, resignation, &c., of a Legislative Councillor appointed by name, the Governor may in general appoint provisionally to such vacancy until Her Majesty's pleasure may be known.

45. The general rule is, that no Member of Council may, on pain of vacating his seat, absent himself for more than six months except by leave of the Governor, whose power is limited to granting a leave of absence in some cases of twelve, and in others of eighteen months. Any more protracted leave of absence must be granted by the Crown.

46. In the Colonies not having Representative Assemblies, the initiation of all laws belongs in general to the Governor.

47. In Colonies having such Assemblies it is in many cases provided by Local or Statute law that the initiation of all measures for the appropriation of public money shall belong to the Governor.

48. In every Colony the Governor has authority either to give or to withhold his assent to laws passed by the other branches or members of the Legislature, and until that assent is given no such law is valid or binding.

49. Laws are in some cases passed with suspending clauses; that is, although assented to by the Governor they do not come into operation or take effect in the Colony until they shall have been specially confirmed by Her Majesty, and in other cases Parliament has for the same purpose empowered the Governor to reserve Laws for the Crown's assent, instead of himself assenting or refusing his assent to them.

50. Every Law which has received the Governor's assent (unless it contains a suspending clause) comes into operation immediately or at the time specified in the Law itself. But the Crown retains power to disallow the Law; and if such power be exercised, the Law ceases to have operation from the date at which such disallowance is published in the Colony.

51. In Colonies having Representative Assemblies the disallowance of any Law, or the Crown's assent to a reserved Bill, is signified by Order in Council. The confirmation of an Act passed with a suspending clause, is not signified by Order in Council unless this mode of confirmation is required by the terms of the suspending clause itself, or by some special provision in the constitution of the Colony.

52. In Crown Colonies the allowance or disallowance of any Law is generally signified by despatch.

53. In some cases a period is limited, after the expiration of which Local Enactments, though not actually disallowed, cease to have the authority of law in the Colony, unless before the lapse of that time Her Majesty's confirmation of them shall have been signified there; but the general rule is otherwise.

54. In Colonies possessing Representative Assemblies, Laws purport to be made by the Queen or by the Governor on Her Majesty's behalf or sometimes by the Governor alone, omitting any express reference to Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Council and Assembly. They are almost invariably designated as Acts. In Colonies not having such Assemblies, Laws are designated as Ordinances, and purport to be made by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council (or in British Guiana of the Court of Policy).

55. In West Indian Islands or African Settlements which form part of any general Government, every Bill or Draft Ordinance must be submitted to the Governor-in-Chief before it receives the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor or Administrator. If the Governor-in-Chief shall consider any amendment indispensable, he may either require that amendment to be made before the law is brought into operation, or he may authorize the Officer administering to assent to the Bill or Draft on the express engagement of the Legislature to give effect to the Governor-in-Chief's recommendation by a supplementary Enactment.
§ II. The Executive Council.

56. The Executive Council (whether separate or not from the Legislative) has the general duty of assisting the Governor by its advice. In some cases, by local Enactment, he can only act with this advice; but, generally speaking, he is not absolutely precluded from acting without it if the public interest requires him to do so. But in this case he must conform to certain special Rules laid down in his Instructions; which likewise prescribe the course to be taken by Councillors in recording their opinion in opposition to the Governor's.

57. In Colonies possessing what is called Responsible Government the Governor is empowered by his Instructions to appoint and remove Members of the Executive Council, it being understood that Councillors who have lost the confidence of the local Legislature will tender their resignation to the Governor or discontinue the practical exercise of their functions in analogy with the usage prevailing in the United Kingdom.

58. In other Colonies the Executive Council when separate from the Legislative Council commonly consists of certain principal officers of the Local Government with or without an admixture of Unofficial Members.

59. These Councillors are appointed by the Governor's Instructions or by Warrant from the Crown, the Governor having in some cases the power of making provisional appointments, subject to the Crown's confirmation.

60. They may be dismissed by the Crown alone, but may be suspended by the Governor, following as far as the nature of the case will allow, his General Instructions as to the suspension of Public Officers.

61. In the West India Colonies possessing Representative Assemblies, the Councils in some cases possess, concurrently with the Governor, a judicial authority as a Court of Error, and in some cases they also audit the public accounts.

62. To the Executive Council, associated with the Chief Judge of the Colony, is also in general entrusted the duty of administering to the Governor, on his arrival, the usual oaths of office. Each new Member of Council, on his appointment, is also required to take the oaths applying to his particular case.

CHAPTER IV.

§ I. Appointments to Public Offices.

63. The regulations comprised in this Chapter are not intended to apply to Colonies under Responsible Government, in which appointments to Public Offices are made by the Governor with advice of his Executive Council, and are not authorized or confirmed by any Commission or Warrant from the Queen.

64. In other Colonies Public Offices are generally granted in the name of Her Majesty, and holden during Her Majesty's Pleasure. In some cases, however, it is specially provided by law that they shall be granted by the Governor or by the Governor in Council or by some judicial authority, and in some few cases they are holden during good behaviour.

65. The general rule is, that all Public Offices of considerable rank, trust, and emolument, should be granted by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony in Her Majesty's name. The appointment may be made either provisionally, when the Instrument is issued under authority of Her Majesty's general instructions and subject to the Royal approval, or absolutely, when the Instrument is issued in pursuance of Her Majesty's special instructions, which special instructions are conveyed to the Governor through one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and, when prescribed by the Queen's Letters Patent or Instructions, or by local law or other authority in the form of Warrants under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet.

66. The distinction between Offices which are, and Offices which are not, of considerable rank, trust, and emolument, being in itself vague and indefinite, has been rendered as precise as the nature of the case admits, by the following distinction. Offices are classed under three heads:—1, those of which the emoluments do not exceed one hundred pounds per annum; 2, those of which the emoluments exceed one hundred and do not exceed two hundred pounds per annum; 3, and those of which the emoluments exceed two hundred pounds per annum.*

67. When a vacancy occurs in the first or lowest of the three classes last mentioned, the Governor, as a general rule, has the absolute disposal of the appointment, subject only to the condition of reporting every such appointment by the first opportunity.†

68. When a vacancy occurs in the second or middle class, the Governor reports it to the Secretary of State, together with the name and qualifications of the person whom he has appointed to fill it provisionally and intends to fill it finally, which recommendation is almost uniformly followed.

69. When a vacancy occurs in the third or highest class, the Governor follows the same course as to reporting the vacancy and provisional appointment; but he is distinctly to apprise the object of his choice that he holds the Office in the strictest sense of the word provisionally only until his appointment is confirmed or superseded by Her Majesty. He is at liberty also to recommend a candidate for the final appointment, but it must be distinctly understood that the Secretary of State has the power of recommending another instead. In these cases the confirmation or other final appointment takes place in the form already mentioned.

70. It is of course impossible to lay down any general rule for deciding in what cases the recommendation of a Governor will, or will not, be ultimately sanctioned and confirmed by the Queen; but in general it may be stated, that Her Majesty will be advised to regard more favourably appointments which are in the nature of promotions of meritorious Public Servants, than appointments made in favour of persons new to the Public Service; and that when any new Office has been created the Governor's recommendation for filling it up will carry with it less weight than in the case of offices

* In Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, and Labuan, the limits are not £100 or £200, or their equivalents, but £600 and £1,200; and in Ceylon and Mauritius, Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 3,000.

† See subsequent regulations 247 and 248 as to reporting vacancies.—(Circular, 4th August, 1881.)
which the Governor may have found already established. In the cases of such new Offices there will always be more than usual reason to anticipate that an appointment will be made directly from this country.

71. Appointments of gentlemen connected with the Governor, or who have accompanied him to the Colony as Private Secretaries or otherwise, are open to much objection, and will rarely be confirmed. Provisional appointments of this kind should be reported to the Secretary of State without any recommendation as to the mode in which the Office shall be permanently filled. Should such an appointment be made at a time when a Governor is about leave the Colony, his Successor will be expected to report on the mode in which the Office should be permanently filled.

72. It is further to be understood, that, in determining the propriety of appointments from this country or from the Colony, regard will probably be had to the comparatively advanced state of wealth and population in each Colony, and to the number of properly qualified Candidates among whom the Local Authorities may have the opportunity of making a selection.

73. In the distribution of the patronage of the Government in the Colonies, great weight must always be attached to local services and experience. Every Governor will therefore make, once in each year, a Confidential Report of the claims of Candidates, whether already employed in the Public Service or not, whom he may consider to possess those qualifications, in order that, when a vacancy or an opportunity for promotion occurs, the Secretary of State may have before him additional means, besides the immediate recommendation of the Governor, for judging how far the particular Candidate recommended by the Governor is on the whole the best qualified, and whether a Candidate of proper qualifications is to be found in that or in any other Colony. The Governor will ascertain and report upon the qualifications of other Candidates, of whom he may have less knowledge, when he sees sufficient reason for supposing that the Public Service might gain by their admission into it; but in the application of these Rules much must be left to the Governor's discretion.

74. In reporting a vacancy in any Office under the Crown, of which the emoluments exceed 200l.* per annum, or in reporting the creation of any such office, the Governor will furnish in the form of the Schedule inserted in the Appendix (p. 359), and in duplicate, full particulars respecting the nature and incidents of the office, and will state in the covering despatch whether persons filling that or similar offices have been usually selected by the Secretary of State or by the Governor.

75. In the case of the Chief Judicial and Chief Fiscal Offices in a Colony in which the Crown is responsible for the appointments, local connexion with the Colony by birth, family ties, or otherwise, will be considered, generally speaking, to render a candidate ineligible.

76. All salaried Public Officers are prohibited from engaging in trade or connecting themselves with any commercial undertaking without leave from the Governor approved by the Secretary of State. As a general rule this prohibition will be made absolute in the case of officers whose remuneration is fixed on the assumption that their whole time is at the disposal of the Government. No officer on leave of absence or on vacation leave is permitted to accept any employment without previously obtaining the express sanction of the Governor or of the Secretary of State.

77. No Public Officer is to undertake any private agency in any matter connected with the exercise of his public duties.

78. Whenever half-pay Officers borne on the half-pay of Her Majesty's Army or Navy, or in the Military and Commissariat Departments, shall be appointed to a civil situation in any of the Colonies, a report of the appointment, specifying the date and the amount of salary, is to be made immediately to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, which will be transmitted by him to the proper authorities in this Country. Promotions in the Civil Service of half-pay Officers are also to be notified forthwith to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the information of the respective authorities.

79. No paid officer under the Government of a Colony can be permitted to be the editor of a newspaper, or to take any active part in the management of it. He may furnish articles signed with his name upon objects of general interest, abstaining from writing on questions which can properly be called political, or discussing the measures of the Government, or the official proceedings of its Officers, and from furnishing any articles whatever to a newspaper which, in commenting on the measures of the Government, should habitually exceed the bounds of fair and temperate discussion. If the authorship of anonymous articles should be brought home to any Officer, or if, in articles bearing his signature, he should discuss any political subject, or the measures of the Government, or the official proceedings of its Officers, he will be liable to be removed from Office.

80. No Public Officer is allowed to receive a Grant of money by a Colonial Legislature, if such Grant has not been initiated or authorised by the Governor.

§ II. Suspension and Dismissal from Office.

81. Holders of patent offices may be removed from such offices by the Governor and Council under the second section of the Act 22 Geo. 3., c. 75, but care must be taken that the officer is heard after being apprised of the charge against him, and it will be convenient that the course prescribed in case of suspension should be pursued in any proceedings for removal.

82. Against any such removal an appeal lies to Her Majesty in Council, which should be prosecuted like any other appeal.

83. The following Rules, unless the mode of suspension is otherwise provided for by some local law, must be strictly observed in proceeding to suspend from the exercise of his office any public officer who has been appointed by virtue of a commission or warrant from the Crown, or whose emoluments exceed 100l.* a year.

84. The Governor shall signify to the officer, by a statement in writing, the grounds of the intended suspension, and shall call upon him to state in writing before a day to be specified (which day must allow a reasonable interval for the purpose) any grounds upon which he relies to exculpate himself.

85. If the officer does not furnish such statement within the time fixed by the Governor, or if he fails to exculpate himself to the satisfaction of the Governor, the Governor shall apprise the officer that on a day (to be specified), the question of his suspension will be brought before the Executive

* See Footnote to Regulation 68.
Council, and that he will be allowed, and, if the Council so determine, required to appear before the Council and defend himself orally.

86. If any witnesses are examined by the Council, the officer must be allowed the opportunity of being present, and of putting questions on his own behalf. The officer must also be given a copy of any documentary evidence that is to be used against him, and that has not been already furnished to him.

87. If in the course of the inquiry further grounds of suspension are disclosed, the Governor, if he thinks fit to proceed upon such grounds, shall furnish the officer with a written statement thereof, and shall take the same steps as are above prescribed in respect of the original grounds of suspension.

88. If in any case the Governor considers that the interests of the public service require that an officer should cease to exercise the powers and functions of his office (as, for instance, in the custody of public money) instantly, or before the proceedings above prescribed can be completed, he may at once interdict the officer from the exercise of the powers and functions of his office. The Governor shall in all cases allow the interdicted officer to receive half the salary of his office, until proceedings for his suspension have been taken, and may in special cases allow a larger amount not exceeding the full salary; but no such officer can be formally suspended from his office or deprived of his whole salary, except upon formal proceedings as are above prescribed, which must in all cases be taken with as little delay as possible.

89. If upon the inquiry the Executive Council are of opinion that the officer deserves punishment, but not the full penalty of suspension, the Governor may remove the officer to an office of lower rank in the service, or may require him to serve in his original office at a reduced salary, either permanently or for a stated period, or may deduct a portion of salary due or about to become due to the officer.

90. If the officer is suspended or otherwise punished as above mentioned, the Governor shall, without loss of time, report the matter to the Secretary of State for approval and confirmation, transmitting the minutes of Council, the written statements, and all material documents relating to the case. If the officer is suspended, the Governor shall at the same time transmit the usual return required in the case of a vacancy. (A form will be found in the Appendix, p. 329.)

91. If the officer is suspended, the Secretary of State, instead of confirming the suspension, may direct the Governor to subject the officer to one of the lesser punishments above mentioned; or if, in lieu of suspension, the officer has been so punished by the Governor, the Secretary of State may direct the Governor to reduce or to increase the punishment already awarded.

92. If the suspension of an officer is not approved and confirmed by the Secretary of State, and no other punishment is awarded, the officer will be entitled to the full amount of salary which he would have received if he had not been suspended, even though the officer discharging the functions of the office in the meanwhile has been allowed to receive some portion of the salary of the office.

93. If the suspension is approved and confirmed by the Secretary of State, all salary will cease from the day of suspension; and although the officer should be subsequently restored (as an act of indulgence), he will not be entitled to any portion of salary during the period of his suspension. Pending the decision the Secretary of State the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, may grant a small alimentary allowance to an officer who has been suspended, and who appears urgently to need such assistance.

94. An officer whose suspension is approved and confirmed by the Secretary of State forfeits all claim to a retiring allowance, even though he should have paid contributions towards such allowance.

95. If criminal proceedings are instituted against a public officer, proceedings for his suspension upon any grounds involved in the criminal charge shall not be taken pending the criminal proceedings.

96. If an officer is convicted on a criminal charge the Governor may cause the proceedings of the Criminal Court on such charge to be laid before the Executive Council, and if the Council are of opinion that the officer should be suspended on account of the offence for which he has been convicted, he may thereupon be suspended without taking any of the proceedings above prescribed, but his suspension must be reported to the Secretary of State for approval and confirmation.

96. (a) An officer acquitted on a criminal charge is not thereby rendered exempt from suspension on account of his conduct in the matter; and the Governor, if he thinks fit, may take the usual proceedings for the purpose.

96. (b) An officer who is under suspension may not leave the Colony, during the interval before he is reinstated or dismissed, without the leave of the Governor. If granted leave of absence the officer will not be entitled to any more salary than if he had remained in the Colony.

96. (c) Any officer, whether under suspension or not, who absents himself from the Colony without leave, will be held to have thereby vacated his office.

96. (d) An officer who has not been appointed by virtue of a commission or warrant from the Crown and whose emoluments do not exceed £100.* a year, may be dismissed by the Governor without the proceedings above prescribed; but in every such case the grounds of dismissal must be definitely stated in writing, and communicated to the officer, that he may have full opportunity of exculpating himself, and the matter must be investigated by the Governor with the aid of the head of the department (if any). In lieu of dismissal the Governor, if he thinks fit, may remove the officer to an office of lower rank in the service, or may require him to serve in his original office at a reduced salary, either permanently or for a stated period, or may deduct a portion of salary due, or about to become due, to the officer. Such dismissal or other punishment will not require the confirmation of the Secretary of State, but any memorial from the dismissed officer must be forwarded to the Secretary of State without delay, with a short statement of the grounds of dismissal or other punishment.

§ III. Pensions and Retiring Allowances.†

97. In the absence of any local law, each application for a pension or retiring allowance as it presents itself must be specially considered and treated on its own merits. Except in the case of Officers appointed prior to 5th August, 1829, the amount of pension to be granted, if any, will be generally regulated by the principles of the British Superannuation Acts, § & W. 4, c. 24, and 22 Vict. c. 26. But it must be clearly understood that the maximum rate of pension is not always awarded, and that

* See footnote to Regulation 66.
† In Jamaica no pensions are granted to officers appointed since the passing of Law 34 of 1886.—(Ed. C.O.L.)
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

When public employment is combined with the practice of a private profession, no pension will be granted, unless the retiring Officer had acquired a claim to Superannuation before the passing of the Act 22 Vict. c. 26, or had had his right to a pension otherwise and specially preserved. The cases of Officers having had private practice, whose services commenced after the passing of the Act 22 Vict. c. 26, and whose appointments may be abolished, will be specially considered.

98. Whenever a Governor may have occasion to bring under the consideration of Her Majesty's Government the application of any Officer for a retiring allowance on quitting the public service, he is required to furnish certain particulars in each case, according to the form inserted in the Appendix (p. 359). (An extract of the Treasury Minute, and of a Report of Superannuation Committee, respecting the grant of retiring allowances to those who entered the service prior to 5th August, 1829, to those who entered it after that date, to professional Officers, and in regard to pensions granted on abolition of office, are printed at pp. 225-26 of the edition for 1881.)

99. In case of Public Officers receiving salaries not exceeding £120 per annum, the Governor, subject to revision by the Home Government, may decide on the amount of retiring allowance to be granted, in accordance with the general rules relating to pensions.*

100. Pensions to Colonial Officers retiring on the ground of ill-health are subject as a general rule to this condition, that should the Officer's health be re-established, he is bound to accept, in lieu of his pension, any office, not inferior in value to that from which he retired, which the Secretary of State may think proper to confer on him, due regard being had to circumstances of climate.

101. Previously to making any payment in a Colony in respect of a pension, the Treasurer, or other proper Officer, will take care to inform himself whether any condition may have been attached to it, with reference to the employment, residence, or otherwise, of the claimant. If such condition shall exist, the Treasurer will have to produce as a voucher, in support of his account, a sufficient certificate or other proof that it has been complied with, and must withhold the payment of the pension until such document shall be furnished.

102. If an Officer shall in any case retire on a pension, during a leave of absence, or within six months after resumption of duty, the term of service on which his pension is calculated will be subject to such deduction, not exceeding the duration of his last leave, as the Secretary of State may think fit.

103. If in any Colony the law of the Colony shall vest in the retiring Officer an unconditional right to the pension claimed, or is otherwise inconsistent with these rules, the case must of course be governed by the law and not by the rule. (See Circular of 22nd May, 1873, as to mode of dealing for pension purposes with the house allowances and fees of public officers, in Part IV of the edition for 1881.)

CHAPTER V.

§ I. Salaries.

104. On appointments to Offices, half salary, when so disposable by law, will be allowed, as a general rule, from the date of embarkation and full salary from the date of arrival in the Colony: Provided that the Officer proceeds direct to the Colony to which he is appointed, otherwise he will be allowed to draw half salary for such time only as ordinarily elapses between the departure of the mail (if any) from the point of embarkation and its arrival in the Colony; or if there be no mail route between his point of embarkation and his point of arrival in the Colony, for such time as is ordinarily required to perform the journey between such two points.

105. If, however, the Office is a new one, or if for any other reason there is no person drawing salary in respect of it, full salary may in special cases be allowed from the date of embarkation. If, on the other hand, the Officer previously holding the appointment in the Colony continues in the tenure of his Office until the arrival of his Successor, the latter Officer will not be entitled to any portion of salary until he has assumed the duties of his Office.

106. No advance of salary is allowed to Officers either on first appointment or on leave of absence, except in very special cases, to be determined by the Secretary of State; and the Officers to whom it may be granted must sign an agreement with the Crown Agents in the form inserted in the Appendix. (Page 361.) Collateral security will be required when the advance exceeds a month's salary.

107. If any Office be vacated, in any Colony, by the death or removal of the holder, or by his temporary absence, the person appointed by the Governor to act in his stead will receive half the salary of the Office. Should such person be the holder of another situation, but not performing the duties of it, he may receive half the salary of the Office in which he is so appointed to act, together with half the salary of his own Office.

108. Should the person so appointed by the Governor to a vacant Office be required at the same time to perform the duties of his own Office, he may be allowed half the salary of the temporary Office, together with the whole salary of his own Office; but as a general rule no person should be appointed to discharge at the same time the duties of two distinct Offices, whenever any other arrangement may be practicable; and unless the Offices are distinct and separate Offices in different Departments of the service, or Offices not standing to one another in any intimate relation of superiority and subordination, such as two Police Magistracies, only half salary of each Office can be allowed.

109. The fees of the vacant Office (in the absence of any usage or law to the contrary) should be paid into the Colonial Treasury, from whence the acting Officer will receive one moiety, with such further portion as the Governor shall consider advisable, in case the services performed are of a special character or involve outlay.

110. Should the Officer whom the Governor has appointed temporarily to a vacant Office be confirmed in the situation, he will be entitled to draw the full salary of that Office from the date at which he entered on the duties, if no portion of the salary during that period has been drawn by the former occupant of the Office; but from the date from which he draws such full salary, he will not be entitled to salary on account of any other Office which he may have held at the same time.

111. If any Colonial Officer desires part of his salary to be paid by the Crown Agents in this country,

* In Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, and Labuan, the limit is not £120, or its equivalent, but £720, and in Ceylon and Mauritius, Rs. 1,800.
he must give his assent in writing to the following condition, viz., that the proposed part payment shall in no case be made until the Crown Agents have been furnished with a certificate from the proper Colonial authority to the effect that the Officer continued to hold his appointment during the period for which such part payment is claimed.*

112. The Colonial Government, on timely application from the Officer, is to transmit such a certificate to the Crown Agents, furnishing the Officer with a duplicate.*

113. The following Rules are to be observed in regard to the salary to be drawn by Officers appointed to the provisional administration of Governments, or transferred from one Government to another:—

Whenever the Government of a Colony may be vacated by the death, recall, or resignation of the holder of it, or when the Governor may be absent on leave, the person succeeding to the administration of the Government shall (if previously resident in the Colony) receive half of the salary of the Governor; and the full "Table Allowance," in cases where any such allowance is made.

Should any Officer in the Civil Service of a Colony be called to administer the Government of a Colony in either of the aforesaid cases, he will (if no other arrangement has been made and sanctioned on his assumption of the Government) be entitled to receive only the Governor's half salary, and no part of his own salary, unless the Governor's half salary should be less than double his own whole salary, in which case he will receive half of each.

Should the person called to the administration have been removed from the Public Service in another Colony for the purpose, he shall receive, during a vacancy of the Government to which he shall so have been called, and until the embarkation of his Successor, the whole salary of the Governor; and "Table Allowance," as above stated.

But during the period in which he may continue to administer such Government, on whole salary, he will not be entitled to any portion of the salary of the Office from which he may have been removed; and from the period at which the newly-appointed Governor shall become entitled to half salary, the Officer provisionally administering shall receive only the other half; and "Table Allowance," as above stated. Whether he can in this case draw also half the salary of his own Office will depend on the arrangements made for payment of his substitute, and will be decided in each instance by the Secretary of State.

Should a Government be vacant by reason of the absence on leave of the Governor (who would then be entitled to half salary), and should an Officer administering some other Government be called to the provisional administration of the Government so temporarily vacant, such officer will be entitled to draw the half salary of the Government from which he may have so temporarily removed, together with the half salary of the Government which he may have been called provisionally to administer; and "Table Allowance," as above stated.

If the period of a vacancy, or of the absence of a Governor, should exceed nine months, and there should be any salary left for the purpose, the Secretary of State will be willing to make such arrangements as may appear reasonable for the increase of the salary of the temporary holder for the period of excess.

Officers in the provisional administration of Colonial Governments must, however, in all cases in which bills are drawn on the Paymaster-General, draw for the half salaries only of such Governments until they shall receive Notifications from the Colonial Office of the periods during which they may be entitled to full salary.

113A. Officers succeeding to the administration, or the provisional administration, of Colonial Governments, will be entitled to draw full or half salary, as the case may be, in respect of the day on which they assume their duties. The Officers whom they succeed will not be entitled to any payment for that day, excepting the half salary granted in cases of absence on leave.

114. If a Governor is transferred from one Colony to another, and comes to England first, he will usually receive the half salary of the Government which he relinquishes if it should be available, and not drawn by any other Officer, until the date of his embarkation from England for the Government to which he may be appointed.

115. If no portion of the salary of the Government from which such Governor is transferred is so available, but the half salary of the Government to which he may be appointed is available, he will usually receive the half salary of the latter.

116. If no half salary is available from either, he can receive no salary until he assumes his new Government.

117. When a Governor who has been transferred from one Government to another returns to this country, before proceeding to his new Government, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that such return is unavoidable, or in furtherance, of the public interests, before the Officer is allowed to receive any half salary. (See also circular of 8th January, 1873, as to the division of salary on the occasion of a change in the office of Governor.)

§ II. Leave of Absence (See Cir. 21, Dec., 1886†).

118. The Act of Parliament, 22 Geo. 3, cap. 75, empowers the Governor and Council of any Colony to grant leave of absence to Colonial Officers, and the Act 57 and 58 Vict., cap. 17, regulates the conditions as to such leave.

119. Subject to the necessities of the service leave of absence may be granted after a period of six years' resident service in the Colony without any special grounds. It may be given before the expiration of that period in cases of serious indisposition, or of "urgent private affairs," if the Governor and Council are satisfied that the indulgence is indispensable. In cases of serious indisposition the state of the officer's health must be certified by his medical attendant. In cases of "urgent private affairs," the nature of such urgent affairs must be stated to the Governor.

* As to the mode of making such remittances through the Crown Agents, and the Forms to be used, see Circular Despatch of 7th April, 1880.

† In the case of Malta and Gibraltar rules 119-132 do not apply to officers appointed after 1889, and the rules of Home Civil service as to sick leave are substituted. Officers appointed before 1889 were allowed the option of coming under either system.—(Ed. C.O. List.)
120. In the absence of special grounds the leave in such case must not exceed one-sixth of the Officer's resident service. On special grounds it may exceed that period by six months, but it must in neither case exceed twelve months.

121. The Governor may report to the Secretary of State the period for which the leave may be extended without injury to the public service, but must not recommend such extension. The Officer seeking an extension must apply at least one clear month before the time when he ought to start in order to reach the Colony before the end of his existing leave.

122. Governors are required to report to the Secretary of State, each case in which leave of absence has been granted; they must also transmit a Certificate in the form inserted in the Appendix (p. 361), and a similar Certificate in case the Governor should afterwards recommend an extension of leave. If the Officer is paid by fees, they must also report what arrangements are made respecting the disposal of those fees during the Officer's absence.

123. An Officer to whom leave of absence has been granted, is in general entitled to half salary during his absence from the Colony. Any private arrangement made with the object of securing to the absent Officer more than the authorised allowance is on no account to be allowed.

123A. When an Officer receives, in addition to the salary of his appointment, an allowance granted to himself personally, and not permanently attached to his office, he should, when absent on half-pay leave, draw only the half of such personal allowance, the remaining moiety of the allowance being left undrawn and lapsing to the Colonial Treasury.

124. Officers on leave may receive so much of their allowance for house rent as may not be wanted for the Acting Officers, the amount so allowed being reported to the Secretary of State; but they must receive no part of their allowance for horse hire.

125. Governors are to furnish every Officer proceeding on leave of absence with a duplicate of the Certificate above mentioned; and an absent Officer must produce such Certificate to the Crown Agents for the Colonies in order to receive his salary. A third copy of the Certificate should be transmitted by the Colonial Government direct to the Crown Agents for the Colonies when the Officer's salary is to be paid through them, with instructions to issue the salary accordingly, as it becomes due.

126. The Regulations respecting the stoppage of half the salaries of Civil officers on obtaining leave of absence are to be applied, as far as practicable, to the case of Ministers of Religion in the Colonies, receiving salary from Colonial or Imperial Funds. Leave in these cases is to be granted by the Governor of the Colony on the recommendation of the Bishop or other superintending Authority (if any) of the Body to which the Minister may belong, and subject to the same rules as in the case of Civil Officers in regard to the confirmation and extension.

127. To whatever extent the authority of the Queen, or of Her Majesty's Officers may be competent to enforce it, the further rule must be observed, that no Minister of Religion must be permitted to absent himself from the Colony in which he serves, until adequate and satisfactory provision shall have been made for the performance of his clerical duties during his absence, unless the state of his health absolutely requires it.

128. The same rules extend to leave of absence granted to Judicial Functionaries of every Class.

129. In cases where salaries are fixed by law, the rule as to half salary can always be applied by the Governor's declining to grant the leave unless on condition of conforming to it.

130. On arriving in this country the Officer on leave must report his arrival by letter to the Colonial Office, mentioning the place of his residence, and he must similarly notify any subsequent change of residence. Treasurers and auditors of colonies, whose accounts are subject to Imperial audit, should also send their address to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. (Enclosure to circular despatch of the 30th November, 1880.)

131. Leave of absence will be extended by the Secretary of State, but not as a matter of course, nor unless the public convenience admits of it.*

132. Except in very special cases, as of unbroken official residence in the same Colony for fifteen years no extensions will exceed six months at a time, nor will any officers on leave be allowed to receive half salary at any one time for more than the following periods:

- Heligoland and Mediterranean: 9 months
- West Indies, Bermuda, Western Australia, British Columbia, Natal, St. Helena, and Falkland Islands: 18 "
- West Coast of Africa, Mauritius, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Straits Settlements, and Labuan: 24 "

Nor for a period which, added to his previous absences on leave with half salary, would exceed by six months one-sixth of his resident service in the Colony. Absence without salary will not be counted against him in calculating his claim for further leave of absence nor for him with certain exceptions, in calculating his pension.

133. The foregoing regulations are not designed to prevent, or to regulate, any vacation for the purpose of relaxation from business, not exceeding, in the case of ordinary Civil Officers, three months in any two years. In the case of Judicial or Educational Officers, the vacation leave may extend to, but must not exceed, the ordinary vacations of the court to which they belong, or the institution in which they are employed; and they may, when absent on half-pay leave receive full pay during any ordinary vacation of such court or institution which may be included in the period of their leave of absence. In Colonies where there is no ordinary vacation of the court or no vacation exceeding one month at one time, Judicial Officers may have the leave allowed to ordinary Civil Officers. Vacation leave need not be reported to the Secretary of State unless the officer intends or is likely to visit England, in which case his departure must be reported as required when leave of absence is granted. There is no abatement of salary during vacation leave; but the leave must be recorded under the Governor's

* In Ceylon, except in cases of unforeseen emergency, extension of leave will be refused when the Governor has notified that it cannot conveniently be granted; and in the case of application for extension on other grounds than that of ill-health half salary will not be granted without a reference to the Colony.—(Secretary of State's Despatch, 196, 14th Nov., 1867.)

Note.—Special advantages as to leave of absence are granted to Officers on the West Coast of Africa. See Chapter XVIII of these Regulations.
hand, and the officer absenting himself must, with the concurrence or sanction of the Governor, have made such arrangements as may be necessary for the adequate discharge of his duties without cost to the public.

134. In cases where an Officer is entitled to claim both vacation leave of six weeks or three months and also leave on half-pay for a longer period, and comes home by permission of the Governor on vacation leave, he may apply for an additional leave of absence on half-pay, to be taken immediately on the expiration of the vacation leave, subject to the usual rules which regulate such absence, and on condition that before leaving the Colony the Officer has informed the Governor of his intention to apply for such extended leave, and that the Governor has reported to the Secretary of State his approval of such intention, and has furnished the usual certificate of leave of absence; or the Governor may give the officer leave of absence for a period not exceeding that allowed by Regulation 120, with an intimation that he will be entitled to full pay for the period for his vacation leave, and subsequently to half-pay.

135. Officers applying for leave with the intention of retiring must only receive such term of leave as will allow time for coming to a decision in England respecting the application for retirement; and the Governor giving leave under such circumstances must report them to the Secretary of State. The Officer's half-salary will in such case cease and his pension commence when his retirement is sanctioned.

136. If an Officer retires during his leave of absence without having originally given notice of his desire to do so, the period at which his half-salary is to cease must be determined according to the circumstances of the case.*

§ III. Passages.

137. The following is the scale of allowances to be granted from Imperial Funds to Governors, including in that term all Officers administering Colonial Governments, where appointed for the usual term of years, for their passages from this country:†

| Country                  | Allowance |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Canada                   | £100      |
| Newfoundland             | 300       |
| Bermuda                  | 350       |
| British Honduras         | 300       |
| West Indies: Governors   | 350       |
| Lieutenants-Governors    | 250       |
| Administrators           | 200       |
| Malta                    | 300       |
| Gibraltar                | 200       |
| Cyprus                   | 400       |
| Sierra Leone             | 300       |
| Gambia                   | 250       |
| Gold Coast               | 300       |
| Lagos                    | 300       |
| Cape of Good Hope        | £500      |
| Natal                    | 450       |
| St. Helena               | 300       |
| Mauritius                | 700       |
| Seychelles               | 400       |
| Ceylon                   | 700       |
| Australian Colonies      | 800       |
| New Zealand              | 800       |
| Hong Kong                | 800       |
| Straits Settlements      | 800       |
| Falkland Islands         | 400       |
| Fiji                     | 800       |
| British New Guinea       | 800       |

138. Governors will be granted the same amount of passage allowance on retiring or being removed from their Governments, but they must not draw for the amount without the previous sanction of the Secretary of State; if, however they come home on leave of absence, or are relieved at their own request, before the period at which a successor would, under ordinary circumstances, be appointed, they must provide their own passages. The return allowances of Governors, who may have left this country, before the 1st January, 1879, will be governed by the Regulations which were in force at the time of their leaving.

139. If a Governor is removed from one Government to another, he will not be entitled to passage allowance from the Colony from which he retires to this country, and likewise from hence to the Colony to which he is about to proceed, unless the Secretary of State and the Treasury shall be satisfied that his return to this country was unavoidable, or in furtherance of the public interests; but the allowance to be granted to him will be calculated by the Secretary of State and the Treasury according to the probable expense of the direct passage from one Colony to the other, estimated on the same principle as the passage allowance from England. In the case of a public functionary (not a Governor) or other person resident in a Colony, who may be appointed to the Government of another Colony, the same principle will be followed by the Secretary of State and the Treasury as nearly as circumstances will admit. In the case of a Governor who may return to this country for other reasons than those above stated, he will be entitled to the single passage allowance from England to his new Colony, unless that allowance be greater than the sum which might have been allowed for a direct journey from the old Colony to the new one, in which case the smaller amount only will be allowed.

140. Cancelled by Circular of 3rd July, 1888.

141. Passage allowances will also be made from Imperial Funds to persons specially commissioned to proceed to any of the Colonies, and to Bishops receiving salaries from Imperial Funds, while on their Visitation Tours. When a Bishop's stipend ceases to be paid from Imperial Funds, his passage allowances will also cease.

142. No passage in Her Majesty's ships is to be given to Colonial Officers at the public expense except on the application of the Senior Officer of the Civil Department on the spot to the Senior Naval Officer present. The expense for the entertainment of passengers will not be paid by the public, unless the Secretary of State for the Colonies should consider that the passage was properly applied for, and that the expense should be so paid. Whenever a Governor has occasion to apply to the Senior Naval Officer for a passage in one of Her Majesty's Ships for himself, or for any Functionary under his Government, he must immediately report the case to the Secretary of State, informing him at the same time of the circumstances under which the application was made.

* By Circular Despatches of 30th March, 1881, and 7th May, 1883, Officers administering Governments in West Indies are allowed leave of absence on full pay for a period not exceeding six weeks in one year, or three months leave of absence in two years on half-pay, and by Despatch of 1st January, 1885, the Governors of Barbados, British Guiana, Jamaica, Leeward, Windward Islands and Trinidad, may, with permission of the Secretary of State, have full pay leave to visit other British West Indian Colonies not exceeding four weeks at one time or in one year.

† A sum of £300 is granted as passage allowance in all cases of the transfer of a Governor from an Australian Colony to New Zealand, or vice versa.
143. The passage expenses of a Governor-in-Chief visiting his subordinate Governments, will be defrayed from Imperial Funds; but not so his expenses while visiting different ports within his immediate Government.

144. If a Governor is proceeding on a Tour of Inspection or Duty within the limits of his Government, such passages must be limited to himself, his Secretary, and their personal attendants, and not include other Officers, or members of his family.

145. When a Governor or other Officer is proceeding to another Colony to administer the Government temporarily, or returning therefrom, he will be allowed, from Imperial Funds, such expense as the Secretary of State may deem to have been reasonably incurred for the removal of himself and his family.

146. Subject to Article 149, the expense for the entertainment on board of Her Majesty's Ships of a Governor, Bishop, or any other Public Officer so entertained, must be paid to the Paymaster of the Ship at the end of the voyage, and, if possible, before leaving the Ship.

147. If such expense is to be charged on the Imperial or Colonial Treasury, it may be defrayed by a Bill drawn in the former case on the Paymaster-General, and in the latter case on the Colonial Government. Such Bills must be drawn at not less than ten days' sight, either by the Governor or with his written sanction. In case the expense is to be borne on Imperial Funds, the Governor will report, by the first opportunity, his having given such sanction, and will direct the Public Officer to whom it may have been given to transmit an immediate and direct advice to the Secretary of State of his having drawn the Bill, and to forward at the same time the Governor's sanction for his having done so, and a Receipt from the Paymaster of the vessel for the amount so drawn.

148. The rates at which passages in Her Majesty's ships will be paid to the Captains or Commanding Officers at whose table passengers may be entertained, are as follows:

I. For any Governor whose salary is not less than £3,000 per annum, exclusive of allowances—and for Commanders-in-Chief of Forces, if Generals, Lieutenant-Generals, or Major Generals, 4l. per diem for the seven days, and afterwards 2ls. a day.

II. For any other Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, 3l. per diem for the first seven days and afterwards 2ls. a day.

III. For the persons composing the suite of Governors, &c., 2ls. a day for each male person above the age of 16; two-thirds of that sum for every female above 16; one-third for such of either sex as shall be between the ages of 7 and 16; and one-fourth for such as may be under 7 years of age, for every day they shall be entertained at the Captain's table.

IV. For Colonial Bishops, and for individuals other than those above stated, entertained at the Captain's table, 2ls. a day for the first fourteen days, and 15s. a day afterwards; and the proportions with respect to age and sex, as stated in the preceding paragraph.

149. When a Governor or other Public Officer is proceeding in a ship of war on a Tour of Inspection, which requires him to disembark at various ports, the higher rate per diem will in general only be paid for the seven days' entertainment following his first embarkation. If there are special reasons for repeating this payment, it must form a subject of special representation to the Secretary of State before it is made.

149A. When a Governor, or other public officer, disembarks for the purpose of performing bona fide public service, and has not been able to give the Captain or Commanding Officer beforehand such information as to the days on which he would be absent from the ship as would prevent expense in preparing for his entertainment on those days, one-half of the rates of allowance above authorized will be payable in respect of such absence.

149B. For the purpose of computing the seven days referred to in Clause 149, each day in respect of which a charge for entertainment is made at half of the higher rate is to be counted as a full day. (See Circular, 21st June, 1880.)

150. Payment for entertainment in Her Majesty's ships is to be calculated according to the dates of the first and last dinner meals taken on board.

151. When Governors, Bishops,* or other Officers who may be entitled to conveyance at the expense of the Imperial Treasury, have to obtain passages in mail packets or private ships, it will be necessary that certified statements of the expenses and of the dates at which they were incurred should, without delay, be sent to the Colonial Office, supported by such vouchers as can be reasonably be procured. Evidence of the ordinary kind, as reference to a tariff (if any), or the certificate of two merchants, should, as a rule, be forwarded, that the rate of charge is usual or reasonable. The statements of other Officers than the Governor must bear his counter-signature of approval. The expenditure will be subject to review, and, if necessary, to disallowance, by the Secretary of State; and it will be desirable, though not indispensable, that his sanction should be obtained before Bills be drawn for the sums spent. Such Bills should be drawn on the Paymaster-General, at not less than ten days' sight and an immediate and direct advice should, in each case, be sent to the Secretary of State.

152. Any question that may arise in connection with passage allowances, &c., and may not have been provided for in the foregoing Regulations, will be separately considered and decided by the Secretary of State.

153. Whenever any person in this country shall be appointed to any Office, the salary and fees (if any) attached to which do not exceed £500† per annum, in a Colony not possessing a Representative Assembly,‡ the Crown Agents for the Colonies will secure and pay for his passage to the Colony, also those of his wife and children, not exceeding four persons besides himself. The person so appointed will be required to execute an "Agreement" in the form inserted in the Appendix (page 363). See Circular 20th April, 1871.

154. No outfit is allowed on any occasion.

* A special arrangement exists with regard to the Bishop of Newfoundland.
† In Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, Labuan, and British Honduras the limit is not £500, or its equivalent, but $3,000, and in Ceylon and Mauritius, Rs. 7,500.
‡ Medical Officers appointed to British Guiana are not allowed passage for their wives or families, and their own passage allowance must not exceed £30.
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

CHAPTER VI.

§ I. Precedency, Victoria Cross, Foreign Orders, Salutes, and Flags.

155. The precedence of Colonial Officers is in some cases determined by Colonial enactments by Royal Charters, by Instructions communicated either under the Royal Signet and Sign Manual through the Secretary of State, or by authoritative usage. In the absence of any such special authority, Governors are to guide themselves by the subjoined table.

*156. Table of precedence of Colonial Officers.

The Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or Officer administering the Government.
The Senior Officer in command of the Troops, if of the rank of a General, and the Officer in command of Her Majesty's Naval Forces on the Station, if of the rank of an Admiral, their own relative rank being determined by the Queen's Regulations on that subject.
The Bishop.
The Chief Justice.
†The Senior Officer in command of the Troops, if of the rank of Colonel or Lieutenant-Colonel, and the Officer in command of Her Majesty's Naval Forces on the Station, if of equivalent rank, their own relative rank being determined by the Queen's Regulations on that subject.
The Members of the Executive Council.
‡The Puisne Judges.
The President of the Legislative Council.
The Members of the Legislative Council.
The Speaker of the House of Assembly.
The Members of the House of Assembly.
The Colonial Secretary (not being in the Executive Council).
The Commissioners or Government Agents of Provinces or Districts.
The Attorney-General.
The Solicitor-General.
The Senior Officer in command of the Troops, if below the rank of Colonel or Lieutenant-Colonel, and the Senior Naval Officer of corresponding rank.
The Archdeacon.
The Treasurer, Paymaster-General, or Collector of Internal Revenue.
The Auditor-General or Inspector-General of Accounts.
The Commissioner of Crown Lands.
The Collector of Customs.
The Comptroller of Customs.
The Surveyor-General.
Clerk of the Executive Council.
Clerk of the Legislative Council.
Clerk of the House of Assembly.

157. In Courts for the trial of Piracy, the Members are to take rank according to the order in which they are designated in Her Majesty's Commission; except in the case of the Naval Commander-in-Chief (where there is one), to whom, as a matter of courtesy, the chair on the right of the President of the Court is assigned.

§158. Persons entitled to precedence in the United Kingdom or in Foreign Countries, or in other Colonies, are not entitled, as of a right, to the same precedence in a Colony; but in the absence of any special Instructions from the Queen, the precedence of such persons relatively to the above-mentioned Colonial Officers will be determined by the Governor, having regard to the social condition of the Colony under his Government.

159. The Queen's Warrants instituting "the Victoria Cross" and extending it to Local Forces in the Colonies, and the Queen's Regulations respecting Foreign Orders and Medals, are inserted in the Appendix (page 362). The Regulations relating to Salutes are contained in the Chapter of "The Queen's Regulations and the Admiralty Instructions for the Government of Her Majesty's Naval Service" which is supplied to every Governor. (See Circular 16th January, 1873, as to the relative position of Naval and Military Officers when taking part in ceremonies on shore. See Circular 30th August, 1873, as to the position to be assigned to a Naval Officer when sitting as a Member of a Court of Enquiry into the circumstances attending the loss of a merchant ship. See Circular of 24th October, 1873, as to precedence of ex-Members of Executive Council who have been allowed to retain the title of Honourable within the Colony.)

A Colonial Governor absent from his Colony on leave, or otherwise than on a Special Mission expressly authorised by Her Majesty's Government, is not entitled to any salute, or to fly any flag, as

* The table of precedence within the Dominion of Canada is given in Appendix 17, p. 370.

† When two or more Colonies are comprised within one Military or Naval Command, the Military or Naval Officers holding the command in any such Colony, in the absence of the superior Commanding Officers, will retain the precedence assigned to them by these Regulations, notwithstanding the presence of such superior Officers. No other Military and Naval Officers have any place at all in the General Table of Colonial Precedence, and the places accorded therein to the Senior Military Officer and the Senior Naval Officer have no connection, except as between those two Officers, with the Regulations governing Military and Naval Precedence, but when two or more Colonies are comprised within one Military or Naval Command, the Military or Naval Officers holding the command in any such Colony, in the absence of the superior Commanding Officers, will retain the precedence assigned to them by these Regulations, notwithstanding the presence of such superior Officers. Circulars of 3rd July, 1891, and 17th October, 1894.

‡ The position here assigned to the Puisne Judges has not been made applicable generally to Colonies possessing Responsible Government, in which, in the absence of any such special arrangements as are contemplated by the 154th Regiment, and as are, in fact, in operation in several of the Colonies, the Puisne Judges take precedence next after the Speaker of the House of Assembly.

§ By circular despatch of 26th February, 1889, it is directed that members of the Royal Family should take precedence next after the Governor of the Colony, and Governors of other Colonies should have precedence next after the military and naval officers commanding Her Majesty's forces and being of the rank of General or Admiral respectively.
these attributes are only allowable when he is actually representing the Sovereign. A Governor so absent should promptly decline all salutes or other official recognitions of a Royal character from any Foreign Ship or Troops; but he should avail himself of any offer made to him to be received on board, or to be conveyed by Her Majesty's ships or boats; though he cannot demand this attention. (Enclosed in Circular, 28th September, 1879.)

(1.) Whenever a requisition is received by any Officer in command of one of Her Majesty's ships, for the embarkation or conveyance of a Governor, High Commissioner, Lieutenant-Governor or Officer administering the Government of a Colony, the Senior Officer present may direct the special Flag of such official personage to be hoisted at the foretop-gallant masthead of the ship in which he is embarked; provided that he, after consultation with, and on requisition from that official, considers it for the benefit of the service about to be performed that such Flag should be hoisted, and provided that it is only hoisted or carried within the limits of his Government or High Commission in which he would be entitled to be saluted under Article 18, page 4, of the Queen's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, 1879.

(2.) If the Senior Officer considers it in any circumstances undesirable to hoist the Flag, he is to inform the Governor, High Commissioner, &c., of his reasons, and at once report the same to the Admiralty.

(3.) In the event of a Governor, High Commissioner, &c., of a Colony being detached on a Foreign Mission in his official capacity as Governor or High Commissioner, special instructions will be issued in each case as to the Flag which should be carried by a man-of-war in which he may be embarked; in the absence of which the Senior Officer present is to exercise his discretion in consultation with the official proceeding on the mission. (See Circular, 19 April, 1880.)

§ II. Colonial Uniforms.

160. The Uniform which was formerly worn by certain Colonial Civil Officers has been discontinued and the Uniform of Her Majesty's Civil Service in this country has been substituted for it. But Officers who have already worn the old Uniform may, if they prefer it, continue to wear it, subject to the limitation contained in paragraph 164.

161. The Civil Uniform of the First Class will be worn by the Governors of Canada, Jamaica, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, New Zealand, Western Australia, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Straits Settlements, Mauritius, Malta, the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, British Guiana, Trinidad, Barbados, and the Governors-in-Chief of the Windward and Leeward Islands; and the Uniform of the Second Class will be worn by Governors of Colonies not comprised in the foregoing list, and by Lieutenant-Governors.

162. The Uniform of the Third Class will be worn by Officers administering the Government of any Colony, but not holding the rank of Lieutenant-Governor, and may be worn by Members of the Colonial Ministry in Colonies having Responsible Government, and by Official Members of the Court of Policy in British Guiana, and of Executive Councils or Councils of Government in other Colonies.

163. Subject to the sanction of Her Majesty, obtained through the Secretary of State, the Uniform of the Fourth Class may be worn by Heads of Principal Departments not having a seat in the Executive Council, or Council of Government, or in the Legislature; and the Uniform of the Fifth Class may be worn by Heads of Subordinate Departments and Chief Assistants in the Principal Departments; but permission to wear the Uniform of the Fourth or Fifth Class shall not be given to the holder of any office in regard to which the Queen shall not have sanctioned the use of such Uniform. Private Secretaries to Governors or Officers administering the Government of all Colonies may wear the Uniform of the Fifth Class. (The following Circulars relate to Uniforms, viz., those of 15th February, 1859; 14th July, 1860; 16th July, 1864; 17th February, 1873; 5th August, 1873; 19th November, 1873; 22nd December, 1873.

164. No person is entitled without the consent of the Queen to wear the Uniform attached to any Office after he has ceased to hold that office. Such consent can only be obtained on the recommendation of the Governor, made through the Secretary of State, and only in cases of long or meritorious service. No retired Officer will be allowed to wear any other Uniform than that which was attached to his Office during his tenure of it and which he has actually worn.

164A. Governors may, with the special sanction of the Secretary of State, wear the uniform of Lord Lieutenant at Reviews, Inspections, &c., of Naval and Military Forces in the Colonies. The civil uniform should continue however to be worn on all other occasions.

CHAPTER VII.

CORRESPONDENCE.

§ I. Mode in which Governors and Officers administering Colonial Governments (with certain exceptions in the West Indies and West Africa) are to conduct their Official Correspondence.

165. Governors, or Officers administering Colonial Governments, must address the Secretary of State for the Colonial Department alone on all matters connected with their Government.

166. Every communication, therefore, to whatever Public Department in this Country it may more immediately relate, must in the first instance be addressed to the Secretary of State, with the exceptions hereafter mentioned; but in cases in which the Colonial Office is merely the channel of communicating with other Departments, the matter to be reported may be embodied in a memorandum addressed to the Department concerned, and forwarded to the Secretary of State in a covering despatch.

167. The Governor's Despatches should be written in a large and distinct hand, with dark ink, on folio paper of uniform size; and an inner margin of about one-third of the page should be left.

168. They are to be numbered in succession, commencing annually with a fresh series, without interruption from changes in Her Majesty's Government.

169. Each despatch should be confined as much as possible to a single subject. The paragraphs of each despatch should be numbered, and if it consists of two or more sheets the pages should be numbered.

170. When any Colonial or Imperial law, or any previous letters or despatches, are referred to, they must be described by their numbers and dates, either in the body of the despatch or in the margin.
171. Each despatch must be docketed. The docket should specify the date and place of which the despatch was written, the name of the writer, and of the Secretary of State to whom it is addressed, the subject of the despatch, and the number of its enclosures.

172. Its enclosures should be noted in the margin, and reference made, in the body of the despatch to such portions of them as may require particular attention.

173. The enclosures must be copied separately on folio paper, corresponding in size with the despatch transmitting them, and must also be written in a large and distinct hand, with dark ink; the paragraphs of each enclosure should be numbered. If an enclosure should be a copy of a despatch or letter, it should be preceded by a heading designating the person by whom, the person to whom, it is written, and the date. If it be a copy of a petition or memorial, a similar descriptive heading should be prefixed.

174. Should the enclosures be in any foreign language, translations of them, as well as copies, are to be forwarded.

175. The enclosures are also to be paged consecutively through the whole series; but each enclosure should be separately numbered, and docketed like the despatch, and the docket should specify that the document is an "Enclosure in ——— despatch, No. ——— of ———."

176. If any printed documents are transmitted as enclosures, six copies of each should be sent, if they are easily to be procured. In case of newspapers or other printed documents, of which only a portion may require attention, the portion referred to should be cut out, and pasted on foolscap paper, with a note at the head of the date and title of the paper from which it is extracted, the five extra copies required being annexed in an appendix.*

177. Despatches forwarded to the Secretary of State should be accompanied by a schedule,† and likewise with a statement of the numbers and dates of all despatches which the Governor may have received from the Secretary of State since the preceding occasion, in lieu of a separate acknowledgment of each despatch.

177a. With the view of facilitating the despatch of business, and of guarding against neglect or undue delay in the conduct of correspondence, the Governor of a Colony will send home by the first mail of every month:—

(1.) A schedule of despatches received from the Secretary of State which have been more than a month in his hands without an answer.

(2.) A schedule of despatches sent by the Governor to the Secretary of State which appear to have remained unanswered for more than one month after having been received.

It should be stated in each case whether any inconvenience is occurring, or likely to occur, by delay in answering. (Enclosure to Circular, 26 October, 1880.)

178. All addresses or petitions to the Queen, on parchment, must be accompanied by a transcript on official paper. Protests by Legislative or Executive Councillors should be unfailingly sent home, and if questions respecting legislative proceedings are referred to the Secretary of State, the reference must always be accompanied by extracts from those proceedings.

179. Every Legislative Act must be accompanied by a statement from the Law Officer of the Crown to the effect that, in his opinion, the Royal Assent may properly be given thereto, or ought not to be, and also by a report from the Governor, or from the Law Officer, giving all requisite explanation respecting the object of the Act, the motive in which it originated, and any legal or political question which it may involve. Such a report should be sent separately with any Act of unusual importance. Other Acts may be transmitted in batches as they receive the Governor's assent.

180. For the due preparation of Drafts of Acts, special rules are laid down in the Governor's Instructions.

181. Every Act must be enrolled in the Chief Court of Justice in the Colony. For the practice of engrossing and enrolling Acts in this country, see the Appendix (page 365).

182. In the month of January each year, or as soon after as may be practicable, a complete collection should be published, for general information, of all Acts or Ordinances enrolled during the preceding year, and six copies of such collection of Acts, &c., shall be sent home.

183. Whenever it may be found necessary to address the Secretary of State in a more unreserved manner than a Public Despatch would admit with propriety or convenience to the public interest, such communication should be marked "Confidential;" but care must be taken that the regular series of Despatches shall contain a full account of all important transactions in the Colony, so that when Parliament may call for information as to any of those transactions a clear and connected view of what has taken place may be afforded by the numbered Despatches, without adding those which are "Confidential," and which should not be referred to in the public despatches.

184. It will, however, rest with the Secretary of State, in every case to decide whether such "Confidential" Despatches are or are not to be considered and recorded as public documents.

185. No allowance on account of travelling expenses will be made to any Officer or other person bringing Despatches to this Department, unless the intelligence transmitted be of such a nature as to appear to the Governor to justify the sending it by a special messenger.

186. Every Governor is enjoined to cause the Secretary of State's Despatches, addressed to himself, as well as copies of his own, addressed to the Secretary of State, whether "Confidential" or not, to be deposited in the Government House, if this has been the usual place of deposit for them, or in some other safe Building belonging to the Government.

187. Governors are forbidden to withdraw any public document so deposited, on retiring from their Governments.

188. Despatches are classified and should be dealt with as follows:—

1. Numbered Despatches,‡ which the Governor is to lay before his responsible advisers (or the Executive Council), unless there be some special reason to the contrary, and which he may publish unless expressly directed not to do so.

2. Despatches marked Confidential, which the Governor may, if he thinks fit, communicate under the obligation of confidence to his Responsible Advisers (or to the Executive Council) and may

* S.Circular, 12th March, 1884
† By Circular of 1st October, 1894, the schedule is required to be sent in duplicate.
‡ By Circular, 7th Dec., 1892, formal correspondence, such as records of telegrams, &c., should not be numbered.
make public, if it should appear to him that circumstances are not such as to render it necessary that they should continue to be kept confidential.

3. Despatches marked Secret, which are addressed to the Governor personally, and the contents of which he is forbidden to make known without express authority from the Secretary of State.*

The foregoing instructions apply also to telegrams.

§ II. Mode in which the Officers administering subordinate Governments are to conduct their Official Correspondence.

189. The Colonies of Barbados,† St. Vincent, Grenada, Tobago, and St. Lucia, are consolidated into one General Government, called the Government of the Windward Islands; the Colonies of Antigua, Montserrat, St. Christopher, Nevis, the Virgin Islands, and Dominica, into a second, called the Government of the Leeward Islands; and the Settlements of Sierra Leone, Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos into a third, called the Government of the West Africa Settlements. The Officers administering the subordinate Governments are, in the West Indies, called Lieutenant-Governors or Presidents, in the West Africa Settlements, Administrators.

190. The correspondence of the Governors-in-Chief with the Secretary of State must be conducted in the mode which has been established by the preceding Regulations; but they will take care to keep the series of Despatches, relating to each Colony within their respective Commands, detached and separate from the rest.

191. During the absence of the Governor-in-Chief from any Island or Settlement comprised within his Command, the Officer administering the Government of that Island or Settlement should correspond with him on all subjects connected with this Office, and should transmit to him all Official Reports and information touching the same, and should apply to him for all such instructions as he may require for his guidance in the discharge of his duties.

192. If, during the absence of the Governor-in-Chief from any subordinate Government within the limits of his Command, exigencies should arise, in which it may be necessary that immediate instructions should be obtained from the Secretary of State, the Officer administering a subordinate Government is authorised to apply to the Secretary of State direct for instructions in relation thereto, if by so doing the Secretary of State can receive his Despatch at an earlier date than would be practicable through the intervention of the Governor-in-Chief.

193. Every such Officer will be required to transmit by the earliest opportunity to the Governor-in-Chief, or Officer administering the General Government, a copy of every Despatch or communication which he may, under this permission, address direct to the Secretary of State.

194. The Secretary of State will communicate his answer to any such Despatch, as may be most expedient, either to the Governor-in-Chief or direct to the Officer from whom he may have received it transmitting in the latter case a copy of the answer to the Governor-in-Chief.

195. Officers administering subordinate Governments will be guided, in their correspondence with the Governors-in-Chief, by the general Regulations which have been established by the Secretary of State in the preceding sections of this Chapter.

196. So long as the Governor-in-Chief is not present within the limits of his command, the above instructions must be understood to attach to the Acting Governor-in-Chief.

§ III. Military Correspondence.

197. The Governors of Colonies, commanding Her Majesty's Troops therein must separate their correspondence with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and the Secretary of State for War, in the following manner:—

198. Whatever relates to the discipline of the Troops, or to the employment of them in any ordinary and established Service, or to the relief of the Troops after their time of local Service shall have expired, or to the interior economy of Her Majesty's Land Forces, will properly form the subject of correspondence with the Secretary of State for War exclusively.

199. In the event of actual hostilities with any Foreign Enemy, or of any extraordinary employment of the troops for the maintenance of the public peace, such occurrences must be reported both to the Secretary of State for War and to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

200. In the event of its being thought necessary to make or to advise any Military Convention with the Officer in command of the Troops of any Foreign Power, a Governor commanding Her Majesty's Troops will at the same time report to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to the Secretary of State for War, the measures which he may have so taken, or those which he may wish to recommend for adoption.

201. In case it should be necessary, in order to render the Governor's Military Reports intelligible, to make reference, in his correspondence with the Secretary of State for War, to topics connected with his Civil Authority, he will in every such case at the same time bring under the notice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies the questions of Civil Government to which he may thus have had occasion to advert.

202. As any attempt to define the limits of a Governor's Civil and Military Correspondence may, from the nature of the case, be imperfect, and may omit to provide for some unforeseen exigency, he will best fulfil the joint pleasure of the Secretary of State for War and of the Secretary of State for the Colonies by conducting his Civil Correspondence exactly as he would conduct it if he possessed no Military Command, and vice versa. The two functions of Governor and of Commander of the Forces, though for the time combined in the same person, should be regarded in this respect as entirely separate, and the reports made by the Governor in each capacity should be made precisely in the same manner as if that combination of powers did not exist.

* See also Circular, 31st July, 1895.

† In 1884 Barbados was constituted a separate Government, and Tobago was united to Trinidad in 1888 (vide supra, Part II).

‡ The West Africa Settlements are now divided into four Governments, "Sierra Leone," "Gambia," the "Gold Coast Colony," and the "Colony of Lagos."—(Ed. C.O.L.)
203. The preceding instructions will apply also to the Governor's Correspondence respecting the Service of the Commissariat.

204. The respective officers employed under the War Office are in all cases without exception to give timely notice to Governors of any communications which they may intend to send home, affecting such Governors or the orders given by them, so that Her Majesty's Government may be simultaneously made acquainted with the opinions of the Governors and with the opinion of those Officers on any matter on which it is requisite that the views of both should be known.

205. When the Civil Governor of a Colony shall have occasion to report upon, or bring under the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, matters which involve military as well as civil considerations, or which require the decision or concurrence of the Secretary of State for War, the Governor will first communicate with the Officer in Command of the Forces in the Colony respecting the matters in question; and having obtained that officer's opinion or observations thereupon, he will transmit the same with his own report to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

206. The Officer in command of the Forces is similarly instructed, to obtain the opinion of the Governor before reporting to the Secretary of State for War, or to any Officer under whose general Command he is placed, on any matter which involves civil as well as military considerations, or which cannot be decided without reference to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

207. The Officer in command of the Forces has been instructed to send to the Governor duplicates of all Reports on whatever subjects, other than those relating to discipline and the routine of the service, which he may have occasion to send to the Secretary of State for War or to any Officer under whose general command he is placed. In case the Governor considers that these Reports require the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, he is to forward the duplicates with his observations by the same mail which conveys the original Report to the Secretary of State for War.

§ IV. Naval Correspondence.

208. Governors of Colonies should communicate with Officers of Her Majesty's Navy, and should convey notices of different kinds to Commanders of Foreign Vessels in Colonial waters, in the following mode.

209. The Governor will write in his own name to any Senior Naval Officer (that is to say, the Senior Officer then within his immediate reach), holding the rank of Flag Officer, Captain, or Commander, but will communicate with any Senior Officer of lower rank through his Private Secretary. In no case will he communicate through the Colonial Secretary, whose functions are of a different character, and whose Office should not be the place of deposit for communications between the Governor and Officers in Command of Her Majesty's Naval forces.

210. Any notice or direction, conveyed by the Governor's authority to the Commander of any Foreign Vessel, should be conveyed through the Officers of the Colonial Government, and not through the Officers of Her Majesty's Navy, whose intervention should not be applied for, unless the directions conveyed through the ordinary channel should fail to produce their effect.

§ V. Correspondence between the Postmaster-General in this Country, and the Postmasters, Packet Agents, &c., in the Colonies, upon matters affecting the Governor, or Orders given by his Authority.

215. Whenever any Postmaster, Packet Agent, or other Public Functionary acting under the immediate Orders and Instructions of Her Majesty's Postmaster-General, shall have occasion to transmit to the Postmaster-General any complaint or representation respecting the conduct of the Local Government of any of its Officers, he must simultaneously place in the hands of the Governor a copy of so much or any such report as it may be requisite for the Governor to answer, so that the complaint and the explanation may reach this Country at the same time.

216. Should the Governor have occasion to make to the Secretary of State any complaint or representation respecting the conduct of an Officer employed under Her Majesty's Postmaster-General, he will apprise such Officer of the precise nature of the complaint or representation which he proposes to forward, in order that the Officer to whom it relates may be enabled at once to transmit to the Postmaster-General any explanation which he may have to offer with respect to his conduct.

§ VI. Correspondence of Individuals.

217. Persons in a Colony, whether Public Functionaries or private individuals, who have any representations of a public or private nature to make to Government, should address them to the Governor of the Colony; or, if the Colony be a dependency of a Governor-in-Chief, then to the Officer in the immediate administration of its Government.

218. The duty of the Governor or Administrator of the Colony is to receive and act upon each such representation as public expediency or justice to the individual may appear to require, with the assistance in certain cases of his Executive Council; and if he doubts what steps to take thereupon, or if public advantage may appear to require it, to consult or report to the Secretary of State. Every individual has, however, the right to address the Secretary of State, if he thinks proper. But in this case he must transmit such communication, unsealed, and in triplicate, to the Governor or Administrator applying to him to forward it in due course to the Secretary of State.

219. Every letter, memorial, or other document which may be received by the Secretary of State from a Colony otherwise than through the Governor, will, unless a very pressing urgency justifies a departure from the rule, be referred back to the Governor for his report.

220. This rule, requiring transmission of correspondence with the Secretary of State through the Governor, is based on the strongest grounds of public convenience, in order that all communications may be duly verified, as well as reported on, before they reach the Secretary of State. It extends, therefore, to communications relating to public affairs as well as the concerns of the writer; to those of all Public Functionaries of whatever rank, and to those from public bodies.

221. Petitions addressed to the Queen, or the Queen in Council, memorials to Public Officers or Boards in Her Majesty's Government, &c., must be in like manner sent to the Governor for transmission home.

222. The Governor is bound to transmit to the Secretary of State every communication so received by him, accompanied by such report as its contents may appear to him to require.
223. He is to do this with all reasonable despatch, consistently, however, with the delay requisite for the preparation of such report.

224. The Public Officers and other inhabitants of the Windward and of the Leeward Islands and of the West Africa Settlements, will look upon the Governor-in-Chief of each of those Governments as the Referee on all occasions when they are dissatisfied with the judgment formed upon their cases by the Lieutenant-Governor of the particular Island or by the Administrator of the Settlement in which they may reside.

225. If they should wish to appeal from the judgment of the Governor-in-Chief to that of the Secretary of State, they are of course at liberty to do so, adhering strictly to the regulations which are above established.

226. In any reports to be made, either by Lieutenant-Governors or Administrators to the Governors-in-Chief, or by the Governors-in-Chief to the Secretary of State, of questions for decision, they will adopt the following rules:

227. The Report should comprise three distinct divisions: the first containing a simple narrative of the facts of the case, in the order in which they have occurred, as collected from the documents under consideration, showing merely the substance of the statements made, and of the rights asserted, or the complaints alleged by the respective parties concerned; the second containing the views of the writer as to the merits or demerits of the parties, or the justice of their several claims or complaints, with the reasons upon which those views proceed; and the third, the decision at which the writer has arrived, after a full investigation of the whole case.

228. In any Report or Despatch addressed to the Secretary of State, care should be taken to refer the Secretary of State to former documents in his possession which may bear on the case, with their dates. But this is not to prevent the writer from embodying the substance of such former documents in his Report or Despatch, if he judge that greater clearness or saving of labour is thereby attainable.

§ VII. Attestation of Documents.

229. The attestation of Signatures to Documents can only take place upon a full knowledge or intimate belief in the genuineness of those Signatures, and as a general rule, the Secretary of State can only undertake to attest those of Governors or Officers administering Government.

230. Persons, therefore, who may have occasion to instruct their friends or agents in any Colony to send them certificates, or powers of attorney, or judicial acts, for legal use in this Country, should take care to have those documents authenticated in the Colony by the Officer administering the Government.

231. The same rule must particularly be observed by the Governor in sending home documents which, after being verified in England, are intended to be used in foreign Countries. The last signature attached by way of attestation to any such document must invariably be one which is known and can therefore be certified to in this Department. If possible it should always be that of the Officer administering the Government.

248. The Returns mentioned in the last article should be made out in the forms inserted in the Appendix (page 366), but the Governor must not regard their transmission as relieving him from further explanations and responsibility.

249. The quarterly returns should be accompanied by a short abstract of the transactions of the Treasurer, or other Officer accountable to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, in the application of the Colonial Funds, showing the amount of his receipts and disbursements during the quarter, and the balances in hand, or available, at the commencement and end of it.

252. The Auditor will transmit through the Governor such Reports as he may from time to time have to send home, in order that the Governor may have an opportunity of adding any explanations which he may consider requisite in order to obviate the necessity of a further reference to the Colony.

253. All accounts of expenditure of public money must be accompanied by authenticated copies of, or extracts from, such of the Secretary of State's Despatches as may be referred to in the accounts, in support of particular items of expenditure.

254. Except so far as relates to money transactions between the Imperial and Colonial Governments the foregoing Regulations from 232 to 253 inclusive are only applicable to Crown Colonies.

255, 256. Cancelled by Circular Despatch of 13th September, 1887.

§ III. Other Periodical Returns.*

257. A Table of Duties payable on articles imported into, and exported from, the Colony should be punctually forwarded in duplicate so as to arrive in this country shortly before the 31st December of each year, with a view to enable the Board of Trade to prepare, at as early a period of the Session as possible, the Colonial Abstract and other papers annually laid before Parliament. In such table all additional rates levied on Imports and Exports under any special Acts or Regulations should be specified. (Enclosure to Circular of 25th January, 1881.)

258. Copies of the Minutes of the Proceedings of Legislative Councils and Assemblies, and in Colonies not possessing responsible Government, of Executive Councils.

259. Lists of Members of Executive and Legislative Councils, specifying the date of their appointment, and whether they hold any other Office in the Colony.

260. A return of changes which may occur from time to time under the provisions of the Vice-Admiralty Courts Act of 1863, in the persons holding the office of Judge Marshal or Registrar for communication to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.†

261. In Colonies in which it is customary to print the Laws the Governor will send home not fewer than eighteen, or in case of Acts affecting the Constitution, or containing a suspending clause, or reserved for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure, twenty-one copies of all Acts passed during the Session of the Colonial Legislature, and six manuscript copies where the laws are not printed; and Her Majesty's Government will send out annually to the respective Governors, for the use of the Colonial Legislatures and Courts of Justice, copies of the British Statutes. Of the printed copies of Acts twelve are to be sent under flying covers, addressed as below. Those intended for the Colonial Office, House of Lords and House of Commons, should be sent home as soon as printed. The copies for the other public departments and societies should be sent once a-year to the Crown Agents for the Colonies, for distribution.

1. House of Lords.
2. House of Commons.
3. To the Board of Trade.
4. To the British Museum.

263. Two copies of the Colonial Book Almanack for the current year, and copies of Government Gazettes, and generally of such books or pamphlets issuing from the Colonial Press as may be useful to this Department, and of the principal newspapers published in the Colony. (Special instructions as to the newspapers to be sent home issued in Circulars, 31st October, 1870, and 10th June, 1871.)

264, 265, 266. Cancelled by Circular Despatch of 13th September, 1887.

267. In Colonies possessing considerable quantities of waste land in course of settlement, the Surveyor-General should be required once a year to present a return of the progress of his department, for transmission to the Secretary of State. Besides making these regular returns, Governors are particularly enjoined to keep the Secretary of State punctually informed of the progress of geographical and scientific exploration in the Colonies, and in particular to transmit reports of journeys of discovery and investigations of the natural history and capabilities of particular districts, with such maps and surveys as may be required for elucidation.

§ IV. The Annual "Blue Book."

268. In addition to the particular Returns mentioned in the preceding Section, the annual "Blue Book," containing specific accounts of the Civil Establishments, of the Colonial Revenue and Expen-

* See also Circulars, 17th September, 1885, 5th March, 1870, and 27th July, 1895.

† This return is no longer required. See Circular, 9th May, 1893.
diture, and of various statistical particulars, &c., must be completed as early as possible after the close of each year. The various Returns which it comprises must be filled up with the greatest possible accuracy; and the statistical tables must be full and complete. Blank copies of this book, in sheets, will be annually transmitted to each Colony from the Colonial Office.

269. The Colonial Secretary will be responsible for the general preparation of the "Blue Book," and for its being completed during the first quarter of the year succeeding that for which it is designed, and he must certify the accuracy of its contents.

270. The Governor must send home the "Blue Book" in duplicate. He is to retain one copy for the use of the Executive Government, and in the Legislative Colonies to lay a copy of it before the Council and the House of Assembly respectively.

271. The Governor, in transmitting the "Blue Book" to this Department, must accompany it with a Report, which should be written on one side of the paper only, exhibiting generally the past and present state of the Colony, and its prospects under the several heads specified in the Book. That Report will be laid before both Houses of Parliament.

It should be, as much as may be, complete within itself, and if it be unavoidable to append other Returns than those to be found in the Blue Book reported upon, they should be of a summary character, and clear of such local details as are of no use and significance elsewhere than on the spot; bearing in mind that the extent to which what is printed for Parliament shall be circulated and read, will depend much on the degree to which it is substantive and succinct.

CHAPTER IX.

§ I. Requisitions from Colonies.

272. Requisitions from the Colonies for stores may be made direct to the Crown Agents, by the proper Colonial Officer, if the expenditure has been duly sanctioned by law or ordinance, or by previous instructions from the Secretary of State. Every requisition should bear a reference to the authority for the expenditure.

273. In the event of there being no such authority as above mentioned, the requisition must be transmitted to the Secretary of State in the first instance, in duplicate, and not to the Crown Agents.

274. In the latter case it is necessary that the requisitions should be accompanied with all the explanations necessary for the guidance of Her Majesty's Government in determining whether they should or should not be complied with.

275. Requisitions should in no case be made directly, or through local merchants, upon firms in this country, although the names of the firms whose goods have given most satisfaction may be mentioned in the body of the requisition, in order that if the Secretary of State should so decide, they may be asked to tender, through the Crown Agents, for a further supply of the same articles.

276. The list containing the specific articles required must be attested by the Governor.

277. No requisition must be made to replace articles spoilt or worn out until a Board of Survey, consisting of not less than three Public Officers, of whom the Colonial Secretary should in general be President, has been held upon the articles. A certificate of the Board, stating that the articles in question are unserviceable and require to be replaced, must accompany the requisition.

278. The Officer at the head of the Department must be debited with the unserviceable articles, or the Board of Survey must give directions for having them sold by public auction, whenever the quantity accumulated shall render such sale expedient.

279. Every Board of Survey must furnish the Governor with a Report of their proceedings.

280. They are also required to consider and report to the Governor the propriety of every requisition for articles to be supplied for the public service, taking care that no article is demanded which is not absolutely necessary.

281. Governors are expected to revise the requisitions and the Reports of the Boards, and to direct the Boards to reconsider their reports should it be necessary; and to forward them to the Secretary of State with their own observations.

282. In any case in which a Colony, not habitually employing the Crown Agents, makes a remittance to them of funds (in whatever manner or for whatever purpose), the Governor is to forward to the Secretary of State by the same mail the particulars of such remittance.

§ II. Government Houses, Furniture, &c.

283. The Governor will insert in the annual "Blue Book" a general Report on the state of repair, &c., of the Government House or Houses, the state of the furniture, and the arrangements under which it is provided.

284. The Government House, together with its stables, out-buildings, fences, and other appurtenances, will be kept in substantial repair throughout, at the cost of the Colony. The rooms will be painted, and papered (when necessary), and furnished at the public expense. Plate and table ornaments to a moderate and reasonable amount, and crockery, glass, cutlery, and kitchen utensils will also be provided at the cost of the Colony. Unless it is otherwise provided by local law the Governor will pay 5 per cent. per annum on the estimated value of the furniture in the bed-rooms, kitchens, and other rooms not used for the public reception of company, and of all other articles provided at the cost of the Colony, and used by him, but he will be subject to no charge on account of the furniture of the reception rooms or of the offices used by himself or by his Private Secretary or Aide-de-Camp. For the purpose of arriving at the estimated value of the furniture, and other articles on which the Governor is to pay a percentage, a valuation will be made by such persons as may be appointed for that purpose by the
Executive Council on the Governor's assumption of the Government and annually thereafter during the Governor's tenure of office.

284a. Arrangements have been entered into between the Crown Agents and Contractors to keep always in stock a selected pattern of crockery and glass for a best and second best service for dinner and dessert as well as for breakfast, tea, and coffee sets, with a badge consisting of a Royal Crown, the letters V.R. in a monogram, and the name of the Colony and the words "Government House" on a scroll beneath.

285. All the Chapel plate and furniture, and pictures of the Royal Family, which may have been formerly supplied to Governors' houses, are to be considered public property, and not to be removed on any account.

286. All furniture and plate supplied at the public expense is to be kept complete; and any article lost or damaged, otherwise than by fair wear, is to be made good at the expense of the Officer occupying the Government House for the time being.

287. It is the duty of every Governor to keep an accurate inventory of all furniture and plate provided at the public expense; of which inventory he must cause one copy to be retained in the Government House, and one to be delivered to some one Officer of his Government, who, on satisfying himself that the inventory so delivered to him is correct, will be held responsible for its safe custody.

288. The Governor must from time to time, and not seldom than once in every two years, require and direct the Officer, whom he may appoint as above, to make an inspection of the furniture, and plate, comparing the several articles with the inventory in his possession; and that Officer is to prepare a list of all deficiencies, which the Governor must thereupon take measures to have replaced or rectified at his own expense.

289. Within one month from the date of an inspection, such Officer shall deliver to the Governor a report thereof, in which shall be noted the deficiencies, if any.

290. On each occasion of a Colonial Governor vacating his Government, a similar inspection and report are to be made; and if the retiring Officer does not cause the deficiencies for which he is responsible to be repaired or made good, the inspecting Officer (in communication with the Officer who may succeed to the Government) is to prepare and transmit to the Secretary of State a statement of the expense to be incurred for that purpose, in order to the recovery of the amount from the responsible Officer.

291. The Government Offices in the respective Colonies may also be supplied, at the public expense, with such furniture, of a plain but substantial kind, as may be absolutely requisite for the proper accommodation of the persons belonging to the Departments, while engaged in the transaction of the public business.

292. The same regulations are to be observed in regard to the custody and repair of furniture supplied to Government Offices at the public expense as have been established in the case of Governors' residences. (As to making good defective crockery and supply of same pattern through the Crown Agents, see Circulars, 26th August, 1880, and 8th January, 1873.)

CHAPTER X.

§ I. Custody of Public Moneys in Colonies not possessing Representative Assemblies.

293. The Governor may, with the concurrence of the Council, and the approval of the Secretary of State, avail himself of the services of any Banking Establishments in the Colony for the deposit of all, or any portion of the public moneys arising from Colonial revenue or other Colonial receipts, as well as for the transaction of public business connected with the financial arrangements of the Colony. It is to be understood that any moneys placed in the Banks are liable to fluctuation in amount, or to be withdrawn, according to the exigencies of the public service, but the Governor will not be precluded from making a special arrangement for the transfer of a portion of the balance from the current account of the Colonial Government to a deposit account.

294. When no Banking Establishments exist, or where it is not thought advisable to employ them, or when they may be had recourse to for the deposit of part only of the public money, the Governor will cause a secure fire-proof vault or safe to be constructed, either for the office of the Treasurer or in some other appropriate Building, for the deposit of all surplus moneys. This building is to be duly watched and guarded, and the door of the vault or safe to be furnished with three different locks, the keys of which are to be kept by, and under the separate charge—one, of the Treasurer, and the others of such two principal Officers of the Government as the Governor may consider it most expedient to appoint for such purpose.

295. The Colonial Treasurer, or Receiver-General, is to keep under his own immediate charge, such sums of money only as may be necessary to meet the current disbursements of his Department, not exceeding a certain fixed maximum. If Banking Establishments be employed for the deposit only of surplus moneys, or if a strong vault be used for that purpose, the Treasurer's separate balance will, in either case, be regulated by the average amount of his monthly ordinary expenditure; but if recourse shall be had to the Banking Establishments for the transaction of current business, as well as for the deposit of surplus moneys, the balance to be left in the hands of the Treasurer will be of small amount, to meet only minor incidental expenses.

296. When it is necessary to fix or alter the amount of the maximum balance which may remain in the hands of the Treasurer, the Governor will, after the necessary inquiries, report to the Secretary of State, for the consideration of the Lords of the Treasury, the sum which he may decide upon for such maximum balance, accompanying this report by statements of the Treasurer's average monthly ordinary receipts and disbursements (distinguishing fixed revenue from incidental receipts, and pay and salaries from contingent disbursements), and by such other explanations and observations as may have been submitted to him, and upon which he may have grounded his decision.

297. In order that the Governor may at all times have the means of informing himself as to the state and disposal of the public balance, and of providing effectually for its verification, he will cause the Regulations which he has received from the Lords of the Treasury in this respect to be strictly observed by all concerned.
298. If the Governor shall have availed himself of the services of a Banking Establishment in the Colony, he will require from the Secretary, or other proper Officer of such Establishment, a monthly statement of all sums deposited in and withdrawn from the Bank, and of the balance of public money remaining in the Bank at the end of each month.

299. The Governor will take care that arrangements are made with the Directors or Managers of these Establishments, so that the Colonial Treasurer Receiver-General, or other Accountant, shall not have sole control over the sums deposited therein.

300. To effect this object the cheques on the Bank for the payment of ordinary disbursements should invariably be countersigned by the Officer next in rank at the Treasurer's or Accountant's office.

301. In those cases where the Banks may have had recourse to only for the deposit of surplus moneys, the cheques should be countersigned by the Governor, as his warrant of authority to the Bank for the re-issue of the money.

302. When the Banks are used for deposits, and also for the transaction of the current business of the Government, it is necessary that the Governor should fix the maximum sum for which the Treasurer's draft, countersigned by his principal Assistant, may be honoured, and beyond which sum the Governor's warrant of authority, as above described, is to be required in addition.

303. If the surplus funds, or any portion thereof, shall be deposited in a strong vault, the Governor is to require from the three Officers in charge a quarterly return of the moneys deposited therein.

304. The strong vault is on no occasion to be opened, nor is any money to be deposited therein or withdrawn therefrom, except by the three persons entrusted with the keeping of the separate keys, and by an order or warrant under the Governor's signature (such orders or warrants to be for round sums) addressed to the Treasurer or Accountant, and to the two other Officers concerned; and the three Officers entrusted with the keys, and present at the opening of the vault, are to sign a joint certificate as to every sum deposited, which certificate is to be delivered to the Treasurer, to be annexed with other vouchers to his accounts.

305. The Treasurer is, in like manner, to sign receipts in duplicate for every amount re-issued to him, which receipts are to be delivered to the other Officers in charge of the vault.

306. In case of illness, absence, or other unavoidable circumstance interfering with the strictly personal duty prescribed by these regulations, the written authority of the Governor is to be obtained for any temporary transfer of the key to another Officer.

307. The Governor will cause to be prepared on the 1st days of January, April, July, and October of each year, a statement of the sums of the funds of the Colonial chest, in the form prescribed for that purpose by the Lords of the Treasury. (See also Circular, 7th May, 1878.)

308. The Governor will also cause an examination of the funds of Colonial chests to be made twice in each year, or as much oftener as he may think fit to direct, at uncertain periods, and without any previous notice, and he will immediately forward to the Secretary of State the certificates of quarterly surveys as well as those made at uncertain periods; duplicate copies of these certificates are also to be annexed to the Colonial Treasurer's accounts. (See also Circular, 7th May, 1878.)

309. The Governor must bear in mind that arrangements relating to the deposit of Colonial Funds with any Banking Establishment should have for their object the convenience and accommodation of the Public Service only, and are not to be entered into with any particular view of enabling the Banks to increase their accommodations and loans to others, and the Governor will also take care that every proper advantage and allowance by way of interest for deposits that might be profitably employed by the Banks, is duly secured for the use and benefit of the Colonial Treasury and Government.

II.—Securities.—Security to be required from Persons appointed to the temporary charge of Offices of pecuniary trust in the Colonies not possessing Representative Assemblies.*

310. Officers entrusted with public money should give security in proportion to the average sum which may be passing through their hands at any time. If the Colonial Treasurer, or any other established Officer who has been called upon to give security to the Crown in respect of pecuniary responsibility attaching to his Office, shall obtain leave of absence under circumstances which require the interposition of the authority of the Governor for the appointment of a Substitute, the Governor will call upon the person whom he may select to act in the absence of the principal to give security, in his personal bond, to the Crown, with the bonds of two or more Sureties, to such an amount, with reference to the security of the principal, as may be reasonably required; or to furnish, in lieu of the Bond of Sureties, such other collateral security, upon property or otherwise, as shall be of equal amount and validity with such bonds.

311. In case the Governor should find that the person whom he may propose to appoint to the temporary charge of an Office of pecuniary trust cannot furnish the amount of collateral security required from him, the Governor will consider whether, in order to render so large an amount of collateral security unnecessary, some arrangement can be made for reducing the risk of loss, either by placing the Office in Commission, or by limiting the floating balance under the charge of the Officer to the smallest amount necessary to meet the current expenditure for ordinary contingent services, and by depositing all surplus beyond such reduced average balance in a separate Chest, under the joint charge of two or more Officers holding separate keys.

312. A full report of all the circumstances relating to any such special arrangement must be made to the Secretary of State for the information of the Lords of the Treasury, and in the event of the employment of a Commission the personal bonds of the Officers joined in Commission are to be taken as to their separate acts.

313. As all security required from persons appointed to the temporary charge of Offices vacated in consequence of leave of absence, or from any other cause, is to be independent of, and unconnected with, any security which may have been given by the established Officer, the Governor is particularly cautioned that the bonds or other instrument which may be prepared with a view of giving effect to

* See Circular of 6th February, 1872, naming guarantee offices whose bonds may be accepted, and also Circulars of 25th March, 1884, and 1st August, 1885.
the security required from the acting Officers should have no reference to the bonds of the established Officer or of his Sureties, and should not contain any clause which might be construed as interfering with or affecting in any manner the original bonds of the principal, either during his absence or on his return to duty. At the same time it is not intended that this precautionary instruction should prevent the Governor from accepting the additional security of the principal who may be about to absent himself on leave, should he be willing to enter into a new bond for his Substitute, or to join in the security to be given by such Substitute.

§ III. Regulations respecting the Incorporation of Banking Companies in the Colonies.

314. In Charters or legislative Enactments relating to the Incorporation of Banking Companies in the Colonies, provision should be made for the observance of the following regulations and conditions.

315. The Amount of the Capital of the Company and Number of Shares to be determined; and the whole of such determined amount to be subscribed for within a limited period, not exceeding Eighteen Months from the date of the Charter or Act of Incorporation.

316. Shareholders to be declared a Body Corporate, with common seal and perpetual succession, and other usual corporate powers; and with any requisite proviso that judgment against the Corporation shall attach to all additional liability of the Shareholders, as well as to paid-up Capital and other property of the Company.

317. Provision to be made, either by Recital and Confirmation of any Deed of Settlement in these respects or otherwise, for the due Management of the Company's Affairs by Appointment of Directors, and so forth, so far as shall seem necessary for the security of the Public.

318. No bye-law of the Company to be repugnant to the conditions of the Charter or Act of Incorporation, or to the Laws of any Colony in which the Company's Establishments may be placed.

319. The Corporate Body thus constituted may be specially empowered, subject to the conditions hereafter mentioned, to carry on for a limited term of years (not to exceed Twenty-one Years unless under particular circumstances) and within the Colony or Colonies specified in the Charter or Act of Incorporation, but not elsewhere, the Business of Banker; and for the like term to issue and circulate within the said Colony or Colonies, but in such manner only as shall not be at variance with any general Law of the Colony, Promissory Notes payable in Specie on Demand.

320. Such Banking Business or Issue of Notes not to commence or take place until the whole of the Fixed Capital of the Company has been subscribed for, and a moiety at least of the Subscription paid up. The remaining moiety of the Capital to be paid up within a given period from the date of the Charter or Act of Incorporation, such period not in general to exceed two years.

321. In all cases in which Shares in the Company's Stock are transferred between the period of the Grant of the Charter or Act of Incorporation and the actual commencing of business by the Bank, the responsibility of the original holder of the transferred Shares to continue for Six Months at least after the date of the transfer.

322. The Company not to advance Money on Security of Lands, or Houses, or Ships, or on pledge of Merchandize, nor to hold Land or Houses, except for the transaction of its business, nor own Ships, or be engaged in Trade, except as Dealers in Bullion or Bills of Exchange; but to confine its transactions to discounting Commercial Paper and negotiable Securities, and other legitimate Banking Business: the Company may, however, accept Lands, or Houses, or Ships, or Shares in its Capital or Stock, or other Real or Personal Property in liquidation of, or as a Security for any Debt bond previously due to the Company, or as a security for payment of any Sum for which any person may have rendered himself liable to the Company, and hold them for such reasonable time as may be necessary to dispose of and convert the same into Money.

323. The Company not to hold Shares in its own Stock, nor to make advances on the security of those shares.

324. The Discounts or Advances by the Company, on securities bearing the name of any Director or Officer thereof, as drawer, acceptor, or endorser, not to exceed at any time one-third of the total Advances and Discounts of the Bank.

325. The dividends to Shareholders to be made out of Profits only, and not out of the subscribed Capital of the Company.

326. The total amount of the Debts and Liabilities of the Company, whether upon Bonds, Bills, Promissory Notes, or otherwise contracted, over and above the amount of Deposits on Banking Accounts with the Company's Establishments, not to exceed at any time three times the amount of the capital stock subscribed and actually paid up.

327. No Promissory or other Notes to be issued for Sums under £1. sterling (or in the North American Colonies £1. Halifax currency), or the equivalent thereof in any other local currency, and not for fractional portions of such Pound or other equivalent amount.

328. All Promissory Notes of the Company, whether issued from the Principal Establishment or from Branch Banks, to bear date at the place of issue, and to be payable on demand in Specie at the place of date.

329. The total amount of the Promissory Notes payable on demand, issued, and in circulation, not at any time to exceed the amount of the Capital Stock of the Company actually paid up. A reserve of specie always to be maintained equal to one-third of the amount of Notes at any time in circulation.

330. In the event of the assets of the Company being insufficient to meet its engagements, the Shareholders to be responsible to the extent of twice the amount of their subscribed Shares (that is, for the amount subscribed, and for a further and additional amount equal thereto).

331. Suspension of Specie Payments on Demand at any of the Company's Banking Establishments, for a given number of days (not in any case exceeding sixty) within any one year, either consecutively or at intervals, or other breach of the Special Conditions upon which the Company is empowered to open Banking Establishments or to issue and circulate Promissory Notes, to forfeit those privileges, which shall cease and determine upon such forfeiture as if the period for which they had been granted had expired.

332. The Company to make up and publish periodical Statements of its Assets and Liabilities monthly; showing under the heads specified in the form which is inserted in the Appendix, p. 367, the
average of the amount of its Notes in circulation, and other Liabilities, at the termination of each week or month, during the period to which the Statement refers, and the average amount of Specie or other Assets that were available to meet the same. Copies of these Statements to be submitted to the Government of the Colony within which the Company may be established; and the Company to be prepared, if called upon, to verify such Statements by the production, as confidential documents, of the Weekly or Monthly Balance Sheets from which the same are compiled. And also to be prepared, upon requisition from the Lords of the Treasury, to furnish, in like manner, such further information respecting the state or proceedings of its Banking Establishments as their Lordships may see fit to call for. The Governor to be also empowered to verify the Statements of the Company of the amount of Specie held by them.

333. The Charter or Act of Incorporation may provide for an addition to the Capital of the Company within specified limits, with the sanction of the Lords of the Treasury; such additional Capital and the Shares and Subscriptions which may constitute the same, to be subject in every respect, from and after the date of the signification of such sanction, to conditions and regulations similar to those applying to the original Capital.

§ IV. Applications for Charters.

334. Applications for Charters of Incorporation of Joint Stock Companies engaged exclusively or chiefly in Colonial undertakings, whether made in this Country or in the Colonies, cannot be granted until the heads of the project shall have been submitted for the consideration of the Governor and his Executive Council.

335. The Governor will furnish the Secretary of State with a Report stating whether the undertaking is one which in his opinion it would be desirable to encourage, with a view to Colonial interests, especially as regards the Colony under his Government.

336. The Governor's Report will be taken into consideration by the Secretary of State and by the Board of Trade, or, in cases in which the application relates exclusively to Banking Companies, by the Board of Treasury.

337. Her Majesty's Government reserves to itself the power of deciding whether privileges, to be exercised under Charters granted for this Country, should be extended to Companies, approved by the Colonial Government, for Colonial undertakings.

338. The Imperial Act 18 & 19 Vict., c. 133, provides for the limitation of liability of Members of certain Joint Stock Companies.

See also Circular of 16th March, 1874, as to establishment of Agencies, and Circular of 18th August, 1875, by which it is directed that Laws relating to Banking undertakings and the circulation of Notes should contain a suspending clause.

CHAPTER XI.

§ I. Expenditure of Public Money in Colonies not possessing Representative Assemblies.

339. All disbursements of the public money are to be made by the Colonial Treasurer, under authority from the Officer administering the Government; and any Officer improperly authorizing or directing any expenditure contrary to the instructions which he may receive from Her Majesty's Government will himself be held personally responsible for the amount improperly authorized.

340. Salaries, Fixed Allowances, and Contingencies are to be classed under the head "Establishments;" and all other ordinary expenditure, and all extraordinary and special disbursements are to be classed under separate heads of Service in the Form prescribed in the Treasury Instructions issued to Governors.

340a. All Salaries and other authorized Charges up to the end of each financial year should, as far as possible, be defrayed within the year. When the last day of a year happens to be a "dies non," the payment of Salaries, &c., up to the close of the year could be made on the previous day.

341. The Governor is not authorized to make any addition to the Fixed Establishment of the Colony, or to make any different appropriation of the established salaries of any Public Department, either as regards the number of appointments or the rates of salary and emolument, without the previous sanction of Her Majesty's Government.

342. Should, however, any special circumstances occur which in the opinion of the Governor in Council may render addition or alteration necessary for the due carrying on of the public service, without waiting for such sanction he will cause such new or altered salary to be borne on a Schedule of Provisional or Supplementary Establishment, reporting the same to the Secretary of State.

343. Whenever the approval of Her Majesty's Government to any provisional appointment is received by the Governor, he must cause the same to be transferred to the Schedule of Fixed Establishment.

344. As a general rule, the Governor must not propose to the Council the execution of any new public work, or of extensive alterations and improvements in any existing building, &c., for which he has not obtained the previous sanction of Her Majesty's Government.

345. Whenever the Governor may apply to the Secretary of State for such authority, he must send with such application all the necessary plans, estimates, and specifications, according to which the projected work is to be carried into execution, together with an account of the cost to be incurred under specific heads of expenditure, and a report of the grounds on which the work is recommended.

346. When the sanction of Her Majesty's Government has been given, the Governor will lay before the Council, at their meeting, to take into consideration the General Estimates for the year next ensuing, the plans, estimates, and specifications of the proposed work, with any other information which he may consider necessary; and when the Council has voted the funds required for the work the Governor may proceed with it, without waiting for further authority.

347. But should the Governor be of opinion that the work is urgently required, and that serious inconvenience might result from delaying it (after the sanction of Her Majesty's Government had been
obtained) until the period when the Annual Estimates are brought forward, he may propose to the Council a Supplemental Estimate for that purpose.

348. Special cases may arise of pressing emergency (more particularly in distant Colonies), in which it might not be practicable to obtain the previous sanction of Her Majesty's Government for a proposed work. In such cases the Governor will not fail to call for and to lay before the Council the necessary plans, estimates, and specifications according to which the work is to be carried into execution, and to report fully to Her Majesty's Government, by the earliest opportunity, on the absolute necessity of the expenditure which he may have incurred without their previous sanction.

349. In the case of public works of magnitude to be undertaken in any Colony, and to be defrayed by Parliamentary Grant, the following rules must be observed:

1. That as a preliminary step to any such work, a survey and estimate shall be made by an Officer acting under the orders of some responsible Department.

2. That on a first application for a vote of money, an estimate of the sum likely to be required for the whole work shall be laid before the House of Commons.

3. In cases in which such works may require more than one year for their completion, and where money is proposed to be voted on account, there shall be submitted to the House in each year, and before a further vote is proposed, a statement of the sums already voted, of the money actually expended up to the date of the last accounts, of all outstanding demands, and of the sum still wanting to complete the work; and any deviations from the original plan, or any contemplated addition to the magnitude or expense of the whole work, will be inserted in the estimate of the year.

4. No Department of the Government shall authorize any Officer to enter into contract for any work, beyond the limits of the annual grants of money, without the sanction of a Minute of the Lords of the Treasury, which will be laid before the House with as little delay as possible.

§ II. Colonial Estimates

350. In the Colonies not possessing Representative Assemblies, the Governor should submit to the Council of his Government, before the expiration of the month of June, in each year, such an Estimate as he may think necessary of the whole expenditure, not already fixed under the sanction of Her Majesty's Government, which is intended to be charged upon the Colonial revenue for the year then next ensuing, and he should transmit to the Secretary of State by the earliest opportunity, the Ordinance providing for the service of that year.

351. When the annual Estimate shall have been passed by the Council, and the Ordinance confirmed by Her Majesty, the expenditure of the year must be held to be definitely limited and arranged. Should, however, any further disbursements on account of the service of that year be required which could not have been foreseen, the proper course will be for the Governor to submit to the Legislative Council a Supplementary Estimate of the expenditure so required.

352. The Governor should transmit with the Annual Estimates such full and sufficient information as to every expense of an unusual nature therein comprised as may be necessary to enable Her Majesty's Government to decide upon the propriety of the proposed expenditure, together with a table exhibiting the variations from the preceding year.

353. The Governor should, at the same time that he proposes to the Council the Estimate of the ensuing year's expenditure, submit to them the draft of any Ordinance which may be necessary to provide the ways and means by which the expenditure is to be met.

354. Superseded by Circular of 20th January, 1875.

355. The control of the Local Auditor over all Revenue and Receipts, extends to a comparison of Receipts with all Collectors' Books, and with Statements, Returns, and other documents which may serve to establish that the sums received are those which ought to have been received; and, if not, to requiring a statement of the cause of each deficiency, and the measures taken for the recovery of any arrears.

356. The Local Auditor's examination should, therefore, include a reference to Tax Rolls and other records of Assessments, to periodical returns of licences, certified by the Colonial Secretary or other Officer empowered to direct the issue of the same; to similar Returns from the Magistrates, or other Law Officers, of all fines, forfeitures, &c.; to Lists, giving the names of any persons liable to be called upon for Tuition Fees, or other periodical payments to the Colonial Government; and, as to casual receipts, under the direction of the Governor, to half-yearly returns of Receivable Orders, issued by his authority in respect thereof.

357. Should any Return, Statement, or other Record, which may appear to the auditor necessary to substantiate the entries in the Receiver's Accounts, or to exhibit the amount of arrears, be wanting or defective, it will be the duty of the Auditor to call for the proper documents, or, if necessary, to make a representation on the subject to the Governor; and, should any difficulty arise as to the production of the same, a copy of such representation, and of any directions which may be given thereon, should be transmitted, with the Accounts sent home by the Auditor.

358. Detailed statements of the revenue and expenditure of the Colony should be annually published in the Colonial Gazette, immediately after the period when it is required that the Accounts of each year should be transmitted for audit; and in such publication, the funds, arising from the property or droits of the Crown, are to be stated separately from those which arise from taxes levied upon the inhabitants of the Colony.

§ III. Treasury Bills.—Funds derived from Imperial Grants in Aid of Local Revenues.

359. It is to be observed that sums voted by Parliament in respect of any financial year are not intended to defray the charges which become due in that year, but to meet such charges only as shall actually come in course of payment within the year. It is desirable, however, that the charges becoming due in each year should, as far as practicable, be defrayed from the Votes for the same year. With this view it will be proper that all Salaries and other authorized charges up to the end of any financial year should be paid before the close of the year, unless there be some special reason to the contrary.
360. Bills for Salaries and Allowances must not be drawn for broken periods of Quarters, except in cases where the services of the Officer have commenced or ceased within the Quarter; and in such cases Certificates should be transmitted, showing the date from which and up to which the Salary or Allowance may be payable.

360a. Governors will not be at liberty, without special authority, to draw funds before the commencement of a financial year, on the credit of any proposed Parliamentary Vote for that year.

360b. All Bills on the credit of the Parliamentary Grants in aid should be drawn on the Paymaster-General. When the service is of an ordinary description, they should be drawn at ten days' sight; but in every case of an unusual character, they should be at thirty days' sight. They should bear a serial number for each financial year. Salary Bills should be in the form prescribed in Appendix 13 (p. 367), with the addition of this serial number. All other Bills should distinctly specify the service and the particular Parliamentary Grant in respect of which they are drawn; and whenever the service is of an unusual character the Bills should also show the date and description of the document conveying the authority for the expenditure.

360. In cases where Salaries, Allowances, or Pensions, chargeable to Imperial Funds, are paid by monthly payments of one-twelfth of the annual rates, such payments are to be treated as final settlements—i.e., payments in full—for the periods to which they relate; and in these cases the computation for a broken period of a month is to be made with reference to the number of days in such month;

Thus:—If a salary of £120 per annum is paid by equal monthly payments, falling due at the close of each calendar month, the monthly amount will be £10; and if payment has to be made for a broken period, say, to 15th January inclusive, the amount to be paid will be \( \frac{1}{12} \) of £10.

In cases where Salaries, Allowances, or Pensions are paid by quarterly payments of one-fourth of the annual rates, the computation for a broken period of a quarter is to be made with reference to the number of days in that quarter;

Thus:—If a salary of £120 per annum is paid by quarterly payments, falling due at the close of each calendar quarter, the quarterly amount will be £30; and if payment has to be made for a broken period, say, to 15th January inclusive, the amount to be paid will be \( \frac{1}{4} \) (in leap-year \( \frac{1}{4} \) of £30.)

361. It is important that the Secretary of State should be furnished with an immediate and direct advice of every Bill that may be drawn on the credit of the Grants in aid; and this advice should be despatched at once so as to ensure, as far as possible, that it may reach this country as soon as the Bill itself. A duplicate of the advice should be sent by the first subsequent opportunity. It will no longer be necessary that separate advices should in these cases be sent to the Treasury or Paymaster-General. Salary Bills should be advised in the Form given in Appendix 13 (the serial number being added). The advice of other Bills should contain all the particulars given in the Bills themselves.

362. In all cases in which sums have been voted by Parliament for specified Salaries and Allowances, the Bills correctly drawn by a Governor for his own Salary, &c., or in favour of a subordinate Officer for that Officer's Salary, &c., will, if duly endorsed, be taken by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as sufficient final discharges; but where sums have been voted by Parliament, not for payment of Salary, but for particular Colonial services or, in terms still more comprehensive, in aid of Colonial Revenue, the Comptroller of Audit will require evidence of the proper application of the money. With this view it will, in such cases, be necessary that the advice of a Bill should be accompanied (or, if that would not be possible without delaying the advice, then followed immediately) by a Certificate, to be signed by the Colonial Treasurer, or other Officer acting in that capacity, and countersigned by the Governor himself, to the effect that the money had been carried to the credit of the Colonial Revenue. The same course should be adopted in the case of Advances from the Treasury Chest for other services than Salaries specified in the Parliamentary Votes. Copies of the Forms to be used for this purpose are given in Appendix 13a (p. 368). In the absence of these Certificates, the amounts of the Bills, or of the Advances from the Treasury Chests, will ordinarily be charged as Imprests against the Governor.

362a. In any cases in which money has been voted by Parliament for specially named Colonial Services, documentary evidence must be furnished that the money has been applied to the particular Service for which it was voted. On this point special instructions will be given to the Governors concerned.

363. When Salaries are specified in the Parliamentary Votes, Income Tax will be levied on them, under the General Rules laid down in Paragraphs 365 to 368 of the Regulations.

363a. When Salaries are not specified in the Parliamentary Grants, it is undesirable that Bills should be drawn for the actual Salaries of the Governor or other Colonial Officers. The Secretary of State will, however, be prepared to consider any special circumstances under which a departure from this rule may be desired. It will be proper as a general practice that the Governor should draw for round sums as Imprests on account of the Parliamentary Grant in aid, which Imprests should, of course, be carried to the credit of the Colonial Revenue. From that Revenue, Salaries not specified in the Parliamentary Grant should be paid without any deduction on account of the Imperial Income Tax.

364. Governors and other Officers whose Salaries are specified in the Parliamentary Votes, and who may elect to have their Salaries paid through the medium of Agents in this country, can continue so to do. In lieu, however, of the Life Certificates hitherto used, a formal order on the Paymaster-General must be obtained by the Agents from this Department. When Governors and Lieutenant-Governors or Administrators shall, in the first instance, have signified the mode in which their salary shall be drawn, it will be desirable that they should adhere to that mode.

365. All salaries and personal allowances and emoluments, and all pensions and superannuations, retired or compassionate allowances, paid from funds derived from the revenues of Great Britain, whether provided by special Parliamentary Grant or otherwise, are liable to the Income Tax unless the whole annual income of the recipient so derived is such as to entitle him to claim (1) exemption, or (2) abatement, under the Income Tax Act in force for the time being. In the latter case the balance of the income derived from the Parliamentary Grant or from other sources arising within or from the United Kingdom, after deducting such sum as may be specified in the Act, will be taxable. It will therefore be the duty of the Governor on all occasions to make the proper deductions accordingly from the amount of the bills which he may have occasion in future to draw on the
Paymaster-General, whether on his own account or for the salaries or allowances of other persons; and he will convey an intimation to the same effect to any Officers or Functionaries within his Government, who may be authorised to draw bills on the Paymaster-General for any such payments.

366. In cases where total or partial exemption may be claimed from the Tax, an affidavit must be made by the claimants and transmitted with the bill, to the effect that his income from sources arising within or from the United Kingdom, including that on account of which the bill is drawn, does not exceed the limits prescribed in the Income Tax Act in force for the time being as entitling him to exemption or abatement.

367. When bills are drawn on account of expenses or disbursements as well as for salaries and allowances, a statement of the proportion of the amount applicable to the latter must accompany them, and the proper deductions should be made from the salaries and allowances, unless exemption should be claimed, in which case affidavits ought to accompany the bills.

368. The Forms, to be filled up by persons claiming total or partial exemption from the tax, are inserted in the Appendix. (These can be obtained from the Paymaster-General.)

§ IV. Expenses on account of Liberated Africans.—Mode of rendering the Accounts of Expenses incurred under the Provisions of the Acts for the Abolition of the Slave Trade.

369. The Collectors or chief Officers of the Customs in those Colonies where no other arrangement has been specially directed are to receive, protect, and provide for all such Natives of Africa as may be put in their charge from vessels condemned as prize.

370. The Collector or other Officer is authorized to enter into the requisite contracts, to be approved by the Officer administering the Government, for the maintenance of the Africans at a fixed rate per diem, and for defraying the cost of clothing, necessaries, and other contingencies. This mode of supporting the Africans is considered preferable to that of purchasing provisions in large quantities for their use.

371. The Collector or other Officer will bring in the abstracts of accounts of his expenses, to be passed before the Officer administering the Government in Council, every three months. A certificate, to be signed by the Officer administering the Government, is to be subjoined to the General Abstract of the Expenditure, stating that the detailed documents referred to in the abstract have been carefully inspected, and have been approved.

372. In those cases in which the Colony is dependent on a Superior Government, the Abstracts of Expenditure, when certified by the Officer in charge of the subordinate Government, are to be forwarded to the Governor-in-Chief for his inspection and approval previously to the amount being discharged. Upon the passing of each quarterly account by the Officer administering the Government in Council, and in the case of subordinate Governments upon the subsequent approval of the Governor-in-Chief being signified, the abstract will be returned to the Collector, in whose favour the Officer administering the Government will thereupon grant a Warrant on the Treasury Chest for the amount allowed. The Officer granting such warrant will forthwith transmit a notification and report thereof to the Lords of the Treasury, and will forward with such notification a copy of the account, in discharge of which the issue from the Chest has been authorized. Any neglect of these forms will be productive of embarrassment and delay.

373. Governors are strictly enjoined to abstain from drawing for and issuing for this service any allowance or gratuity of which the propriety or legality may admit of a doubt, until they shall have communicated with and received instructions from Her Majesty's Government on the subject; and they are to limit the payments in the meantime to the amount of the actual outlay for the maintenance and other unavoidable expenses.

374. If any sums shall have been issued, paid, or expended by their order, which ought not to have been so issued, paid, or expended, or ought not to be charged to the public, they will become personally responsible for the amount, under the provisions of the 1 & 2 Geo. 4, cap. 121, sec. 5.

375. With a due regard, therefore, to their own security, as well as the interests of the public, Governors must at all times exercise a watchful superintendence and control over the expenditure to which these Regulations refer, and enforce the strictest economy consistent with the welfare of the African and the good of the Service.

CHAPTER XII.

§ I. Trade and Navigation.

376. The Customs Establishments in all the Colonies are under the control and management of the several Colonial Governments, and the Colonial Legislatures are empowered to establish their own Customs Regulations and Rates of Duty.

377. The Imperial Act 16 & 17 Vict., c. 107, s. 324-5, provides for a freedom of navigation between the United Kingdom, or the British Possessions and Foreign Countries. But with a view of placing British Ships in Foreign Ports as nearly as possible on the same footing as Foreign Ships in British Ports, the Crown has the power, by Order in Council, of restricting the privileges of Foreign Ships, and of imposing additional Duties, in cases in which British Ships may be subject in any Foreign Country to Prohibitions or Restrictions from which the Ships of that Country are exempt, or in which any Preference whatever may be shown to National Vessels over British Vessels, or in which British Trade and Navigation is not placed by such Country upon as advantageous a footing as the Trade and Navigation of the most favoured Nation.
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

378. Cancelled by Circular 24th July, 1889.

379. Under sec. 89 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, the Governor is intrusted with the powers which, in respect to the Registry of Ships or of any interest therein, are vested by the Act in the Commissioners of Customs in England. It is to the Governor, therefore, that the Registrars of Shipping are directed to look for instructions.

380. The Governor usually appoints the Collectors of Customs in the Colony to act as Registrars of Shipping and Superintendents of Mercantile Marine under the Merchant Shipping Acts, the duties of the Registrars and Superintendents being defined in the Instructions which are issued from time to time by the Board of Trade, with the sanction of the Secretary of State.

381. It being, however, important for statistical purposes that information respecting the Trade and Navigation of the Colony should be forwarded to the Home Government, the points enumerated in the following sections should have the Governor's careful attention.

§ II. Shipping.

382. Particulars of the Registry, Mortgage, Sale, or Loss of Ships should be forwarded by Registrars of Shipping in the Colonies to the Chief Registrar of Shipping, Custom House, London, and of the changes in the appointments of Masters of Ships to the Registrar-General of Seamen, Adelaide Place, London Bridge, by the next mail after the transaction takes place.

383. The Registry of a Ship should be reported in the Customs Form 19, and the transactions subsequent to her Registry, such as her Sale, Mortgage, or other Dealings, in Customs Form 20. In these Forms the full address of each Owner should be given, and the letters M.O. marked against the name of the Managing Owner, if there are more Owners than one. The Certificate of all closed and cancelled Registries should be forwarded to the Chief Registrar of Shipping, with a memorandum thereon, stating the grounds of closing or cancelling the Register. When the Certificate of Registry is lost, a Form, No. 20, should be sent, giving the date and particulars of the closing the Registry, and the loss of the Certificate. The changes in the appointments of Masters which are endorsed on the Certificate of Registry, should be reported to the Registrar-General of Seamen in Form 21, or by letter.

384. At the end of each year the Registrar of Shipping should prepare and transmit to the Chief Registrar of Shipping, Custom House, London, an Account made up to 31st December, showing:—

(a.) The Names, &c., of all Ships on the Register Books of the Port on the previous 1st January.

(b.) The Names, &c., of all Ships registered at the Port during the year, distinguishing those Vessels in the List which have been lost, sold to Foreigners, or transferred to other Ports. At the end of the List an Abstract should be given of the Number and Tonnage of Vessels belonging to the Port on 31st December. This List should be transmitted as early as possible in the month of January, and as these Returns are the foundation of Statistical information laid before Parliament, too much care cannot be exercised by Registrars in ensuring their accuracy.

§ III. Seamen.

385. The duties which Superintendents of Mercantile Marine are required to perform in respect to Merchant Seamen are detailed in their Instructions. The principal point which requires the attention of the Governor, is the necessity for the Home Government being furnished with the Board of Trade Return, CC 21, by each mail. This Return materially assists in tracing the whereabouts of Naval Volunteers who have left their Ships, it also enables the Home Government to obtain from Shipowners repayment of expenses incurred in relieving Seamen who have been left behind sick, and payment of the Wages of Crews where Ships are lost with all papers.

§ IV. Lighthouses, &c.

386. Notice of any new Lighthouses, Buoys, or Beacons placed or erected on the shores of the British Possessions abroad, and of any alterations in those already existing, should be forwarded as early as possible by the Governor through the Secretary of State, in a Memorandum addressed to the Board of Trade, who will communicate to the Admiralty for publication. A Form of Notice of a new Light, or alteration of a Light, is inserted in the Appendix (page 369).

387. Any new facts with regard to Navigation, such as the formation or discovery of new Reefs, Shoals, Currents, &c., should also be sent home as early as possible, in the same manner and for the same purpose.

§ V. Wrecks.

388. For the purposes of the Wreck Abstract annually presented to Parliament, particulars of every casualty to Shipping on the shores of any British Possession abroad, or to any British Shipping at sea, concerning which information can be obtained, should be forwarded by the proper Colonial Officer to the Board of Trade, in Board of Trade Form Wr. I. (Colonial),* at the earliest opportunity after the occurrence, and an Abstract of such casualties should if possible be forwarded to the Board of Trade at the end of every year.

Forms for the Return and the Abstract will be supplied on application to the Board of Trade.

CHAPTER XIII.

(389-401 cancelled by Circular of 15th December, 1888.)

* Form no longer in use.—(Ed. C. O. List.)
CHAPTER XIV.

§ I. Naturalization.

402. The naturalization of aliens in the Colonies is now effected under authority of the Naturalization Acts, 1870 (33 Vic., cap. 14, and 33 and 34 Vic., cap. 102),* which empower the Legislature of every Colony to confer on aliens by law all or any of the privileges of naturalization within such Colony.

403. When any measure for such a purpose is proposed, the Governor should take care that words are inserted in the statute confining such privileges to the limits of the Colony.

§ II. Passports of naturalized British Subjects in the Colonies.

404. Governors are authorised to issue Passports for foreign travel to persons naturalized in their respective Colonies. The Form of Passport is inserted in the Appendix (page 370). These Passports must be signed by the Governor, and must contain an express declaration that the person receiving the Passport has been naturalized as a British subject in the Colony.†

CHAPTER XV.

Applications for Opinions of Law Officers in this Country.

405. If in any case a Colonial Government or Legislature desire to obtain the opinion of the English Law Officers on any important question of Law which may have arisen in the administration of the Colony, it is necessary that the Secretary of State should be furnished with a detailed statement explaining precisely what doubts have arisen, and under what circumstances, enumerating the Instruments or Laws bearing on these doubts (of which complete copies should in all cases be annexed), setting forth, verbatim, the particular provisions of these Instruments or Laws which appear relevant to the matter in hand, and in conclusion stating explicitly the particular questions to which answers are desired. All papers so furnished for consideration of the English law officers should be sent in duplicate.

CHAPTER XVI.

§ I. Criminal Trials.

406. No Judge presiding on a criminal trial must, upon any account, fail to take notes of the evidence adduced; and no capital Sentence must be executed until the Governor of the Colony shall have perused those notes.

407. In general no reference, in criminal cases, is to be made from the Government of any Colony to this Country, with a view to the confirmation or remission of Sentences pronounced by the Colonial Courts. But Her Majesty's Government will be ready to afford any information, instructions, or advice for which the Governor may think it necessary to apply, whenever any question may arise on any criminal proceeding on which there may be any special and adequate motive for invoking the interference of Her Majesty's Government in this Country. Whenever a capital sentence shall have been executed, a report of it must be transmitted to the Secretary of State. (See Circular Despatch, 14th November, 1877.)

Every case should be reported to the Secretary of State in which, after sentence of death, a pardon is granted, or the capital Sentence is commuted, or the commuted Sentence is remitted. (See Circular Despatch of 5th May, 1882.)

408. Under the Act 12 & 13 Vic. c. 96, all persons charged in any Colony with offences committed on the Sea, or in places within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, may be dealt with in the same manner as if the offences had been committed on waters within the local jurisdiction of the Courts of the Colony.‡

§ II. Surrender of Criminals.

409. Offenders accused of committing offences within Her Majesty's dominions may be returned to the part where the offence was committed in the manner prescribed by the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881 (44 and 45 Vic. c. 69). (See also Circulars of 11th Mar., 1882, 21st Sept., 1882, and 16th July, 1883.)

410. Offenders accused of committing offences in a foreign country may be returned to that country in the manner prescribed by the Extradition Acts, 1870 and 1873 (33 and 34 Vic., c. 52, and 36 and 37 Vic., c. 60), provided an Extradition Treaty exists with that country.¶

411. These Acts impose duties upon the Governors of Colonies, who should, whenever demand is made for the surrender of an offender (British or foreign), refer carefully to them, as well as to the Order in Council containing the text of the Treaty and putting it into effect.

412. The following is a list of the Extradition Treaties in force up to October, 1888:

| Extradition Treaties in Force |

† By Circular of 23rd September, 1891, Governors have been informed that they are at liberty at their discretion to issue passports to British-born subjects. &c also Circular, 1st Aug., 1895.

‡ As to sentences proper to be passed in such cases, see the Colonial Courts Jurisdiction Act, 37 and 38 Vic., cap. 37.

¶ For Memo. of Instructions as to Extradition Procedure, see Circular of 30th April, 1890.

§ III.—Removal of Colonial Prisoners.

413. By the Colonial Prisoners' Removal Act, 1869 (32 and 33 Vic., c. 10), any two Colonies, with the sanction of the Queen in Council, may agree for the removal of any prisoners from one to the other for the purpose of undergoing their punishment in that other Colony.

414. By the Colonial Prisoners' Removal Act, 1884 (47 and 48 Vic., c. 31), the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Governments of the Colonies concerned, may order the removal of a particular prisoner, if he falls within the categories specified in the Act, from one Colony to another, or to the United Kingdom, to undergo his sentence or the residue thereof.

415. Criminal lunatics may also be removed in a similar manner under the Act of 1884.

§ IV.—Apprehension of Deserters from Merchant Vessels.

416. The Act 15 and 16 Vic., c. 26 (1852) enables the Crown to carry into effect arrangements with foreign powers for the apprehension and surrender of seamen, not being slaves, who may desert from merchant vessels belonging to a subject of such powers when within Her Majesty's dominions. The following list shows the arrangements (in the shape of treaties, conventions, agreements, declarations, notifications, and Orders in Council) at present existing between Great Britain and the foreign powers named for the mutual surrender of merchant seamen deserters.

### CHAPTER XVII.

**Presents.**

421—1. Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, and all other Servants of the Crown in a Colony are prohibited from receiving Presents offered for their personal acceptance by Kings, Chiefs, or other Members of the Native population, in or neighbouring to such Colony.

422—2. When such Presents cannot be absolutely refused without giving offence, they are to be delivered up to the Government. To this rule there can be no exception, unless with the express sanction of the Secretary of State.

423—3. When Presents are exchanged between Governors or other Officers acting on behalf of the Colonial Government in ceremonial intercourses with Native Chiefs, Rulers, or others, the Presents received must be credited to the Government, and such return Presents, as may be sanctioned by the Secretary of State, will be given at the Government expense.

### CHAPTER XVIII.*

Special Rules as to Leave of Absence, Passages, and Pensions of European Officers on the West Coast of Africa.

424. Subject to the necessities of the Service, officers, including Governors and Administrators, who were not themselves born in West Africa, and whose parents were neither of them born there, may be granted six months' leave of absence, on full pay, after they have completed (1) in Sierra Leone and the Gambia, fifteen, and (2) in the Gold Coast Colony and Lagos, twelve, consecutive months of residential service; and if specially detained by the Governor on public grounds, after the completion of a tour of service, they may be granted ten days' leave on full pay for each calendar month that they may have been detained, but no additional leave will be granted in respect of any fraction of a month.

* See Circulars 20th November, 1884, and 13th May, 1885.

This West African leave may be extended with half salary on a medical certificate, but the extension must not exceed three months. Any extension, however short, which may be granted on any other ground than that of ill-health must be without salary.

425. Officers invalided before completing a tour of residential service may, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, be allowed ten days' sick leave with full pay for each completed calendar month, and such further leave, with half pay, as will make six months in all. They may also be granted leave, without pay, for a period of not more than three months before being called upon to resign.

If invalided out of the Colony, but not to the United Kingdom, they may either draw full pay, and pay all their own expenses, or draw half pay and have their passages paid by the Government, as the Governor may decide.

426. Officers desiring leave on the ground of "urgent private affairs" before completing a tour of residential service, may, if specially recommended by the Governor, be allowed leave without salary, or, if they have completed six months of residential service, leave on half salary, at the discretion of the Secretary of State; but such leave must in no case exceed four months.

427. Officers to whom the three foregoing regulations apply are required to discharge any duties upon which the Governor may think it desirable to employ them; and they are not entitled to receive any available half salary under the 107th and 108th regulations in addition to the salary of their own office, for performing the duties of an office vacated by the death or removal or temporary absence of the holder. They will, however, draw the duty allowance, when acting in any office to which such an allowance is attached.

428. Free passages home and out again will be allowed to all officers under the rank of Governor who may be granted leave of absence under the 424th and 425th regulations, and a free passage to the West Coast will be allowed on their first appointment to all subordinate officers whose salaries do not exceed £600 per annum, but passages will not be granted to wives or children under the 153rd regulation.

429. The following exceptional advantages are allowed to officers on retirement. In all other respects the general rules and limitations relating to pensions and gratuities are strictly applied.

1. Officers become eligible for pension at the age of 55; which is also the age when they may be required to accept their pensions and retire, unless their further continuance in the West African service is specially sanctioned by the Secretary of State. No officer can retire with a pension or gratuity before that age, unless he is incapable from infirmity of mind or body of discharging the duties of his situation.

2. The minimum term of service qualifying an officer to receive a pension in case of bodily or mental incapacity is seven years instead of ten.

3. For each year of pensionable African service, there is allowed in the pension one fortieth (instead of one sixtieth) of the officer's salary; but no pension may exceed two-thirds of the retiring officer's emoluments on the ordinary basis.

4. In cases of less than seven years' service the gratuity is computed at the rate of 12½ per cent. of the annual salary (instead of 8½ per cent.) for each year of service.

5. In the service, for the purposes of pension or gratuity, is included all authorised leave on full or half salary, except in the cases described in the 102nd regulation.

These rules do not however apply to service prior to the 14th September, 1874.

430. The foregoing regulations (424 to 429) do not apply to officers who were themselves born in West Africa, or whose parents were either of them born there. All such officers are subject to the general regulations as to leave of absence, passages, and gratuities or pensions, with the exception that they will not be entitled to any salary under the 107th and 108th regulations, unless it be available. They will, however, in lieu of such salary, draw the duty allowance when acting in any office to which such allowance is attached. In the case of one of the aforesaid officers acting for an officer on full pay leave, and not receiving any duty allowance, the Governor may, if he think fit, award a gratuity in respect of such acting service, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. On the other hand, the regulations numbered 119, 120, 123, 124, 132, 133, and 134, do not apply to officers entitled to the benefit of the special regulations.

CHAPTER XIX.

Interchange of Visits between Officers of Her Majesty's Ships and Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, Administrators, and Presidents of Colonies.

§ 431—1. A Governor is to receive the first visit from all Naval Officers in command.

2. A Lieutenant-Governor is to pay the first visit to a Flag Officer or Commodore of the 1st Class, being a Commander-in-Chief, but to receive the first visit from all other Officers.

3. An Administrator or President is to pay the first visit to all Flag Officers or Commodores, but to receive the first visit from all other Officers.

4. Return visits are to be paid within 24 hours, and in person, to all Flag Officers, Commodores, Lieutenant-Governors, Administrators, and Presidents; but by an Aide-de-Camp or other Officer deputed by the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Administrator, or President, as the case may be, to all other Naval Officers.

5. Should the Governor or any other Officer administering the Government of a Colony find that from indisposition or pressure of important business he is unable to pay or return these visits in person, he will depute his Aide-de-Camp or some other Officer to do so. In like manner, should a Flag Officer or Commodore from indisposition or pressing occupation be precluded from paying or returning these visits, he will depute his Flag Lieutenant, or other Officer not below that rank, to do so. In each case the Officer failing to pay the required visit in person will report the circumstance, and assign the reasons which led to the omission, to the Department under which he is acting.
6. Officers acting temporarily in higher civil offices or commands are in respect to these visits to be upon the same footing as if they were confirmed in such offices or commands.

7. The Senior Naval Officers present will arrange, when necessary, to provide suitable boats to enable Governors, &c., to pay any official visits afloat, and to reland them, on their notifying their wishes to that effect. (See also Circular, 7th March, 1879, enclosing the above Regulations.)

CHAPTER XX.
Use of Flags.

§432.—1. The Royal Standard shall be flown at Government House on the Queen's Birthday, and on the days of Her Majesty's Accession and Coronation.

2. The Union Flag, without the Badge of the Colony, shall be flown at Government House from sunrise to sunset on other days.

3. The Union Flag, with the approved Arms or Badge of the Colony, as shown in the drawing in the circular despatch of the 23rd August, 1875, emblazoned in the centre thereof, surrounded by a green garland, shall be used by Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, or Officers Administering the Government of Colonies or Dependencies when embarked in boats or other vessels.

4. The British Blue Ensign, with the Arms or Badge of the Colony emblazoned on the fly (as shown in the drawing enclosed in the circular despatch of the 23rd of August, 1875), and the pendant, will be flown by all armed vessels in the employ of the Government of a Colony.

5. The British Blue Ensign, with the Arms or Badge of the Colony emblazoned thereon, as described in the preceding section, but without the pendant, will be flown by vessels which belong to, or are in the service of, the Government of a Colony, but not armed.

6. All other vessels registered as belonging to one of Her Majesty's Colonies or Dependencies will fly the Red Ensign without any Badge (See Section 73 (1) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894). There will, however, be no objection to Colonial Merchant Vessels carrying distinguishing flags with the Badge of the Colony thereon, in addition to the Red Ensign, provided that such flag does not infringe the limits laid down in Section 73 (2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.

7. Whenever a requisition is received by any Officer in command of one of Her Majesty's Ships for the embarkation or conveyance of a Governor, High Commissioner, Lieutenant-Governor, or Officer administering the Government of a Colony or Dependency, the Senior Officer present may direct the Special Flag of such official personage to be hoisted at the foretop-gallant masthead of the ship in which he is embarked; provided that he, after consultation with, and on requisition from, that official, considers it for the benefit of the service about to be performed that such flag should be hoisted, and provided that it is only hoisted or carried within the limits of His Government or High Commission in which he would be entitled to be saluted under Article 18, page 4, of the Queen's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, 1879.

8. If the Senior Officer considers it, in any circumstances, undesirable to hoist the Flag, he will inform the Governor, High Commissioner, &c., of his reasons, and will at once report the same to the Admiralty.

9. In the event of a Governor, High Commissioner, &c., of a Colony being detached on a Foreign Mission in his official capacity as Governor or High Commissioner, special instructions will be issued in each case as to the Flag which should be carried by a man-of-war in which he may be embarked; in the absence of which the Senior Officer present will exercise his discretion in consultation with the Official proceeding on the mission.

18. Statement, if the circumstances warrant it, that the applicant "has discharged his duties with diligence and fidelity, to the satisfaction of the Head Officer or Officers of his Department," to be signed by any two of such Head Officers, if there shall be more than one, or by such Head Officer, if there shall be but one, together with "such a statement as will exhibit the merit, and value, and labour of the services of the person recommended, embracing as long a period of his public service as can be authentically stated," and observations as to special services, suspension, reprimand, &c., with full particulars of any injuries received on duty, or other claims or matters for consideration.

19. Computation, by the Auditor-General, of the pension, &c.

I certify that the amount which may be paid to the applicant according to the Rules of the Colonial Service, amounts to and I base my certificate on the following calculation:

Instructions referred to on preceding page.

If this paper of particulars, and the certificates connected with it, be not sent in original, the copies must be duly attested.

Head 1 of Paper.—In the case of an Officer serving on the West Coast of Africa, a statement is to be added whether he is a native of that coast.—(Colonial Regulations, § 430.)

Head 3.—State the description of allowance for which the applicant is recommended, viz., superannuation, compensation, compassionate allowance, or gratuity, and its amount. In the case of persons claiming an addition to their pensions in respect of professional or other special qualifications, this should be stated, and a reference should be given to the authority under which the claim is made.

Head 5.—If the service has been interrupted by one or more breaks, the word "broken" should be added before or after the number of years and months, and the causes, dates, and circumstances of the break or breaks should be stated under heading 9.

Head 6.—If the person retiring has been in receipt of the same salary, or in the class from which he retires, for the 36 months immediately before the date of his retirement, the actual annual rate of salary or wages at that date should be inserted, preceded by the word "actual." In other cases the average annual amount of salary or wages for the 36 months next preceding the date of retirement should be inserted, preceded by the word "average;" but if the whole period of service is less than three years, then the average for the whole period of service should be inserted.

Head 7.—A separate statement should be inserted of the average annual value, for the 36 months immediately preceding retirement, of each emolument (exclusive of salary or wages) which is claimed to be included in the calculation of the pension or gratuity.

Whenever the value of a house or house allowance, so ascertained, exceeds one-sixth of the salary and other emoluments which count for pension purposes, it is to be reduced to one-sixth of that amount, so that it shall not exceed one-seventh of the whole.

Fees which an officer is allowed to retain for his own use will be taken into account for pension purposes, with regular salary, at the annual average of the net receipts of the 36 months next preceding the officer's retirement. These net receipts are to be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of fees such officer expenses, &c., as an officer may have had to defray from his own resources, in performing the services for which he was remunerated by fees. No deduction, however, from the fees should be made in respect of office expenses provided from public funds, for the due discharge of those duties to which a fixed salary is annexed. Papers of "particulars" when forwarded to the Colonial Department, should be accompanied by formal declarations from the retiring officers, showing the amount received by them for fees, and the amount defrayed as above for office expenses, &c., in each of the three years immediately preceding the retirement. It will be the duty of the Colonial Governments concerned to satisfy themselves of the accuracy of such statements before forwarding them to the Colonial Office. In the case of officers receiving fixed salaries and fees, the fees will not in ordinary circumstances be allowed to count for pension purposes to the extent of more than one quarter of the salaries; and fees will not in any case be allowed to count for pension purposes during any period in which the whole time of the officer receiving them was not given to the public service.

Head 8.—In cases of infirmity, if the applicant is below the ordinary age for retirement, a medical certificate is to be furnished showing that he is disqualified by infirmity of mind or body for discharge in the duties of his situation, and that such infirmity is likely to be permanent.

In case of ten years' service or more, this certificate should be signed by two Officers, of whom at least one should, if possible, be a salaried Officer of the Government.
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

Head 9.—As to "broken" service, see Head 8.

If the applicant has had any "acting" service, the details must be fully given, with a statement whether or not, during the "acting" service, he was connected with the permanent Civil Service of the Colony.

Head 11.—If, in special circumstances, a professional civil Officer has been allowed to have "private practice" without forfeiting his claim to pension, the facts are to be fully stated.

Head 14.—If the applicant is liable to any deduction from his service under Clause 102 of the Colonial Regulations, the facts should be fully stated.

Head 19.—The length of service and other particulars of the computation are to be given. When an average of salary, &c., is taken, the mode of calculating it (whether by months, &c.) is to be explained.

N.B.—This Form of Particulars is not at present used in Ceylon and the Straits Settlements, for which Colonies special Forms have been approved.—(See Despatches to Governors of those Colonies, 19th December, 1879.)

VICTORIA R.

WHEREAS We, taking into Our Royal Consideration that there exists no means of adequately rewarding the individual gallant services either of Officers of the lower grades in Our Naval and Military Service, or of Warrant and Petty Officers, Seamen, and Marines in Our Navy, and Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers in Our Army; and whereas the Third Class of Our Most Honorable Order of the Bath is limited, except in very rare cases, to the higher ranks of both Services, and the granting of medals, both in Our Navy and Army, is only awarded for long service or meritorious conduct, rather than for bravery in action or distinction before an enemy, such cases alone excepted where a general medal is granted for a particular action or campaign, or a clasp added to the medal for some especial engagement, in both of which cases all share equally in the boon, and those who by their valour have particularly signalized themselves remain undistinguished from their comrades: Now, for the purpose of attaining an end so desirable as that of rewarding individual instances of merit and valour, We have instituted and created and by these Presents, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, institute and create a New Naval and Military Decoration, which we are desirous should be highly prized and eagerly sought
after by the Officers and Men of Our Naval and Military Services, and are graciously pleased to make ordain, and establish the following rules and ordinances for the government of the same, which shall from henceforth be inviolably observed and kept:

Firstly. It is ordained, that the distinction shall be styled and designated "the Victoria Cross," and shall consist of a Maltese Cross of Bronze, with Our Royal Crest in the centre, and underneath which an escroll, bearing this inscription, "For Valour."

Secondly. It is ordained, that the Cross shall be suspended from the left breast, by a blue riband for the Navy, and by a red riband for the Army.

Thirdly. It is ordained, that the names of those upon whom We may be pleased to confer the Decoration shall be published in the "London Gazette," and a registry thereof kept in the office of Our Secretary of State for War.

Fourthly. It is ordained, that any one who, after having received the Cross, shall again perform an act of bravery, which, if he had not received such Cross, would have entitled him to it, such further act shall be recorded by a Bar attached to the riband by which the Cross is suspended, and for every additional act of bravery an additional Bar may be added.

Fifthly. It is ordained, that the Cross shall only be awarded to those Officers or men who have served Us in the presence of the enemy, and shall have then performed some signal act of valour or devotion to their country.

Sixthly. It is ordained, with a view to place all persons on a perfectly equal footing in relation to eligibility for the Decoration, that neither rank, nor long service, nor wounds, nor any other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of conspicuous bravery, shall be held to establish a sufficient claim to the honour.

Seventhly. It is ordained, that the Decoration may be conferred on the spot where the act to be rewarded by the grant of such Decoration has been performed, under the following circumstances:

I. When the Fleet or Army in which such act has been performed is under the eye and command of an Admiral or General Officer commanding the Forces.

II. Where the Naval or Military force is under the eye and command of an Admiral or Commodore commanding a squadron or detached naval force, or of a General commanding a corps, or division, or brigade on a distinct and detached service, when such Admiral, Commodore, or General Officer shall have the power of conferring the Decoration on the spot, subject to confirmation by us.

Eighthly. It is ordained, where such act shall not have been performed in sight of a Commanding Officer as aforesaid, then the claimant for the honour shall prove the act to the satisfaction of the Captain or Officer commanding his ship, or to the Officer commanding the regiment to which the claimant belongs, and such Captain or such Commanding Officer shall report the same through the usual channel to the Admiral or Commodore commanding the force employed on the service, or to the Officer commanding the forces in the field, who shall call for such description and attestation of the act as he may think requisite, and on approval shall recommend the grant of the Decoration.

Ninthly. It is ordained, that every person selected for the Cross, under rule seven, shall be publicly decorated before the Naval or Military force or body to which he belongs, and with which the act of bravery for which he is to be rewarded shall have been performed, and his name shall be recorded in a General Order, together with the cause of his especial distinction.

Tenthly. It is ordained, that every person selected under rule eight shall receive his Decoration as soon as possible, and his name shall likewise appear in a General Order as above required, such General Order to be issued by the Naval or Military Commandor of the Forces employed on the service.

Eleventhly. It is ordained, that the General Orders above referred to shall from time to time be transmitted to Our Secretary of State for War, to be laid before Us, and shall be by him registered.

Twelfthly. It is ordained, that as cases may arise not falling within the rules above specified, or in which a claim, though well founded, may not have been established on the spot, We will, on the joint submission of Our Secretary of State for War and of Our Commander-in-Chief of Our Army, or on that of Our Lord High Admiral or Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in the case of the Navy, confer the Decoration, but never without conclusive proof of the performance of the act of bravery for which the claim is made.

Thirteenthly. It is ordained, that in the event of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, a detached body of Seamen and Marines, not under fifty in number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop, or company, in which the Admiral, General, or other Officer commanding such forces, may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that no special selection can be made by them; then in such case the Admiral, General, or other Officer commanding, may direct, that for any such body of Seamen or Marines, or for every troop or company of Soldiers, one Officer shall be selected by the Officers engaged for the Decoration; and in like manner one Petty Officer or Non-commissioned Officer shall be selected by the Petty Officers and Non-commissioned Officers engaged; and two Seamen or Private Soldiers or Marines shall be selected by the Seamen, or Private Soldiers, or Marines, engaged respectively, for the Decoration; and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the Senior Officer in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment, troop, or company, to the Admiral or General Officer commanding, who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts were done under his own eye.

Fourteenthly. It is ordained, that every Warrant Officer, Petty Officer, Seaman, or Marine, or Non-commissioned Officer or Soldier, who shall have received the Cross, shall, from the date of the act by which the Decoration has been gained, be entitled to a Special Pension of Ten Pounds a year, and each additional Bar conferred under rule four on such Warrant or Petty Officers, or Non-commissioned Officers or Men, shall carry with it an Additional Pension of Five Pounds per annum.

Fifteenthly. In order to make such additional provision as shall effectually preserve pure this most honourable distinction it is ordained, that if any person on whom such distinction shall be conferred be convicted of treason, cowardice, felony, or of any infamous crime, or if he be accused of any such offence, and doth not after a reasonable time surrender himself to be tried for the same his name shall
forthwith be erased from the registry of individuals upon whom the said Decoration shall have been conferred, by an especial Warrant under Our Royal Sign Manual, and the Pension conferred under rule fourteen shall cease and determine from the Date of such Warrant. It is hereby further declared that We, Our Heirs and successors, shall be the sole judges of the circumstance demanding such expulsion; moreover We shall at all times have power to restore such persons as may at any time have been expelled, both to the enjoyment of the Decoration and Pensions.

Given at Our Court at Buckingham Palace, this twenty-ninth of January, in the nineteenth year of Our Reign, and in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six.

WARRENT for extending the VICTORIA CROSS to the LOCAL FORCES in NEW ZEALAND and in the COLONIES and their DEPENDENCIES generally.

VICTORIA R.

VICTORIA, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith. To all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting:

WHEREAS by a Warrant under Our Royal Sign Manual, countersigned by one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, and bearing date, at Our Court at Buckingham Palace, the 29th day of January, 1856, in the nineteenth year of Our Reign, We did constitute and create a new Naval and Military Decoration, to be styled and designated the Victoria Cross, which Decoration We expressed our desire should be highly prized and eagerly sought after by the Officers and Men of Our Naval and Military Services, and did also make, ordain, and establish the Rules and Ordinances therein set forth for the government of the same, to be thenceforth inviolably observed and kept:

And whereas during the progress of the operations which We have undertaken against the Insurgent Native Tribes in Our Colony of New Zealand it has happened that persons serving in the Local Forces of Our said Colony have performed deeds of gallantry, in consideration of which they are not, according to the strict provisions of Our said recited Warrant, eligible for this high distinction:

Now know ye, that We of Our especial Grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, have thought fit hereby to signify Our Royal Will and Pleasure that the said Decoration may be conferred on such persons aforesaid, who may be qualified to receive the same in accordance with the Rules and Ordinances made, ordained, and established by Us for the government thereof, by Our said recited Warrant, and We do by these Presents, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, ordain and appoint that it shall be competent for such persons aforesaid to obtain the said Decoration in the manner set forth in the Rules and Ordinances referred to, or in accordance with such further Rules and Ordinances as may hereafter be made and promulgated by Us, Our Heirs and Successors, for the government of the said Decoration; provided that it be established in any case that the person was serving with Our Troops, under the Orders of a General or other Officer, under circumstances which would entitle an Officer or Soldier of Our Army to be recommended for the said Decoration, in accordance with the Rules and Ordinances prescribed in Our said recited Warrant, and provided also such person shall be recommended for it by such General or other Officer:

And We do further, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, ordain and appoint that the said Decoration may also be conferred, in accordance with the Rules and Ordinances prescribed in Our said recited Warrant, and subject to the provisions aforesaid, on such persons who may be qualified to receive the same in accordance with the said Rules and Ordinances as may hereafter be employed in the Local Forces raised or which may be raised in Our Colonies and their Dependencies, who may be called upon to serve in co-operation with Our Troops in military operations which it may be necessary to undertake for the suppression of Rebellion against Our Authority, or for repelling invasion by a foreign enemy.

Given at Our Court, at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, this First day of January, 1867, in the thirteenth year of Our Reign.

By Her Majesty's Command,

(Signed) J. PEEL.

7. (Par. 159.)

THE QUEEN has been pleased to direct that the following REGULATIONS respecting FOREIGN ORDERS and MEDALS shall be substituted for those now in force:

Regulations respecting Foreign Orders.

1. No subject of Her Majesty shall accept a Foreign Order from the Sovereign of any foreign country, or wear the insignia thereof, without having previously obtained Her Majesty's permission to that effect, signified by a warrant under Her Royal Sign Manual.

2. Excepting in the case of Special Complimentary Missions to Foreign Sovereigns, such permission shall not be granted to any subject of Her Majesty unless the Foreign Order shall have been conferred in consequence of active and distinguished service before the enemy, either at sea or in the field; or unless he shall have been actually and entirely employed, beyond Her Majesty's dominions, in the service of the Foreign Sovereign by whom the Order is conferred.

3. The intention of a Foreign Sovereign to confer upon a British subject the insignia of an Order must be notified to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, either through the British Minister accredited to the Court of such Foreign Sovereign, or through his Minister accredited at the Court of Her Majesty.

4. If the service for which it is proposed to confer the Order has been performed during war, the notification required by the preceding clause must be made not later than two years after the exchange of the Ratifications of a Treaty of Peace.

If the service has been performed in time of peace, the notification must be made within two years after the date of such service.
5. After such notification shall have been received, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shall, if the case comes within the conditions prescribed by the present Regulations, and arises from naval or military services before the enemy, refer it to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the War Department previously to taking Her Majesty's pleasure thereupon, in order to ascertain whether there be any objection to Her Majesty's permission being granted.

A similar reference shall also be made to the Commander-in-Chief if the application relates to an officer in the army, or to the Lords of the Admiralty if it relates to an officer in the navy.

6. When Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shall have taken the Queen's pleasure on any such application, and shall have obtained Her Majesty's permission for the person in whose favour it has been made to accept the Foreign Order and wear the insignia thereof, he shall signify the same to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, in order that he may cause the warrant required by clause 1 to be prepared for the Royal Sign Manual.

When such warrant shall have been signed by the Queen a notification thereof shall be inserted in the "Gazette," stating the service for which the Foreign Order has been conferred.

7. The warrant signifying Her Majesty's permission may, at the request and at the expense of the person who has obtained it, be registered in the College of Arms.

8. Every such warrant as aforesaid shall contain a clause providing that Her Majesty's license and permission does not authorize the assumption of any style, appellation, rank, precedence, or privilege appertaining to a Knight Bachelor of Her Majesty's realms.

9. When a British subject has received the Royal permission to accept a Foreign Order, he will at any future time be allowed to accept the decoration of a higher class of the same Order to which he may have become eligible by increase of rank in the foreign service or in the service of his own country, or any other distinctive mark of honour strictly consequent upon the acceptance of the original order, and common to every person upon whom such Order is conferred.

10. The preceding clause shall not be taken to apply to decorations of the Guelphic Order which were bestowed on British subjects by Her Majesty's predecessors King George IV. and King William IV., on whose heads the crowns of Great Britain and of Hanover were united.

Decorations so bestowed cannot properly be considered as rewards granted by a Foreign Sovereign for services rendered according to the purport of clause 2 of these Regulations. They must be rather considered as personal favours bestowed on British subjects by British Sovereigns, and as having no reference to services rendered to the Foreign Crown of Hanover.

Foreign Office, February 3, 1886.

Regulations respecting Foreign Medals.

1. Applications for permission to accept and wear Medals which, not being the decoration of any Foreign Order, are conferred by a Foreign Sovereign on British subjects in the army or navy, should be addressed to the Commander-in-Chief or the Lords of the Admiralty, as the case may be, who, if they see fit, may submit the same for Her Majesty's sanction; upon obtaining which they may grant such permission without other formality.

2. Any other British subject, having obtained Her Majesty's permission, is at liberty to accept and wear a Foreign Medal, not being the Decoration of a Foreign Order.

3. No permission is necessary for accepting a Foreign Medal, if such Medal is not to be worn.

ENGROSSING AND ENROLLING OF BILLS.

"Die Jovis, 8° Februarii, 1849."

"Resolved, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled,—

1. That it is expedient to discontinue the present system of Engrossing, and to alter the present system of Enrolling Bills, and to make such provisions in lieu thereof as are hereinafter mentioned.

2. That this House is prepared to agree to the following arrangements, if agreed to by the other House of Parliament."

I. That in lieu of being engrossed, every Bill shall be fair printed immediately after it shall have been passed in the House in which it originated, and that such fair printed Bill shall be sent to the other House, as the Bill so passed, and shall (subject to the regulation next hereinafter mentioned) be dealt with by that House and its Officers, in the same manner in which Engrossed Bills are now dealt with.

II. That on its Return to the House in which it originated, without Amendments (or if amended, after the Amendments shall have been settled and agreed to), it shall be fair printed by the Queen's Printer, who shall furnish a fair print thereof on vellum to the House of Lords, before the Royal Assent, and likewise a duplicate of such fair print, also on vellum.

III. That one of such fair prints of each Bill shall be duly authenticated by the proper Officers of each House, as the Bill to which both Houses have agreed.

IV. That the Royal Assent shall be endorsed in the usual form on such fair print so authenticated which shall be deposited in the Record Tower, in lieu of the present Engrossment.

V. That the Copies promulgated in the first instance by the Queen's Printer, shall be impressions from the same form as the deposited copy.

VI. That the Master of the Rolls shall, upon being duly authorised in that behalf, receive in lieu of the Copies of Public General Acts as now enrolled, the hereinbefore mentioned duplicate fair print of each Public General Bill, to be held for the same purpose, and subject to the same conditions for and upon which the Enrolled Acts are now received and held by him.

VII. That it is expedient, with a view to economy, convenience, and despatch, and to the diminutions of the chance of errors, that one Printer should print the Public General Bills for both Houses; and that inasmuch as the Queen's Printer is by virtue of his office bound to print the Acts, it would be advisable for the attainment of the before-mentioned objects, that the Queen's Printer should be employed by both Houses to print the Public General Bills.

RECORD of the Public Services of Officers of the several Colonial Governments and other persons connected with the Colonies.
PART V.

RECORD of the Public Services of Officers of the several Colonial Governments and other persons connected with the Colonies.

The titles of "His Excellency," "His Honour," which are purely local, are, to save space, not inserted in the following records of services.

Officers while actually administering the government of a Colony are styled "His Excellency."

The Lieutenant-Governor of a Province in the Dominion of Canada is styled "His Honour," and the same style is accorded to Judges of Colonial Supreme Courts.

The title of "The Honourable" is given to all members of the Queen's Privy Council for the Dominion of Canada, and of the Senate, and is by local usage adopted by members of the Executive and Legislative Councils in all Colonies. The President or Speaker of the Lower House (where two legislative chambers exist), also assume this designation. Its use is restricted to the period of actual tenure of office, but ex-members of the Executive Council in Colonies possessing responsible government may under certain conditions, by permission of the Queen, be allowed to retain the title within the Colony after having ceased to hold office. The members of the Queen's Privy Council for the Dominion of Canada, and of the Executive Councils of Victoria, Tasmania, and the Cape Colony, do not vacate their seats, and therefore retain the title for life. By a notice published in the "London Gazette" of 16th June, 1893, Her Majesty approved of the use and recognition of the title throughout Her Majesty's Dominions in the case of members of the Executive of Legislative Councils of Colonies possessing responsible government, so long as they are entitled to it, and by circular despatch of 14th November, 1896, it has been laid down that members of the Legislative Councils of responsible government Colonies, after not less than ten years' continuous service, may, on the recommendation of the Governor, be allowed to retain the title for life.

Acting appointments cannot, as a rule, be inserted in this record; nor can the services of officers be continued after their retirement unless they possess some honorary distinction. Officers are requested to furnish prompt information as to any errors or deficiencies in the record.

Owing to the increasing pressure on their space, the Editors have been compelled to abbreviate the records of service as much as possible.

PATENT DUPLEX PRESS.

SIMPLICITY, DURABILITY, CHEAPNESS, POWER.

For Stamping Notarial, Official, Corporate, and other Seals, &c.

MESSRS. HARRISON & SONS beg to call attention to the Patent Duplex Press, so little force is needed to work it, that the Press requires no fixing, and a stand is not necessary; it may be placed on an ordinary table or desk.

It is constructed without screw or springs, the power being produced by a Cam. From the extreme simplicity of its mechanism, it can be supplied at one-half the price of an ordinary screwpress.

The Patent Duplex Press can be fitted with a lock, so as to prevent its being used by an unauthorized person.

Price of Press (for Dies not exceeding $2\frac{1}{2}$ inches in diameter) ... £5 5 0

Price of Locking Apparatus and two Locks ... ... ... £1 5 0

With Copying Book complete ... ... ... ... 7 0 10 6
" " " " and with Inkstand ... ... ... ... 9 0 12 6

Directions for Use.

To copy a letter or other writing, extend the book on a table or desk, with the case toward you; place your letter under a leaf of the book with the writing uppermost; wet the cloth, squeeze it as dry as possible with one hand, and spread it over the leaf. Lay the oiled paper over the cloth to prevent wetting the preceding leaf; roll the case on the table so as to furl the book tightly round it, and in five seconds you will have a perfect copy.

When the letter to be copied covers two or more sides of the sheet, a half sheet of plain paper placed between the written sides will prevent blotting.

Good copying ink should be used.

When one book is filled, it can be slipped out of the groove, and replaced by another.

THE CHROMOGRAPH.

The Chromograph is an ingenious invention which enables any one to produce a number of copies from MSS. written with a special ink supplied with the Apparatus, and is, therefore, invaluable to those who are often requiring reproductions of their letters, invitations, despatches, circulars, plans, or drawings, fifty fac-similes of which can be produced in a few moments, without any knowledge of Printing or Lithography being required. The Apparatus consists of two flat metal boxes lined with a gelatinous composition, which answers the same purpose as the stone in Lithographic Printing, and these cases are separable and close together in the shape of a book.

The MS. to be copied is written on any kind of paper, and with any pen (either steel or quill), with the ink supplied, and the writing or drawing, being perfectly dry, is placed face downwards on the composition and the hand passed lightly over it two or three times, the paper is then pulled gently off (in the same manner as shown in the illustration above), and a fac-simile counterpart of the writing or drawing will be found transferred to the composition. A sheet of paper of any kind is then laid upon the composition and smoothed down lightly with the hand, and after two or three seconds is withdrawn in the same manner as before mentioned, and a clear and perfect copy of the original will be found printed upon it. This operation is repeated as often as required, from eight to ten minutes only being required to produce forty to fifty copies.

Immediately the requisite number of copies are printed, fill the sponge supplied with the Apparatus with clean cold water, and rub the surface gently, and the writing will be speedily effaced, as easily, in fact, as pencil writing from the surface of a porcelain slate.

If the composition is at any time accidentally scratched or broken, it can be remedied by heating it and allowing it to cool, care being taken to prevent dust from settling on it when in a liquid state.

This Apparatus has been supplied and found most useful to Merchants, Secretaries, and most of H. M.'s Ambassadors, Consuls, and Agents abroad.

Burke's General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Comprising a registry of Armorial Bearings from the earliest to the present time. This work contains above 66,000 Blazons of the Arms of Families, Companies, Cities, &c., with mottoes arranged in alphabetical order. This Work having engaged the personal attention of the Editor for a considerable period of time, will be found most valuable, not only to the Student of Heraldry and those personally interested in its pages, but to all who are brought into connection with the subject by their professions—such as Engravers, Silversmiths, Conch Builders, Die Sinkers, &c. Uniform with "The Peerage," "The Landed Gentry," &c. 1,280 pages, super royal 8vo., cloth gilt. Price £2 12s. 6d.
"The work may indisputably claim to be one great authority on all things heraldic."—Illustrated News.
"Its authority is unquestionable over the whole range of facts with which it deals; it is the most comprehensive collection ever presented to the world."—Saunders' Irish Daily News.

Burke's Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland. Ninth Edition, 1898. Thoroughly Revised. The Editor has been enabled, in diligent collaboration with the families themselves, to make this edition especially complete, accurate and interesting, not only to the landed classes but to all lovers of family history. All the well-known features of the work have been retained, and a new one added that will, it is hoped, enhance the value of the book from every point of view. To illustrate the thousands of articles, a very large number of representations in fac-simile of the Armorial Book Plates in use by the heads of families are given. Their artistic merit and heraldic interest must, it is felt, extend the wide popularity of this standard work. The Landed Gentry is a vast compendium of genealogical knowledge, for it contains the records of nearly six thousand families, with all their branches, and accurate descriptions of their heraldic insignia. It is published in two volumes, uniform with "The Peerage," "General Armory," &c., &c. Super royal 8vo., cloth gilt. Price £3 3s.
Burke's Peerage, Baronetage, Knight-

AGE, &c., for 1898. 60th Edition. This Peerage and Baronetage is the only one extant which combines, in one volume, the full genealogical or past, as well as the present, account of all the Peers and Baronets of the realm. The Baronetage, incorporated with the Peerage, is complete in every detail as to the Lineage and present condition of each Baronet and his family. The Knightage has been much enlarged by the introduction of the family connections of the Knights of the several Orders of the Knights Bachelors and of the Members of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council. Precedence.—This important subject has been fully dealt with, and the Lists may be relied on as authoritative. The Peers, Baronets, and Knights, and the Companions of the several Orders of Knighthood are placed according to their relative rank; and there is given a Scale of General or Social Precedence, and a List of the Maids of Honour to the Queen, with their relative Precedence. Tables of Precedence of Diplomatic Agents; Relative Rank of the Officers of the Navy and Army; and Precedence in the Colonies, the Dominion of Canada, and the Indian Empire are also supplied. There will also be found official Lists of The Order of the Indian Empire, The Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, The Imperial Order of the Crown of India, The Victoria Cross, The Albert Medal, and The Royal Red Cross. The heraldic department includes not only the engravings of the arms of both Peers and Baronets, but also the written blazon or descriptions. To this work is added a Key, or comprehensive Alphabetical List, by means of which every titled personage, and many others, can be easily traced. Nearly 2,000 pages, super royal 8vo., cloth gilt. Price £1 18s. (Published annually.)

"Has for more than half-a-century been regarded as containing a history of all the great titled families in the Empire. There is scarcely a page in the volume that is not full of interest. . . . There is an excellent index to the work. . . . Considerable space is devoted to the question of precedence."—Times.

Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne

Is the Great Specific for
CHOLERA, DYSENTERY, DIARRHŒA,
COUGHS,
Colds, ASTHMA, BRONCHITIS.

Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne.—Dr. J. C. Browne (late Army Medical Staff) discovered a remedy to denote which he coined the word Chlorodyne. Dr. Browne is the sole inventor, and, as the composition of Chlorodyne cannot possibly be discovered by Analysis (organic substances defying elimination), and since the formula has never been published, it is evident that any statement to the effect that a compound is identical with Dr. Browne's Chlorodyne must be false.

This Caution is necessary, as many persons deceive purchasers by false representations.

Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne.—Vice-Chancellor Sir W. Page Wood stated publicly in Court that Dr. J. Collis Browne was undoubtedly the inventor of Chlorodyne, that the whole story of the defendant Freeman was deliberately untrue, and he regretted to say it had been sworn to.—See The Times, July 13, 1864.

General Board of Health, London, report that it acts as a charm, one dose generally sufficient.

Dr. Gibbon, Army Medical Staff, Calcutta, states, "two doses completely cured me of diarrhoea."

Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne is the true palliative in neuralgia, gout, cancer, toothache, rheumatism.

Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne is a liquid medicine which assuages pain of every kind, affords a calm, refreshing sleep without headache, and invigorates the nervous system when exhausted.

Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne rapidly cuts short all attacks of epilepsy, spasms, colic, palpitation, hysteria.
