FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Montevideo. They consist of the East Falkland (area 3,900 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54½° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Roche in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited, and almost perpetually ice-bound. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles (equal to Wales).

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1763 they were taken possession of by France, and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1764. In the following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison, which was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774, and no further formal occupation made till in 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis ("or 'Anson") until 1844, when it was moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 800. The houses are mostly of wood and iron, built as they are required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house, but there are several small hotels affording comfortable accommodation. The general aspect of the town is scarcely in keeping with the substantial prosperity of the inhabitants. Stanley is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1896, five vessels of a total tonnage of 236 tons. It has a fine inner and outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels
going round Cape Horn. There are two Government schools with 120 pupils, a Roman Catholic school with 53, and a Baptist school with 40. The attendance averages two-thirds of the number on the rolls. At Darwin, on the East Falkland, there is a small hamlet where the Falkland Islands Company have a school with about a score of pupils, as well as a travelling schoolmaster with some 28 scholars. Fox Bay on the West Falkland, is the residence of the Stipendiary Magistrate, and two Government travelling schoolmasters are engaged in instructing the young in the most remote shepherd's houses in that Island.

The climate is severe but healthy, except for those predisposed to pulmonary affections. It is uniformly cold, the mean temperature being 42°. The thermometer ranges between 30° and 50° in winter, and between 40° and 65° in summer. The cold is intensified by constant high winds which prevail, especially in the summer, rising about 10 a.m., and falling away between 4 and 5 p.m. There is an abundance of mist and rain, the annual rainfall being 28.80 inches; in the summer however, the atmosphere is remarkably dry and evaporation is rapid.

The entire country is wild moorland interspersed with rocks and stone runs. Stone of two or three kinds, suitable for building, is found in different parts of the island. The soil is chiefly soft peat, and travelling is difficult. There are no roads except within the limits of Stanley, and communication is by sea or on horseback. The islands are so well adapted for sheep-farming, that the entire acreage has been devoted to that industry. The tussock, which grows to the height of seven feet, and affords fattening food for cattle, has now disappeared from the East and West Falklands, but it still abounds on the smaller islands. Celery, scurvy grass and sorrel are very plentiful, besides a small plant called the tea plant, much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos. In November and December the ground is covered with a great variety of sweet-scented flowers. The cultivation of fruit and vegetables is made difficult by the damp, cold nature of the soil and the prevalence of high winds. Trees are completely absent.

Mutton is bought for 2d., beef for 5d. per lb., fowls 3s. each, eggs, when procurable, for 2½d. Fresh milk is bought for between 4d. and 6d. a pint in summer, but cannot be obtained in winter. Apples and oranges of an inferior sort imported from Chili and Uruguay fetch 2d. each.

The sole industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Patagonia. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were, in 1896—3,031 horses, 6,500 cattle, 761,768 sheep.

The chief export is wool. The other exports consist of frozen mutton, sheep skins, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general supplies, and ship's stores.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government savings bank of the usual type was established, in which on 30th September, 1896, the deposits were 36,718l., belonging to 308 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 97,128 acres purchased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a very flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is 110,000l., all paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by Mr. A. E. Baillon, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin, and provides a salary for a clergyman of the Church of England.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England every 21 days. The German "Kosmos" Steamship Company steamers call at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao and on the return voyage, once every three weeks. The voyage between Stanley and London occupies four weeks. Mails for the Falkland Islands are also carried by the Pacific Company's Steamers, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos Steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to the United Kingdom 2½d. per ½ oz.; to the rest of Europe and foreign countries 4d. per ½ oz.; there is an internal postal rate 1½d. the ½ oz. Parcel postage to London, 9d. per lb

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Monte Video. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of 600l.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Judge, the Colonial Secretary, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet for five years.

**FIJI.**

**Situation and Area.**
The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° S. and 22° S., and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs, between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Tavuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).
Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior, 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" ("Calocasia esculenta").

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the "Pandora" in 1783, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty." Lying to the north-west, from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofina, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1891 to number 2,219, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra, of which about 300 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are two native stipendiary magistrates who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor, rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotumah Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner, the chiefs, and magistrates). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1881 and 1891 respectively, with the estimated population at the end of 1896, is shown in the following table:

| Estimated 1896 | Males | Females | Total |
|---------------|-------|---------|-------|
|               |       |         |       |

Net decrease during the decade...
The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1881 was somewhat incorrect in so much as there was then a tendency on the part of the natives to exaggerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the census of 1891 came to be made, that tendency had taken a turn in the opposite direction, under the impression that the assessment of taxes would follow the result of the enumeration. The birth and death returns furnished during the ten years, and believed to be fairly accurate, indicate a decrease of about 4,500 in the native Fijian population. The births among the native population in 1896 were 3,531, and the deaths 4,526. The birth rate was 35·26, and the death rate 45·11 per mil. The death rate among native children is excessive.

Indian immigration has almost taken the place of Polynesian immigration, hence the respective increase and decrease in the population of Indians and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian labourers are both cheaper and more suitable than Polynesians for work on sugar plantations. The Indian immigrant population is now about 10,000.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions give the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1896:

| Wesleyan | ... | ... | ... | 96,421 |
| Roman Catholic Mission | ... | ... | ... | 9,437 |

**History.**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the "Bounty," sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the Island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Mafu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

**Climate.**

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1896 was 94° in April, and the lowest 60° in July. The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva, 79·67 inches, but the rainfall ordinarily exceeds 100 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is the driest period. Between December and April is the hurricane season.

**Constitution.**

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd Jan., 1875. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and four official members, and when sitting for the re-hearing of claims of land, under Ordinance No. 25 of 1879, consists of the ordinary members, with the Chief Justice, the Commissioner for Lands, and Mr. W. S. Carew.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and six official and six non-official nominated members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the Island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and suburbs numbered 834 at the census of 1891. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had on 31st December, 1896, 10 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 519 tons. During the year 1896 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 191 vessels, of a total tonnage of 1,834; of these 66 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 793), and 125 by natives (tonnage 1,041).

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000l. to 19,000l. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce. The produce contributed consists of sugar-cane, copra, tobacco, yengona (*Macropiper methysticum*), cotton, maize, beeche-de-mer, and occasionally green fruit and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar mills under contracts which are generally entered into for a term of years. Copra (the principal item in which native taxes are paid) and cotton are sold by public tender annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed price per ton for all that is received.

Tobacco, maize, and other products are sold by tender or by public auction as the quantity from
time to time contributed, and the state of the market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money. The amount thus returned in 1896 was £8,560.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of ratable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

A grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1896 were: Suva town board, £1,680; and £1,505; ditto school board, £718; and £678.; Levuka town board, £1,238; and £1,129; ditto school board, £552; and £566.

Total receipts of local authorities, £4,189; total expenditure, £3,880; in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council, and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva with 96 scholars, and one in Levuka with 87 scholars on the roll.

There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka (attendance 48), and one in Suva, with an attendance of 97.

There is a Government technical school on the island of Vitilevu, within ten miles of Suva, where 78 native youths are instructed in primary education, planting, boat building, and other industrial pursuits. The school is partly self-supporting.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 2,064 schools, with 2,597 native teachers, and 35,141 scholars.

The latter have 141 schools, with 2,009 scholars.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New Zealand has two branches in Fiji—at Suva and Levuka.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz. (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. Since that date the cultivation of kidney cotton has revived, and gives some indications of expansion. In the meantime the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney. This trade increased year by year, until it ranked as the export second only in importance to that of sugar.

The quantity of fruit exported during the year 1892 was 788,100 bunches of bananas, 5,555 cases, and 3 packages (pineapples for the most part), and 55 cwt. of dried fruit, which, valued at 1s. 6d. per bunch and 12s. per package on an average, amounts to £2,564., but owing to the competition of Queensland and the maintenance of high rates of freight from Fiji the export fell, in 1893, to 348,599 bunches, and 17,421 cases of fruit, valued at £36,597. In 1894 a slight increase was experienced, the export having amounted to 390,746 bunches and 33,014 cases of fruit, valued at £49,114. In 1895 the export was only 114,024 bunches of fruit, 20,725 cases of fruit, valued at £20,986 16s. 0d.

This falling off has been due to disease locally, and to competition combined with the results of general depression in the Australian and New Zealand fruit markets. The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, grenadillas, and perhaps mangoes and guavas, which might well be extended.

The following table will illustrate the expansion of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar | Fruit | Copra |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
| 1875 | 90 | £3,417 | 97 | £3,871 | 40,058 |
| 1880 | 593 | 20,920 | 5,216 | 7,339 | 109,758 |
| 1890 | 15,291 | 244,655 | 57,563 | 4,657 | 42,901 |

| 1596 | 27,334 | 336,929 | 18,488 | 5,457 | 48,950 |
The other principal exports in 1896 consisted of:—Peanuts, 192 tons, valued at £3,649; cotton 35 tons, valued at £1,632; cocoanuts, 7,181 sacks, valued at £1,803; tobacco, 17 tons, valued at £3,798. Minor exports consist of arrowroot, bark, ginger, tortoise shell, gum, angora hair, hides, mats, pearl shell, plants and seeds sandalwood, tea, tobacco, turtles, yams, cocoanuts, wool, and bêche-de-mer.

The cultivation of a superior class of tobacco, specially adapted for use as cigar wrappers, is being entered on by Europeans. The growth of rice has also been commenced, and notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the markets the cultivation of sugar cane is being extended.

About 90 per cent. of the trade of the Colony is with the Australian colonies and New Zealand. There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and all trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through those colonies.

Means of Communication.

The number of letters, newspapers, and book packets received and despatched by the Post Office during the year 1895 is given in the following statement:

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the colony: Sydney, (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Auckland (4 days), fortnightly, in connection with the San Francisco Mail Service. Many extra steamers run during the sugar season. Since the end of 1893, Suva has been a port of call of the Canadian-Australian line of steamers running between Sydney and Vancouver. The Colony joins the other Australian Colonies in subsidising the mail service by the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient lines of mail steamers.

Postage to the United Kingdom, via Vancouver or via Brindisi, 2½d. per ½ oz.; via San Francisco, 4d.; to the Australian Colonies and New Zealand, 2d. per ½ oz. Internal postal rates: town 1d., country 2d. per ½ oz.; newspapers 1d. A Parcel Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is one shilling for the first 1 lb., and eightpence per lb. thereafter.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco and via Vancouver in about thirty-five days.

There is no railway or telegraph in the colony. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Auckland (N.Z.) and Sydney, (N.S.W.). Intercommunication within the group is maintained by sailing boats and steam launches, and by an inter-insular steamer. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands.
