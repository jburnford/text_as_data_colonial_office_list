TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° of W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 48 miles, and its average breadth 35 miles, and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony now includes Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 and 51 Vic., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the king of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the Island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640, it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690, by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Romo de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere, by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercrombie, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The estimated population of the colony at the end of 1896 was 248,404, and is chiefly composed of English, Germans, French, Spanish, and a large proportion of East Indians, estimated at 81,404. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; and only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour at Chaguaramas. The whole gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There
are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1896 were: Sugar, 120,562,942 lbs.; and cocoa, 23,481,848 lbs. Tobacco of a superior quality is also grown. Molasses, rum, bitters, coconuts, and asphaltite, are also exported.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about a million sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the last 5 years, 1891 to 1896, was 72-92 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1896 was 79-07 Fahr., the maximum being 91-1 in May, and the minimum 66-7 in February, and the rainfall 60-45 inches.

The island is divided into eight counties as shown on the map.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population in 1891, 33,273), situated on a gently inclined plain, near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1896, 236 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 6,485. Seven miles of tramway and 450 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1891, 6,570), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

Both these towns possess elective municipal councils and mayors. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain. Population in 1891, 3,653. The total municipal revenue of the three boroughs in 1896 was £30,100, the expenditure £33,143, and the debt, Boro' of San Fernando excepted, was £8,003, on 31st December, 1896.

A pitch lake, 109 to 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value, and has been leased to an American Company, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of 10,000l., and a royalty on the out-put in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease is for 21 years from 1st January, 1888; a further extension may be granted for another 21 years.

The revenue derived from the Pitch Lake in 1896 was £25,370l. 6s. 4d.

Of the total area of Trinidad which is estimated at about 1,120,000 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of 1896 was estimated to be approximately 438,234 acres. About 200,000 acres are under cultivation, 631,766 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers, which ply three times a week, and by the railway. The Gulf steamers proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 43 miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles), on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Princes Town in 1884, and further extensions which will open up communication with the interior of the island and the east coast are in course of construction. The extension (12 miles) to Sangre Grande, eastward, or as opened on 25th August, 1897, and the extension through the Caharo Valley (South-east) will be opened in December, 1897. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande. The total length of line open is about 71 miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total receipts from the railways during 1896 were £67,768l., and the expenditure was £40,938l. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund, which in 1895 amounted to £26,500l.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and about 53 out offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada, and Saint Croix, and thence, via the United States, with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 168 miles, constructed by the Government. The receipts in 1896 were £637l., and the expenses £403l.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 34 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides some few transient steamers:—Harrison Line, West Indian and Pacific, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Dutch Line, London Direct Line, Oriental, Canadian, Quebec and Gulf Line, Oriental and Cuidad Bolivar, Orinoco Line, New York and Bermudez, Messrs. Turnbull, Stewart, and Co.'s fruit subsidy steamers, The Royal Mail. It is worthy of note that the steamers of Compagnie Generale Transatlantique are as a rule of greater tonnage than the ocean boats of the Royal Mail, and find no difficulty in entering the port. The communication with the neighbouring Republic of Venezuela averages for the year over 16 steamers per month. A fortnightly service to New York has been started by a local firm. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers. The rates of postage are as follows per ½ oz. letter:—

Within Colony ... ... ... 1
To any country beyond sea ... 2½

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £51,974l. was expended by the Government in 1896, in introducing 2,193 (Statute adults) immigrants. The numbers introduced in 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896, respectively were 2,915, 3,750, 1,949, 2,519, 2,193, and 3,087.

The amount remitted to India during 1896 by return Indian immigrants was £9,685 4 0

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, United States gold currency, and gold doubloons. These are all legal tender, as is also British gold, which is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of 105,000l. estimated.
There is no Colonial coinage or note issue.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank has a branch at Port of Spain. Government savings banks are established in nine districts. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1896 was £29,753. They are under the management of the Receiver-General and the local wardens.

Defence.

A volunteer rifle corps was established in Port of Spain in 1879, and detached companies at San Fernando, Arima, Princes Town and Couva. A yeomanry corps has also been established with troops in large centres, and a volunteer artillery corps at Port of Spain. Total strength 740.

The police force consists of 517 officers and men.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, St. Mary's College. Attached to these institutions are four exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of £50 each, tenable for three years at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of 1896—89 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and 180 on those of St. Mary's College.

The primary schools are now 189 in number, 60 of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and 129 denominational and assisted. Fees are exacted, the rate being twopence per head per week, and at the Model Schools and two assisted schools five shillings per month.

In connection with the Model Schools there are Training Colleges for male and female teachers, which admit twelve resident and seven non-resident students. The Government schools in 1896 had 6,783 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 15,697.

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private adventure schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for girls. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad is shown to be 23,562.

Government.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of seven members. The legislative body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 9 official, and 11 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.
