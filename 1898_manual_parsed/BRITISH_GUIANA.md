BRITISH GUIANA.

Situation and Area.

This Colony is a portion of the South American Continent, extending from east to west about 560 miles, and from north to south about 550 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, and is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyn, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and northeast by the Atlantic Ocean. Its area is about 109,000 square miles, about the size of the United Kingdom, extending from 5° to 1° north latitude, and from 57° to 62° west longitude. About 130 square miles only are under cultivation.

The western boundary is still in dispute with Venezuela. The Dutch, while British Guiana was in their possession, claimed the whole watershed of the Essequibo river, while the Venezuelans assert that the Spanish province of Guayana extended up to the Essequibo. Various attempts have been made to settle the question by negotiation, but without result; and in 1886 Her Majesty's Government, without prejudice to their claim to the whole territory held by their Dutch predecessors in title, declared definitely that they would not allow any advance on the part of Venezuela beyond the boundary shown on the accompanying map. This boundary is the one recommended by Sir R. Schomburgk, who surveyed it in 1842-43, as a good natural boundary, well within the limits which Great Britain might have rightfully claimed. Shortly after this, in 1887, Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Great Britain, but these have been resumed since 1897.

During 1895 a Venezuelan force crossed this line and seized a small detachment of British Guiana police, stationed at Ururan on the upper reaches of the Cuyuni river, and assaulted Mr. Francis, a British subject. The police were released soon after, and an apology has been rendered by Venezuela, and compensation has been paid to the officers and men of the police and to Mr. Francis.

In June, 1896, a party of workmen, under Mr. W. A. Harrison, Government Surveyor, were interrupted by armed Venezuelan soldiers whilst at work on a survey of a government line for a road to the left bank of the Acarabisi river, a tributary of the Cuyuni, and well within the Schomburgk line, of which the Acarabisi forms part. Mr. Harrison was taken by the Venezuelans and conveyed by boat up the Cuyuni to the Eldorado station opposite the British outpost at the Ururan. He was, on the representations of the police officer in charge, eventually released, and was conveyed to Georgetown suffering from a severe attack of malarial fever. The survey of the line was continued and has since been completed by Colonial officials, under the supervision of the Government agent of the district. The matter is now under the consideration of Her Majesty's Government. Arbitration on the territory in dispute has been agreed upon by the British and Venezuelan governments, and it is anticipated that the tribunal will commence its sittings early in the year 1898.

History and Constitution.

The territory was first partially settled by the Dutch West India Company in 1589 by planting a depot on the River Pomeroon in the present county of Essequebe. In 1624 a settlement was founded on the Berbice by Van Peere, a Flushing merchant, under license from the Company. The first English attempt at settlement was made by Captain Leigh on the Ozapock river in 1604. The effort, though followed up by Robert Harcourt in 1613 and 1627, failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, also turned his attention to Guiana, and founded a settlement on the Surinam in 1663, which was captured by the Dutch in 1667, and ceded to them at the peace of
Breda in exchange for New York. The Dutch retained their hold on the three colonies with more or less firmness, now yielding to England, now to France or Portugal, till 1796, when during the war of the French Revolution they were captured by a British Fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, and finally ceded to that power in 1814.

Under the Dutch, Demerara and Essequebo constituted one Government, and Berbice another an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1732; under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Demerara appears to have been established in 1773. In 1789 that for Essequebo was merged in it, and the seat of Government for the United provinces established at Stabroek, the site of the present capital Georgetown. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government, and the West India Company, as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1788, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution), was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government, established a new one for the conjoined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation, notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and in 1802, and its cession in 1803, the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before.

The Council or Court of Policy consisted of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequebo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequebo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequebo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each Colony, each consisting of seven Members, elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the Office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin d'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned, or ceased to be an inhabitant.

In 1795 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds. In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon annulled this arrangement, and to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation enacted that in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proclamation remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when the three provinces were united, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

With an exception in regard to the franchise, to be noticed hereafter, this has been the usage and procedure till now, from which the inference has been drawn that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.

The colonial members have never acquiesced in this interpretation of the constitution, and there have been frequent collisions between the Executive and Elective sections of the Court. The position they assume is based upon the construction of a passage in a decree of the States-General, dated 27th August, 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves;" and a passage in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1793, "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a great number of the Colonists, for example the Kiezers of both rivers." The nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806 has also been held to support this contention.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Philip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty; and from that date till 1891 the only constitutional legislation was the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist" as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution, as it existed up to 1891, may be summed up very briefly. It consisted of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly were performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which were, and still are dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passes all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which is passed by the Combined Court.

During the discussions on the Civil List in 1818-9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governor the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.

Proceedings relative to the Functions of the Financial Representative, 1832.
During 1891 an Act was passed, which came into force in 1892, effecting a considerable change in the constitution. By this Act the administrative functions of the Court of Policy have been transferred to an executive council, and the duties of the former become purely legislative.

The Combined Court has the power of (1) imposing the Colonial taxes and auditing the public accounts; and (2) discussing freely and without reserve the items on the annual estimates prepared by the Governor, in Executive Council. The first of these powers is the birthright of the Combined Court, having been bestowed in 1796, when Governor Beaujon called the financial representatives into being, "with a right of voting only for the raising of colonial taxes and not further;" while the second is conferred periodically by Her Majesty's Order in Council after each renewal of the Civil List and is co-existent with the Civil List.

The Court of Policy, under the new constitution, consists of the governor, seven official members, and eight elected members. It may be prorogued or dissolved at any time by the Governor and in any case is dissolved at the end of five years, and a general election must be held within two months of the date of dissolution. The number of financial representatives, who with the Court of Policy form the Combined Court, remains unchanged.

The qualification for membership of the Court of Policy, which hitherto was restricted to ownership of 80 acres of land, 40 of which had to be under cultivation, is extended to ownership of immovable property of the value of not less than £1,500, or of a house, or house and land, of the annual rental value of £250.

The qualification for election as a financial representative is the same as for membership of the Court of Policy, with the further qualification of clear annual income of £300, arising from any kind of property not mentioned in any other property qualification, or from any profession, business, or trade carried on in the colony.

The College of Electors, which elected members of the Court of Policy, has been abolished, and members are now elected by the direct vote of the people.

The franchise in the case of county voters is extended to every person who during the six months previous to registration has had—

(1.) Ownership of not less than three acres of land actually under cultivation; or of a house, or a house and land, of the annual rental or value of not less than £20; or (2.) occupation or tenancy of not less than six acres of land under cultivation; or of a house, or of a house and land, of the annual rental or value of not less than £40; or

(3.) An annual income or salary of not less than £100, coupled with residence in the district or division; or

(4.) Has paid during the twelve months previous to registration direct taxes to the Colonial revenue of £1, 3s. 4d. or upwards, coupled with residence in the district or division during the six months previous to registration.

In the case of city voters the franchise extends to every person who has had during the six months previous to registration:

(1.) Ownership of a house, or of a house and premises, or the value of not less than £104, 3s. 4d.; or—

(2.) Occupation or tenancy, of a house, or of a house and premises, of the annual rental or value of not less than £25; or—

(3.) An annual income or salary of not less than £100, coupled with residence in the district; or—

(4.) Has paid during the twelve months previous to registration, direct taxes to the colonial revenue of £1, 3s. 4d. or upwards, coupled with residence in the district during the six months previous to registration.

Aliens who previously acquired the political rights of citizenship after three years' residence, are now debarred from such rights while they remain aliens.

The number of registered electors is 2,756.

There is a Public Officers Guarantee Fund, and also a Widows and Orphans' Fund, towards the latter of which all officers with salaries over £100 contribute 4 per cent. of their salaries.

Pensions are granted to public officers under Law No. 12 of 1875 after reaching the age of 55 or on medical certificate of physical or mental incapacity, provided the officer has served for 10 years. An officer transferred from another Colony is not entitled to pension unless he has served at least 5 years in British Guiana. Pensions are calculated at the rate 1/3th of the officer's average emoluments for three years preceding his retirement, the maximum allowed being £1,000. Special pensions are granted to the Judges; but all appointments made since the 31st of March 1897, will be subject to modifications as to the pensions which are now under consideration.

Local Government.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated, but the principle has not been materially extended in its application.

The existing municipal authorities are: mayor and town council, Georgetown; and mayor and town council, New Amsterdam. Their revenue in 1895 was respectively £1,226, —£10,271, and their expenditure £1,057, —£9,212. There are also 18 villages incorporated, whose revenue and expenditure in 1895 were respectively £6,500, and £6,304. The total village debt was £16,672.

The Roman Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by Orders in Council and local Ordinances; the Criminal Law is now based on that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that there is no Grand Jury.

Internal Communications.

The three rivers, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, are navigable for 90, 35, and 150 miles respectively. Beyond these distances, owing to the nature of the country, they abound in cataracts and waterfalls. There is a good network of roads, and there are small canals in connection with the Demerara River. There is a railway from Georgetown to Mahaica, about 20 miles in length, owned by the Demerara Railway Company, Limited. Its receipts in 1896 were £36,712, its expenses £25,488. The line was constructed at a total cost of £280,000. The Company are extending the line to New Amsterdam under a Government guarantee of 4½% for 50 years, and a railway connecting the Upper Demerara and Upper Essequibo Rivers leading to the interior, and affording access to the gold diggings, has been open since the beginning of 1897; whilst the Demerara railway company are constructing a line on the West Coast connecting Vergenoegen with Philadelphia. The postal telegraph system comprises about 1,072 miles of line, with 17 cables covering a distance of 84 miles. It is in connection with a cable to Trinidad, and thus with Europe and the United States. The revenue from
the postal telegraph and telephone services in 1896-7 was £4,471l., and the expenditure for maintenance £73l. A telephone exchange (514 subscribers) is established at Georgetown and at New Amsterdam in connection with the postal telegraph; length of telephone lines 610 miles, longest line 15 miles. Local steamers run under contract from Georgetown to New Amsterdam, to the Essequibo coast, to Bartica, and to Mount Everard on the Barima River, 46 miles from its mouth. Steamers also ply up the Berbice and Demerara Rivers. Launches of light draught can, during a portion of the year, proceed up the Barima River to Arakaka, the centre of the mining industry in the North-western District. Roads have been also opened by the Government between the Barima and Barana rivers, for about 26 miles into the interior from Carbulo point on the Massarimon, between the Polaro and Conacoarook rivers, and from Kalacoma towards the Calceri creek between the Essequibo and Massarimon. A well organised postal service extends throughout the colony, letters reaching Pomeroon in 24 hours from Georgetown, and the North-west District in 36 hours.

Education.

A state aided system of elementary education was established by Law No. 3 of 1876. The schools are denominational, except the Estates schools. The central administration is vested in the Inspector of Schools, and the local control conducted by managers, who are usually ministers of religion.

The number of schools receiving aid in 1896-7 was 207, with 28,268 scholars, and the aid granted amounted to £20,893l.

Provision is made for higher education by a Government college in Georgetown, in which the course of instruction is similar to that of a public school or first grade grammar school in England, and there is awarded annually one public scholarship of the value of £200 per annum, tenable at a University in England for three years; or in the event of the scholar selecting the medical profession, the scholarship is tenable for five years at £150l. per annum. Scholarships, entitling the holders to free education at the Government College or at other approved schools, are granted to scholars of the Primary Schools.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. British sterling and United States gold coin is current and legal tender, as well as Spanish and Mexican gold. Spanish, Mexican, or Columbian dollars are no longer legal tender, under Ordinance No. 1 of 1876. There are also remaining some old silver tokens from one-eighth to three guilders (one guilder being equal to one shilling and fourpence).

The "Colonial" and "British Guiana" Banks have establishments at Georgetown, with branches at New Amsterdam. The British Guiana Bank on the 31st March, 1897, had a note circulation of £48,701l., and the Colonial Bank £2,203l. The total note circulation in the Colony is about £100,000l.

The first Government savings banks were established at Georgetown and New Amsterdam in the year 1836. A branch bank was opened at Suddie, Essequibo, in 1879, at Belfield on the East Coast, Demerara, in 1884, and another at Fellowship on the West Coast, Demerara, in 1887. The total deposits amounted on 31st December, 1896, to £264,873l., among 20,305 depositors. There are 22 Post Office Savings Banks. At the end of that year these banks had 7,290 depositors, with £30,373l. to their credit.

Industry and Productions.

The staple products of British Guiana were in former years sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, and coffee. The soil of some parts of the Colony is capable of producing coffee of rare excellence, the Berbice River coffee being once much prized. The latter two industries have now given place to the cultivation of the sugar-cane, which at present is the chief industry of the Colony, closely followed however by the rising gold industry, and furnishes eighty-two per cent. in value of its exports. Timber, charcoal, and balata, a species of gum, are also exported. The total area of sugar plantations is 156,099 acres, of which 67,458 are under sugar, 3,354 under plantains, and the remainder uncultivated.

The forests, with which the interior of the colony is covered, abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of household furniture.

There are 63 sugar estates in active operation having an aggregate of sugar cane cultivation of 67,458 acres, and of plantain cultivation of 3,354 acres. During 1896-7, 107,073 tons of sugar, 3,291,190 gallons rum, and 913,150 gallons molasses were exported. The bulk of the production is the high class sugar known as Demerara crystals.

Further attention is being given to the planting of coffee and cocoa on the vegetable soils to the rear of the cane grove;* and several abandoned coffee estates are being reclaimed. Rice is now grown to a considerable extent on the Coolie Settlements and by Free Coolies on the Savannah lands behind the Sugar Estates. The development of the minor industries is receiving considerable attention, and a company to promote rice growing on an extended scale has been formed, and has erected a mill in Georgetown which is in full working.

Gold washing is carried on by about 8,000 diggers, and is rapidly increasing, 14,570 ozs. having been exported in 1888, valued at £55,561l., while in 1891, 101,298 ozs., valued at £375,289l., were exported; in 1892, 133,147 ozs., valued at £194,551l., in 1893, 137,629 ozs., valued at £510,710l., in 1894-95, 134,047 ozs., valued at £496,899l.; in 1895-6, 122,057 ozs., valued at £444,990l.; and in 1896-97, 126,107 ozs., valued at £466,143l. The royalty received amounted to £23,982l. Several quartz crushing mills have been erected, and others are in course of erection.

The values of the principal exports besides sugar and gold are:—Timber, £20,960l.; gums, £20,661l.; including balata; shingles, £1,015l.; chocolate, £250l.; and coffee, £293l.

The chief imports are rice, beef, pork, cornmeal, flour, machinery, dried fish, and manure.

Half the trade is with the United Kingdom, and a third with the United States; the other important countries being India, Canada, and the West Indies.

*The cocoa estates are chiefly on Canal No. 1, West Bank of the Demerara River, and cocoa is grown on a small scale on some sugar estates back of the cane cultivation. Coffee was grown principally in the country of Berbice, and the Liberian coffee bean was in past years planted with great success also on some estates on Canal No. 1. Its production has fallen to below the local demands.
Climate.

The climate is hot, but not unhealthy. The mean temperature throughout the year is about 82° F., the mean maximum being 88° in the month of September, and the mean minimum 74° in the month of January. The heat, which is greatly tempered by cooling breezes from the sea prevailing during the greater portion of the year, is felt more from July to October than at other times, owing to the partial cessation of these breezes. There are annually two wet seasons, from June to the end of August and during December, January and February. The annual rainfall is about 82 inches in Georgetown. The rainfall in 1890 was 122 inches; in 1892, 117-42 inches; in 1893-4, 114 inches; in 1894-5, 87 inches; in 1895-6, 67-87 inches, and in 1896-7, 82-56 inches.

Towns.

The capital is Georgetown, situated in lat. 6° 49' 24" N., and long. 58° 11' 30" W., and possessing a population of 53,176 in 1891. New Amsterdam had a population of 8,903 in 1891. Both these are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1896, 136 vessels, of a total tonnage of 6,746.

Means of Communication.

The regular mail communication with the Colony is maintained by the vessels of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which leave Southampton every alternate Thursday, those of the Cie. Générale Transatlantique, from France and the West Indies, and the Dutch line from Holland and Havre, both monthly; and those of the Atlantic and West India line from New York every six weeks. There are other lines of steamers trading to the Colony which carry mails, but their periods of departure are uncertain. The length of the voyage between Georgetown and England is 134 days.
