TRINIDAD,

An island lying to the eastward of Venezuela, between N. latitude 10° 3' and 10° 50' W. longitude 61° and 62° 4' of Greenwich. Its length is 65 miles on the southern and 53 miles on the northern side of the island, and its breadth, on the eastern and western sides respectively, 48 and 49 miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco.

History.

It was first discovered by Christopher Columbus, on the 31st July, 1498; and first colonized in 1588 by the Spaniards. In 1676 the French gained possession of it, but it was soon restored to Spain.

On the 12th February, 1797, a British expedition for the reduction of Trinidad sailed from Martinique, on the 14th it put into Carriacou, and sailed on the following morning with some additional transports. The naval command of this Expedition was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey. The troops, numbering 6,750 men, were commanded by Sir Ralph Abercrombie.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's arms, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation being signed by Abercrombie, Harvey, and Chacon.

Abercrombie, after making the best arrangements that the confused state of the Colony allowed, departed two months after, leaving his Aide-de-Camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton, as Governor, whose first act was to institute a Council of Advice, consisting of five members.

On the 29th March, 1802, the definitive treaty of peace between England and France, and her allies, viz., Spain and the Batavian Republic, was signed at Amiens. By the third article, all places taken during the war by Great Britain, were restored, save Trinidad and Ceylon.

Area and General Description.

The area of the island is 1,754 square miles.

Port of Spain, the chief town and port of entry, according to the census of 1874, contains 23,561 inhabitants, of whom 11,065 are males, and 12,496 females.

The second town and port of entry is San Fernando, 26 miles south from Port of Spain, with a population of 5,006 inhabitants. There are also the minor inland towns of St. John, St. Joseph, Aronca, and Arima.

The harbour is the finest in the West Indies.

The principal articles of produce exported are sugar, rum, molasses, cacao, coffee, cocoa-nuts, and pitch. The number of sugar estates does not exceed 150, and those of cacao and coffee 800.

The total extent of land under cultivation, according to the assessment made in 1874, was 91,645 acres, as follows: canes, 49,877 acres; cacao and coffee, 17,828 acres; ground provisions, 17,393 acres; cocoa-nuts, 2,064 acres; pasture, 6,547 acres.

The soil of the island is rich, and produces, in addition to the cane, cacao, coffee, and cotton, numerous kinds of timber, and the choicest of West Indian fruits.

The population of the island in 1871 amounted to 109,638; 60,405 males, and 49,233 females. The total increase of population since the last census in 1861 was 28,200, or 30 per cent.

A pitch lake, 90 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, about 30 miles from Port of Spain: it is of considerable value, and affords a slight revenue to the island.

Institutions and Government.

The towns of Port of Spain and San Fernando are under the jurisdiction of Borough Councils, the former consisting of fifteen elective members, the latter of seven. One of the members is annually chosen mayor.

There is an Island Post Office, amalgamated with the General Post Office. The money-order,
system has been established between the United Kingdom and the Island, and orders can be obtained at the head post-office in Port of Spain, and also at San Fernando. There are 22 post-offices throughout the island; the total annual delivery of letters being about 219,150 packet letters, and 192,900 inland ones. There are two local steam-boats for the conveyance of mails, police, and prisoners, with a subsidy from the Colonial Government of about 3,600l. per annum. The net revenue of the postal department in 1876 was 14,330l., and the expenditure amounted to 19,926l.

Several institutions are kept up at the public expense, viz., two general hospitals, a lunatic asylum, a leper asylum, a wash-house, a public bath-house, and a house of refuge.

Immigration from India is fully encouraged by the Government. The amount expended in immigration in 1877 was 46,775l. The census of 1861 showed a total of 13,488 Indian Coolies, and 416 Chinese. The introduction of Chinese is at present wholly discontinued, but that of Indian Coolies has been continuous. By the census of 1871 there were 27,425 Coolies and 1,400 Chinese in the island.

The places of worship in Port of Spain, are an Anglican cathedral (Trinity Church), and All Saints' Chapel, a Roman Catholic Cathedral, and four Roman Catholic Chapels, a Wesleyan Chapel, a Presbyterian, a Baptist, and a Portuguese Chapel.

The military barracks, St. James's, are buildings which do credit to Trinidad, spacious, and with every requisite accommodation. They were commenced in 1824, and completed in 1827, at the expense of 80,000l.

The Police Force of the island consists of an inspector-commandant, 2 inspectors, 2 sergeant-majors, 1 quarter-master-sergeant, 22 sergeants, 20 corporals, and 224 constables, distributed at 23 stations, exclusive of the head quarters in Port of Spain. The total cost of the establishment is 22,080l. The police barracks, Port of Spain, were completed in 1876, at a cost of 71,233l.

The entire scheme of education was revised in 1870. Under the Education Ordinance of that year a college called the Queen's Royal College has been established, in connection with which is the College of the Immaculate Conception. The total number of students in these two divisions of the Royal College is 190. Four Exhibitions of 150l. each, tenable for three years at any University in Great Britain or Ireland, are annually open to competition among the students. Free admissions to the College are granted to six pupils of Primary Schools, after competitive examination. The number of primary schools under inspection is 82, and the number of scholars enrolled 7,292. The expenditure on education in 1877 was 13,000l.

The Government is administered by a Governor and an Executive Council of 3 members. The Legislative Body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 6 official and 8 unofficial members, all of whom are nominated by the Crown.

Governors of the Colony during the Spanish Government and since the Island has appertained to Great Britain.
