SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Geographical Position.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 300,000 square miles. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vic. c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude.

All the country north of the 26th parallel of south latitude, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, has also been annexed to South Australia, and is known as the Northern Territory. The present northern boundary is the Indian Ocean, latitude 11° S.; the southern boundary, the Southern Ocean, in latitude 38° S. The Province of South Australia covers twenty-seven degrees of latitude, and twelve degrees of longitude, forming, at present, the largest British Colony — the area extending over more than 900,000 square miles.

The southern coast-line is deeply indented by two large gulfs—the eastern, St. Vincent's Gulf, running inland to the northward for 85 miles, and the larger, Spencer's Gulf, running N.N.E. for 180 miles. These gulfs have a mean breadth of 80 and 50 miles respectively, and both taper towards their northern ends. St. Vincent's Gulf is sheltered by Kangaroo Island, 90 miles in length, which lies to the southward of it, leaving two fine entrances, one from the westward through Investigator's Straits 28 miles broad, and the other from the eastward through Backstairs Passage 8 miles in width.

The principal agricultural and mineral districts of the Colony, are contiguous to the two gulfs, the shores of which are 780 miles in length, the greater part being entirely protected from the ocean swell. Numerous outports and shipping places, of which there are over 50, enable settlers to ship their produce at a very small cost. These gulfs are divided by Yorke's Peninsula, some 120 miles long, and 20 miles broad, having large tracts of wheat-growing land, and the principal seat of mining industry.

Adelaide, the capital of the Province, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

General Government.

The Constitution granted to South Australia by Her Majesty, by virtue of Imperial Act 13 and 14 Vic., c. 59, was proclaimed on the 24th October, 1856, on which day the Queen's assent to the Constitution Act No. 2 of 1856-6 was received in the Colony. Under that Statute the Parliament consists of two Houses—the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly; the former being composed of 18 members, and the latter, at that time, of 36. In 1878 the electoral districts of the House of Assembly were increased from 18 to 22, and the number of members from 36 to 46.

The Legislative Council, which cannot be dissolved by the Governor, is elected by ballot, the whole Province forming one electoral district for that purpose. Each member is elected for twelve years; and every four years the six members who have been longest on the roll of the Council retire. The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the Queen, and that he has resided in the Province for three years. The qualification of a voter for this branch of the Legislature is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and have been on the electoral roll for a period of six months. He must also either be possessed of a freehold of the value of 50l. or of a leasehold of the annual value of 20l. having three years to run, or with right of purchase, or be in occupation of a dwelling-house of the annual rent value of 25l.

The constitution of the Legislative Council is unaltered by the late amendment of the Electoral Act. The total number of voters for the Legislative Council is 21,507, or about 40 per cent. of the adult male population.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; and of the 22 districts represented in it, three return three members each, eighteen two members each, and the other returns one member only. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a Member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, and have been six months on the electoral roll. The total number of electors on the roll for the Assembly is 41,223, or about 75 per cent. of the adult male population.

Responsible Government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature who form the Cabinet, and who are ex officio members of the Executive Council, namely, the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, Commissioner of Public Works, and Minister of Education.

Population.

The population of the Colony at the close of 1877 was estimated to be 237,090 persons; showing an increase during the twelve months of 11,413 persons. Of these numbers 6,008 represents the increase by immigration.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide number about 35,000 persons, and of the suburbs 25,000,
while about 75 per cent. of the whole population are resident in the country districts, and are employed directly or indirectly in the cultivation of the soil, or in the production of mineral and pastoral wealth.

The South Australian born preponderate and form 55 per cent. of the population; the next largest class being persons of English birth, who form 26 per cent. Ireland has contributed 8 per cent., and Germany and Scotland each 4½ per cent. The proportion of males and females in the settled districts is about equal.

About 85 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 27 per cent.

Omitting children under five years of age, 75 per cent. of the population can read and write, 14 per cent. can only read, and 10 per cent. can neither read nor write. Of the rising youth, say from 15 to 21 years of age, 91 per cent. can read and write, 6 per cent. can read only, and only 3 in every 100 are totally uneducated.

The average birth-rate is 37 per 1,000 of the population. The number of marriages registered in 1877 was 2,002.

The average death-rate in South Australia is 15 per 1,000, as compared with 22 per 1,000 in England.

Immigration and Emigration.

In 1877, 15,016 persons arrived in South Australia, and 9,008 left it, yielding an increase of the population from this source of 6,008 persons. The sum voted by Parliament for the introduction of immigrants during the coming year will be sufficient for the introduction of about 5,000 adults, or 400 souls monthly.

In the present industrial circumstances of South Australia, a steady and moderate increase of manpower, suitable to the requirements of the country, is an absolute necessity. Such additional labour will be readily absorbed into the general population without producing any disturbance of social interests.

Education.

During the year 1876 a new Education Act was passed, providing that the future management of public education should be committed to a Council, with a paid president and a staff of officers directly responsible to the Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free to those who cannot afford to pay a small fee; and compulsory wherever practicable. Provision is also made for the establishment of model and training schools, of Boards of Advice, and for the systematic examination of teachers, their classification according to their attainments and proficiency, and for scholarships.

With a view of fostering and encouraging the growth of a comprehensive system of public instruction, the following grants of money and land have lately been made:—Towards the expenses of the Education Department, payment of teachers, &c., a yearly sum of £60,000; and a like amount for the erection of public school-buildings. 120,000 acres of the public estate were also granted to the Council, and provision made for setting apart 20,000 acres in future years. To the University of Adelaide, lately established, an annual grant of five per cent. on all sums contributed to the University from private sources (at present amounting to over £40,000), and also an endowment of 50,000 acres of land. For the maintenance of Institutes, and for the erection or buildings connected with them, the sum of £16,000.

Public Worship.

The voluntary principle, or freedom of religion from State assistance and consequent control, was established in South Australia from the date of its foundation. The number of churches and other buildings used for public worship is 890, providing 138,460 sittings.

The number of Sunday Schools is 560, attended by 87,938 children, instructed by 4,905 teachers.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the Province consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; and Police Magistrates' Courts.

Local Courts of civil jurisdiction are established in all the principal towns throughout the Province, arranged in circuits, and presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates.

The annual number of convictions in the Supreme Court has averaged during the last three years 72, or only one in 3,000 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. Where almost every man is a landowner, or is interested in land—either as vendor or vendee, lessor or lessee, mortgagor or mortgagee—dealings in real estate become a matter of almost every day occurrence. It may be said to be quite exceptional for an individual in South Australia not to be, more or less, personally interested in the establishment of a simple and inexpensive method of dealing with this description of property. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community. The total value of the lands brought under the operation of this law amounts to over ten millions sterling.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of moneys, by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes. The amount of the Public Debt outstanding on 31st December, 1877, was £4,737,200, and the total rate of indebtedness per head of the population was 20l. Against this liability, a sum of £3,589,068 remains due to Government, for 2,507,914 acres of land sold under the credit system.

The earlier loans were issued bearing 6 per cent. interest, but those of late years bear 4 per cent. only. The present price of South Australian Four Per Cents. is about 97. Interest and redemption are payable in London, on 1st January and 1st July in
each year. The currency of the bonds is generally 30 years.

Banking.

Seven banking institutions carry on business within the Province, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland townships—numbering altogether 64 branches and agencies. The total average liabilities of the seven banks amount to £4,172,201, and the total average assets to £6,732,015.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 36 branches. The total number of depositors is 29,088; the average sum at the credit of each being £41. The total deposits of the year amounted to £95,256, and the total funds of the institution to £1,026,302.—invested chiefly in Government securities and on mortgage of freehold property. In South Australia one in ten of the population are depositors in savings banks.

Land, and its Occupation.

Excluding that portion of the Province known as the Northern Territory, the total area of South Australia is about 380,070 square miles, or 243,244,860 acres. It may be roughly estimated that not more than 250,000 square miles are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 150 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached no further than 500 miles—although squatters have lately taken up large areas of land discovered by recent explorations (lying chiefly on the route of the overland telegraph), and which are considered capable of carrying stock. Thirty-five counties have been proclaimed up to 31st December, 1877, embracing 55,471 square miles, or 35,501,440 acres. Of this large area only 7,477,911 acres have been alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to about 30 acres for every man, woman, and child in the Colony, or 120 acres for each male adult. About one in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to sale, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 1,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, &c. This land is thrown open for selection in large quantities—from 50,000 to 200,000 acres being put up at one time. At present there is as much as 1,350,000 acres of land surveyed and open for immediate selection.

Agriculture.

About two-thirds of the total area of land cultivated is cropped with wheat, of which cereal 1,163,646 acres were reaped last year. The area of wheat grown has increased more than 100 per cent during the last 10 years.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry. There are over 5,000 acres of land devoted to this purpose. The produce of these vineyards for the year ended December, 1877, was 339,277 gallons of wine—about 150 gallons per acre. The suitability of the soil and climate of South Australia to the growth of wine was soon discovered by the earlier settlers, some of whom had brought from Europe a variety of high-class vine cuttings. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

The introduction of flax-growing into the ordinary routine of farm operations has been followed by considerable success. The prices realized for this commodity in the European markets have been very encouraging.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants. This branch of industry will probably soon develop into an export trade.

Almond trees are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment.

South Australia possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and general superiority over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a first position in the local market. The produce of the plantations is eagerly purchased by persons who have entered upon the business of the manufacture of oil.

Pastoral Occupation.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. At the present time there are no less than 390,000* square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 110,684; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 230,679; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to over 6,098,000, whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 139,000 bales.

Manufactures.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, viz., 85 steam flour mills with 1,500 horse-power, driving 275 pairs of stones; 4 meat-preserving establishments; 8 boiling-down works; 60 tanneries and fellmongeries; several large wool-washing works; 10 soap and candle factories; 5 bone-dust mills; 2 glue and size works; 31 steam saw-mills; 27 foundries; 86 agricultural implement works (chiefly for reaping and winnowing machines); 29 coach and waggon-builders' shops; 1 woollen tweed factory; 6 clothing factories; 4 hat factories; 12 boot and shoe factories; 4 dye works; 8 flax mills; 8 rope walks; 2 brush manufactories; 29 breweries; 30 sodawater and cordial factories; 102 wine-making establishments; 10 biscuit bakeries; 10 jam and preserves; 7 confectionery manufactories; 6 dried fruits and 3 olive oil factories, and 1 ice-works. In addition to 5 patent ships, there are 8 ship and 12 boat-building yards. Several marble and 16 slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened.

The gasworks of the Colony are eight in number,

* Including Northern Territory.
of which two are for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, and the remaining five are in the principal country towns.

Import and Export Trade.

The combined import and export trade of 1877 amounted to 9,252,031l. sterling, of which 4,625,500l. were imports, and 4,626,531l. exports.

Of the total imports, more than one-half, viz., 2,828,834l., came from the United Kingdom. Of the total exports products representing 2,542,806l. were exported to the mother country.

It appears that out of 3,922,962l. worth of staple produce exported, the value of breadstuffs amounted to 1,184,368l.; that wool represented 1,886,000l., and copper 565,099l.

South Australian wheat and flour command the highest price in the markets of the world. The great bulk of the crop is shipped to the United Kingdom.

The total value of wool shipped in 1856 was 412,163l.; 1866, 990,163l.; and in 1877 it reached 1,886,000l. sterling.

Roads.

There are 3,113 miles of road defined in the settled districts. During the past 20 years, about 1,750,000l. have been devoted to these works, and, with the exception of 200,000l., the whole cost has been defrayed from the General Revenue — no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 1,025. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

Lighthouses.

The coast of South Australia is well lighted, first-class lighthouses having been erected on Capes Borda and Willoughby, Kangaroo Island, on Troubridge Island, and at the entrance to Port Adelaide, in St. Vincent's Gulf; on Tipara Shoal, in Spencer Gulf; and on Capes Jervis, Jaffa, and Northumberland. There are also other smaller lighthouses. The total cost of maintenance of lighthouses in 1877 was 7,065l., and the amount of light dues received 6,848l.*

Railways.

The mileage of railways opened for traffic in the Colony is 347 and the mileage of new lines in course of construction is 404. The total receipts from the Government railways during 1877, amounted to 198,023l., and the expenditure to 180,013l. Up to December 31st, 1877, the total receipts from railways reached 2,375,092l., and the expenditure to 2,106,277l., showing a balance of 268,815l. The amount defrayed in the construction of railways to that date was 2,700,404l.

Telegraphs.

The geographical position of South Australia being practically that of the most western of the group, the first port of arrival and the last of departure for mail communication with Great Britain and the East, necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford instantaneous communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. In order to accomplish direct telegraphic communication with Europe, from which such great results have flowed, and an immense area of territory opened up for settlement, South Australia, at her own risk and cost—which has amounted to over 400,000l.—erected a line of telegraph some 2,200 miles in length, across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party.

At the close of the year 1877 there were 112 stations, and 5,153 miles of line open throughout the Colony, and there are several lines now in course of construction.

There is now through communication with all the sister Colonies—Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, New Zealand, and Western Australia, thereby completing the chain which unites the whole of the British possessions at the antipodes with the mother country and the rest of the civilized world.

Climate and Meteorology.

The climate of South Australia is remarkable for its dryness, and owing to this cause, the heat, except on hot wind days, is seldom oppressive. When a fierce hot wind is blowing, and the thermometer stands perhaps at something over 100°, the wet bulb thermometer will show 63°, and it is this peculiarity which enables persons to bear the heat of the South Australian summer, and carry on their usual pursuits with less inconvenience and discomfort than is felt in tropical and damp climates, though the temperature may be 15° or 20° lower than in South Australia.

The hottest months in the year are December, January, and February, when the temperature on the plains frequently exceeds 100° in the shade. November and March are also hot, but the nights, especially in the former month, are cooler, and the heat is seldom of long duration, rarely reaching 100° in the shade, and coming in suddenly with a strong hot wind, is followed quickly by a change to cool or even cold weather. A few hot days occasionally occur in October, but even in the hottest months, especially in December, the weather is often broken by cloudy, cold intervals, with strong south-west winds, veering gradually to south and south-east. This state of things will continue for several days, during which the wind from the south-east will usually freshen towards sunset, a bank of cloud forming over the Mount Lofty Ranges with cold nights, the temperature falling rapidly after sunset.

After March, the temperature falls rapidly, very rarely reaching 90° in the shade in April (only six times in five years), the mean temperature for that month, deduced from ten years' observations, being 64·6, or 5·5 below that of the preceding month, whilst for May it is only 58·2. The coldest months are June, July, and August, the mean monthly temperature of which are 54·4, 51·5, and 53·7 respectively.

The climate, with few exceptions, is all that Europeans could desire; it is a climate of blue skies, bright sunshine, and mild genial weather, varied by sufficient rainfall and moisture in most years, and marked by an almost entire absence of those fierce commotions which elsewhere bring destruction and dismay. Hurricanes may be said to be unknown, fogs are rare, earthquakes, which have been occasionally noted, are confined to a few slight tremors and rumblings. Everything is favourable to health and peaceful industry.
