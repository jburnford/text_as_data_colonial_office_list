ST. LUCIA.

The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus, during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situate in 13° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 42 miles in length, and 21 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is one hundred and fifty miles, and its area 158,620 acres. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, contains about 900 houses, and a population of about 3,500 souls. Next in importance is the town of Soufriere, containing a population of 1,800 souls.

At the period of its discovery, St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to M.M. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to M.M. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent d'Orléans made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-le-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Ilet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.
In 1798, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms, on the 4th of April, 1794, on which day H.R.H. the Duke of Kent, father of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, placed the British colours on the principal fortress.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

Sir John Moore, the future hero of Corunna, who greatly distinguished himself in this campaign, was appointed Governor of the island, which post he held till the beginning of 1797.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Greenfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by intestine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. However, each census shows an improvement in this respect, and in the fifteen years between 1861 and 1876 the population has increased by 8,174, and now amounts to 34,848. This increase has been entirely a natural one, there having been no immigration from the East since 1861, and the number of arrivals from Barbados having been exceeded by departures of Coolies. The registration (instituted in 1869) exhibits an annual excess of births over deaths of about 600, or nearly 2 per cent. of the population—a fact which, considered in connection with the absence, until lately, of all professional assistance in the great majority of cases requiring medical and surgical treatment, shows that the reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is completely undeserved. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation. Among the 900 or thereabout of white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are unknown; and no case of yellow fever has occurred for years. Probably no climate in the world is more suitable as a winter resort for invalids suffering from chest complaints. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera.

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy. The Courts of Justice were an inferior Court called the "Séné-haussée," and a higher Court called the "Conseil Supérieur," or Court of appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided, and it was invested with certain executive and administrative functions.

The Government is now conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council of four members. The Legislature consists of the Administrator and a Council, in which he presides, consisting of four official and six unofficial members. Law is administered by a judge, from whom in civil cases there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Windward Islands, and by three magistrates, whose decisions are liable to review by the judge. In criminal cases tried in the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of twelve, as in England.

One of the most important changes effected in the laws and institutions of the Colony, was the enactment, in 1883, of the "Saisie Réelle" Ordnance, authorising the levy and sale of immoveable property. This law has served all the purposes of an "Encumbered Estates Act."
