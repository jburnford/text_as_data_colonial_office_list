NATAL.

Discovery and Early History.

The Colony of Natal derives its name from the fact of its discovery by Vasco de Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas-day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about eight hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between 29th and 31st parallels of S. lat.: it is bounded by the Tugela and Umzimkulu Rivers, and by the Drakensberg Mountains. It comprises an area of about thirteen millions and a half of acres, and has a seaboard of one hundred and seventy miles. The country is broken and rugged, and transit is consequently extremely difficult. The scenery in Natal in parts is picturesque in the extreme; waterfalls abound. Natal is a well-watered country, no less than 23 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the one hundred and fifty miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco de Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The crew spent some twelve months there engaged in building a small vessel from the fragments of the wreck. Having accomplished their task, they sailed for the Cape, leaving behind them four Englishmen, three of whom were subsequently taken off by a Dutch ship which visited the coast. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Marines, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonize it. Though the British Government declined to recognize or aid him in his plans, he induced some twenty enterprising individuals to join him in this undertaking. On their arrival they placed themselves in relation with the king of the country, Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country. He sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up at his death, about four years later. The tribes thus amalgamated by Chaka have been known since under the general title of Zulus, and form an independent kingdom to the north of Natal.

Towards the close of the year 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to his brother Chaka. During the next two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with various success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a detachment of troops for the purpose. This detachment was shortly withdrawn, and after the lapse of a brief interval a second force, under Captain Smith, was sent (1840). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete, with whom a junction was effected. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

Constitution.

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In August, 1845, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. And in November of the same year other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, as well as an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1848, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, and from that time has not been under the control of the Governor of the Cape. Its affairs are administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, composed originally of four official members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and 12 members elected by the counties and boroughs.

Under the Supplementary Charter of December, 1869, two members of the Legislative Council are elected members of the Executive Council, whilst the number of official members of the Legislative and Executive Councils was increased to five by the admission of the Protector of Immigrants, for whom the Colonial Engineer has been substituted by additional letters patent dated the 21st of December, 1876.

The elected members of Council hold their seats for four years from date of election, unless the Council is dissolved by the Governor. There are 8 electoral districts, and possession of property to the value of 50l., or rents from property of an annual value of 10l., entitles a man to a vote; the usual
provisions respecting the disqualification of aliens, and others hold good. No person can be elected a member of Council, unless he is a duly qualified and registered elector, nor unless he shall have been invited to become a candidate for election by at least 10 electors of the county or borough which it is proposed he shall represent: nor unless such requisition shall have been transmitted to the Resident Magistrate, at least fourteen days before the election. The Reserved Civil List is fixed at 40,100l. under the Supplementary Charter of 1872.

By Law No. 1 of 1873 the number of official members of the Legislative Council was increased to 5, and the number of elected members to 15. By Act No. 3 of 1875 the number of nominated members was increased to 13, including the 5 official members.

Native Affairs.

In autumn 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amalubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, entered on a somewhat consumptive course of conduct towards the local government, ending in an attempt to escape from the Colony into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force, consisting of regulars, volunteers, and natives, was dispatched against the Tribe, and at one point, in the Bushman's River Pass, a portion of the force came into collision with the rear-guard of the tribe, when three European volunteers were shot down, and two natives. Langalibalele and many of the tribe were met and secured in Basutoland by Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Orpen, Agents of the Cape Government, and given up to the Natal force which was in pursuit, under Mr. Alliason and Mr. Hawkins. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under what is called "native law," the principal offenders being tried by a Court over which the Lieutenant-Governor himself presided. About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. The neighbouring tribe of Putini, which had harboured the women and cattle of the Amalubi Tribe, were subjected to similar confiscation, but the property of the Tribe has been restored to them. Langalibalele and his son were transported to Robben Island, in the Cape of Good Hope, by the Legislature of which Colony an Act was passed sanctioning their detention.

Her Majesty's Government having formed the opinion that the punishment inflicted on the Chief was excessive, this Act was repealed by the Cape Parliament, by a second Act which provided for the removal of Langalibalele and his son to the mainland to be at large under regulations framed by the Governor of the Cape in Council. The members of the tribe have been practically amnestied and accorded liberty to settle peaceably in the Colony, though not to occupy their former location as a tribe.

The Langalibalele affair brought into prominence the system under which the native population had been managed by the Natal Government, and Sir Garnet Wolseley was specially commissioned to proceed to the Colony as administrator, and to consider and report upon the Native question, and the question of defence. He was accompanied and assisted in his task by four officers, who had served under him with distinction during the Ashanti war, namely: Colonel Colley, C.B., Lieut.-Colonel Brackenbury, R.A., C.B., Major Butler, C.B., and Captain Lord Gifford, V.C.

The Native population has hitherto been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew the natives from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crimes mala in se. The native population was debarred from the franchise, but by an Act of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law, in which case he would be entitled to all the rights of an ordinary Colonist. The tribes live apart, upon locations provided for them by the Government. They have enjoyed their tribal organisation, and lived in polygamy. But besides these there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms.

It is now proposed, as a result of the recommendations of Sir Garnet Wolseley, and the deliberations of Her Majesty's Government, to break down as much as possible the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the Chiefs. A law has been passed establishing a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and by this law the natives are placed under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. A white magistrate is to be placed with every tribe, who will be the administrator of justice in civil matters, and will supersede the authority of the Chiefs, and it is hoped gradually to accustom the Kafirs to regular industry, and the individual ownership of property in the civilised way. By a law, No. 13 of 1875, an existing tax of 5l. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s.

Railways.

An Act was passed by the Legislative Council, in 1875, authorising the construction of a railway from Pietermaritzburg to the Port of Durban, 78 miles, with a branch northwards from Umgeni to Verulam, 19½ miles, and one south to the Isipingo River, 7 miles. The estimated cost of the work, £1,200,000, has been raised by loan; the contract taken by Messrs. Wythes and Jackson. The first sod was turned by the Lieutenant-Governor on the 1st of January, 1876.

A portion of the north coast line as far as the Avoca, in extent 8 miles, and to Pine Town, on the main line, a distance of 17 miles is open for traffic, and the whole of the north and south coast lines will be open by the end of the current year (written in October, 1878).

The main line will, it is expected, be finished by the end of 1879.

The railway between the Port of Natal and the River Umigun, which was bought by the Government for the sum of 40,000l., has been connected with the Government Railway.

Defence.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of September, 1878, consisted of 735 of all ranks.

There is also an armed and mounted police force, numbering 200 of all ranks.
Missionaries.

There are various missionary establishments in Natal, supported by voluntary aid, for the advancement of the 350,000 Zulu-Kafir subjects of the Queen. The Church of England, the Wesleyans, the Americans, the Prussians, the Hanoverians, the Norwegians, and the Church of Rome, all have their stations.
