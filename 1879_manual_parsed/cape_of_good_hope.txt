CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is washed by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north by the Orange River, on the north-east by Natal, and on the east by certain districts of Native Kaffraria still independent. The Cape Colony, with adjacent territories (Basutoland and British Transkei), contains an area of 222,308 square miles; the area of the Colony being 199,950, of Basutoland 10,293, and of the Transkeian territories 12,065 square miles.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, it was, however, in 1856, constituted a separate Colony.

By an Act of the Colonial Legislature, No. 12 of 1871, the country known as Basutoland—which on the 13th March, 1868, had been proclaimed British territory—was annexed to the Cape. In consideration, however, of the peculiar circumstances of the Basuto community, the incorporation of the country was expressly declared not to render it subject to the general law of the Colony; but its affairs are for the present administered by the Governor, who has appointed an Agent and Resident Magistrates in the Territory.

In 1876 Her Majesty's sovereignty was extended over large tracts of Native Kaffraria, including Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, and Griqualand East. These districts will for the future be subject to the Cape Legislature and Parliament as is Basutoland.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walwich Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn was proclaimed British territory.

History and Conquest.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeek, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burghers, who were thereby continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince as conveyed to him by the British Commander, and the British Force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid and considerable progress owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurweldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of
its colonization as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of £50,000l. to promote emigration to the Cape, by means of which 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole southeastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory. But Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, who thought the Kaffirs had had much excuse for their invasion, reversed this act. In 1846 the second Kaffir war began, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third and most prolonged Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and which in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population, who were so estranged from the British Government that they preferred the perils of the wilderness to remaining under our rule. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonization of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:—1. General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. 2. Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. 3. Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the then Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle killing delusion preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. The most important event in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which has undoubtedly been one of the main causes of the increase in recent years of the prosperity of the Colony. The measure of that prosperity may be judged from the fact that while the shipping inwards in 1870 amounted to 335,509 tons, in 1877 it amounted to 1,262,557 tons, and in the same period the imports rose from 2,352,043l. in value to 5,158,348l. in value.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to people of European birth: the temperature at Cape Town, by tables compiled by Sir Thomas Maclear, when Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope, is shown to be less variable than in most countries: the average temperature in winter is but 14-86° below that of summer: the mean temperature is 61-28°, the highest is 98-8°, the lowest 37-70°. The summer begins in November and lasts till April, when winter commences.

Consumption, in its early stages, has been entirely eradicated by residence at the Cape.

In the western portions of the Colony the rain falls during the winter months; but in other parts the summer is the wet season.

Hot winds are sometimes felt in the eastern districts, and thunder and hailstorms are common in the north and east portions of the Colony, which, on the whole, is the statistics of the Army Medical Department, stands as one of the healthiest in the world. Diseases of the lungs are rare, and there is a remarkable exemption from cholera, fevers, &c. The following table shows the highest and lowest temperature, and the rainfall registered at certain localities:

| Location                        | Highest | Lowest | Rainfall |
|---------------------------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Royal Observatory (near the coast) | 99-5    | 89-8   | 24       |
| Mossel Bay (on the coast)       | 97-0    | 93-0   | —        |
| Worcester (60 miles inland)     | 106-5   | 29-5   | 12       |
| Grahamstown (36 miles inland, but elevated) | 106-5 | 32-5   | 32       |
| Graaff Reinet (inland and shut in) | 105-0 | 28-0   | 13       |
| Aliwal North (inland, elevated, and open) | 93-0 | 20-0   | 25       |

Industries.

The colonists at the Cape are chiefly employed in the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and in the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of this Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked.

Ostrich breeding is now carried on with marked success in all parts of the Colony. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in several districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1877 it amounted to 65,496 lbs.
The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—385 lbs., 403,153 lbs., and 1,433,774 lbs. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 36,020,871 lbs. in 1877.

The censuses of 1865 and 1875 supply the following information regarding agricultural produce:

| Produce                  | 1865          | 1875          |

As to agricultural implements and industries the 1875 Census gives the following particulars:—

Number of ploughs 28,416, harrows 10,580, reaping machines 219, threshing machines 332, grain crushing machines 24, hay cutting machines 148, winnowing machines 129, maize cleaners 150, corn mills 1,635, saw mills 31, woolwashing machines 57, tannery machines 306, brewery machines 46, distillery 1,444. Statistics of manufactories and works are incomplete, but the undermentioned information was obtained in 1877 as regards cities and towns:—

Number of boot works 130, bread works 166, brick works 101, jams, &c., works, 26, cooperages 27, gun works 9, iron foundries 18, iron and tin works 48, printing establishments 47, saddlery works 90, tobacco works 57, wagon and cart works 244.

The chief exports of the Colony are aloes, argol, copper ore, grain, ostrich feathers, fish, dried fruit, angola hair, hides, horns, ivory, diamonds, skins, wine, and wool.

Railways and Public Works.

Under Act 15 of 1872, the Government took over the Wellington Railway at a cost of £780,000l., since then the Uitenhage Railway at 63,760l., and under Act 8 of 1876 it has acquired the Wynberg Line for 75,000l.

By an Act of 1874, the Cape Government was authorized to spend a sum not exceeding 4,805,080l. in Railway Extension. The contemplated extensions amount to about 790 miles of iron road, and as originally devised, are shown in the accompanying map of South Africa.

The expenditure of a further sum of £1,865,658 for completing railways and carrying out additional works has been authorised by Act No. 26 of 1878.

The total expenditure on the construction of Government Railways to the 31st of December, 1877, was 5,024,626l. distributed as follows:—

Western System, 1,727,779l.; Midland and North Eastern System, 2,080,907l.; East London and Queenstown System, 1,215,939l.

The ultimate length of the various lines of rail in the Colony will be 969½ miles, 510 of which are now (September, 1878) open for traffic, and 459½ remain to be opened, and are now in course of construction, and 77 miles may be ready for carriage of passengers and goods in the next four months.

The particulars of each system are as follows:—

| System                          | Miles now open for traffic | Miles likely to be opened for trade at end of 1878 | Total length |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Western                         | 257                        | 302                                              | 403          |
| Midland & North Eastern         | 183                        | 208                                              | 399          |
| East London & Queenstown        | 70                         | 77                                               | 167½         |

The following comparative railway statistics are interesting:—The number of miles of railway open in December, 1873, was 634, and in 1877, 404½; the number of passengers in 1873 was 436,512, against 810,809 in 1877; the tonnage of goods in 1873 and 1877 was respectively 66,328 and 177,203; the total receipts increased in four years from 65,576l. to 216,569l., and the working expenses from 42,768l. to 179,833l.

Telegraphs.

Under a revised tariff, the highest rate charged for transmission of messages, except to the Free State and Griqualand West, is 2s. 6d. The Government took over the then existing line in July, 1873, and in December, 1874, there were 945 miles of wire, in December, 1877, there were 3,154; between those years the number of offices had increased from 22 to 82; the revenue from 9,252l. to 20,116l., the expenditure from 8,374l. to 25,625l., and the number of messages from 45,534 to 183,114.

The actual cost of construction up to end of 1877 was 185,831l. In August, 1878, there were 3,374 miles of wire and 92 offices. In 1878 an Act was passed for the promotion of telegraphic communication between the Cape and England.

Public Works.

The amounts expended by the Department of Public Works in 1876-7 for the services specified below were as follows:—

| Service                                      | £       |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| Works and Buildings                           | 47,002  |
| Roads and Bridges                            | 65,587  |
| Harbour Works and Orange River Bridges       | 126,478 |
|                                             | £239,067 |

The outlay on Public Works of every description in 1871 was 18,445l., in 1875, 1,298,583l., and in 1876-7, 2,283,614l.

Harbour Works on an extensive scale are being carried out at Cape Town, East London, Port Alfred, and Port Elizabeth. The Government outlay to June, 1877, on Harbour Improvements was, Port Alfred, 100,481l.; East London, 158,160l.; and Port Nolloth, 3,746l.

At Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, harbour works are being prosecuted under the control of Local Boards. The Board at the latter place has been authorized to raise money to the extent of 167,000l. for service of works in progress.

The Breakwater and “Alfred Docks” in Table Bay were executed at a cost of 443,201l. The dock itself has an area of 10 acres, and a depth at low water at northern end of 24 feet; the outer basin is 800 feet by 400 feet, and from 9 to 19 feet deep. The present length of the breakwater is 1,870 feet. Storage is afforded at the docks for 12,000 tons of goods. A graving dock 420 feet long, 68 and 90
feet wide, and 26 feet deep, is being made, at an estimated cost of £9,000. A railway runs from the docks to the Cape Town terminus.

Mines and Minerals.

A rich mine of Manganese ore, yielding seventy to ninety per cent., is being worked in the mountains opposite the Paarl, a town 35 miles distant from Cape Town by rail.

The Ookiep mine of the Cape Copper Company, in Namagualand, is believed to be one of the richest in the world. The yield is 12,000 tons a-year, with percentage of 33. Between Port Nolloth and Ookiep the Cape Copper Company has constructed a railway of 2 ft. 6 in. gauge, ninety-three miles long, at a cost of £18,100. Copper ore exported in 1852, 31 tons; in 1862, 3,396; in 1872, 13,240; and in 1877, 15,244.

Coal has been discovered in various localities in Southern Africa, over an area of 50,000 square miles. Another mine, Spatakal, yields about 250 tons a-month of 35 per cent. Mr. North, Colonial Mining Engineer, estimates the area of the Colonial coal field at 2,500,000 acres. Beds of this mineral are very extensive in the Stormberg. At a place called Molteno, mines have been worked since 1864; the annual produce is about 500 tons, but the percentage of ash is from 17 to 27. An extensive outcrop has been observed and worked at "the Camp," division of Wodehouse, 4,700 feet above sea level. Government reserve of three square miles on the Indwe River, 55 miles from Queenstown, which will soon be connected by rail with the seaport East London.

The Indwe coal gives 30 per cent. of ash, but the mineral may be used in specially constructed locomotives. An analysis by Dr. Hahn shows the following result:—Specific gravity, 1.587; carbon, 61.021; hydrogen, 3.208; nitrogen, 2.190; sulphur, 0.434; oxygen, 2.178; ash, 30.32. The Government Geologist in July, 1878, inspected a thick seam of coal giving a percentage of only 6 or 7 of ash, on a farm not far from Graaff Reinet.

Education.

To promote elementary day-school instruction of all children, give industrial training to native lads and girls, and supply superior instruction for those preparing for the University examinations, the Government gives grants of money in aid of salaries of lecturers and professors (under the Higher Education Act), and of other teachers under Act 13 of 1865, assistance in providing furniture, &c., allowances in aid of expenses of needy boarders at schools amongst the agricultural population, and allowances to maintain native boarders at industrial institutions. In 1854, 91 schools, at which 10,266 children attended, cost the Colony £7,593l., while during the year 1876-7 there were in the Colony, the Transkei and Basutoland, no less than 736 schools with 61,601 scholars. The Government expenditure on education in the financial year 1876-77 amounted to £8,856l.; as late as 1872 it was only £2,267l., the local expenditure being £60,803l. in 1876-7.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873, was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D., has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

Chancellor, Hon. Wm. Porter, C.M.G.

Vice-Chancellor, Hon. C. Abercrombie Smith, M.A.

The Council consists of 20 members. The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowments, &c. The following table shows the number of persons who—

| Matriculated | Took direct degrees | Were admitted ad eundum |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1874         | 31                  | 7                       | 13                      |

Sea and Land Communications.

Contracts have been entered into for weekly communication between England and the Cape, and vice versa, with the Union Steamship Company and Messrs. Donald Currie & Co. The packets leave England on Fridays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Tuesdays, the passage to be effected in 26 days, and in 27 days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena or Ascension, but premiums are paid for quicker runs. The average passage is 24 days. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed.

Steamers leave Table Bay three times a month for Natal (distant about 1,000 miles), calling at Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and East London, to land and embark passengers; they usually leave about 48 hours after the arrival of the English mail.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A Union Company steamer leaves Table Bay once a month for Zanzibar, touching at Port Elizabeth, Natal, Delagoa Bay, Inhambane, Quilimane, and Mozambique.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns, and with Griqualand West (Diamond Fields) three times a week, with Natal once a week, via the Transkei, and once via the Orange Free State, and with the Transvaal once a week through the Diamond Fields.

Communication by railway is carried on twice a day between East London and King William's Town, and the same facility will shortly be afforded between Port Elizabeth and Grahamstown.

The number of Colonial post office is 246, of post office agencies, 299, and of money order offices, 66. The expenditure on the postal service in 1873 amounted to £63,297, and to £151,221 in 1877; the revenue from postage in 1873 was £41,478 and from money orders £909, the corresponding figures for 1877 were £57,687 and £1,698. The weight of registered packets, addressed to England and supposed to contain diamonds, which passed the Post Office in the years 1874 to 1877, both inclusive, amounts to 2,676 lbs.

Chief Towns.

Cape Town, which has a population of 33,239, and with suburbs, 45,240, is laid out at right angles, and contains numerous handsome shops, offices, and churches. The finest building is the edifice containing the Library and Museum, the former of which has upwards of 40,000 volumes on its shelves.

Port Elizabeth, the second town of the Colony, has a population of 13,049; and Graham's-town, one of 6,903; King William's Town, 5,169; Paarl, 5,760; Graaff Reinet, 4,562; Worcester, 3,788; Queenstown, 2,320; East London, 2,134.
Government.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Local Parliamentary (or "Responsible") Government was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872. There is a Legislative Council of 21 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 68 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony. The Colonial Ministers are the Colonial Secretary (who is Premier), the Treasurer-General, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President.

Act No. 18 of 1874 (which takes effect at the next ensuing general election) provides for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of £2,000l., or movable property worth £4,000l. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified by possession of property, or receipt of salary or wages, of not less than £50l. per annum, or not less than £25l. with board and lodging. The number of registered electors in 1877 was 45,825.

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The Judicial establishment comprises the "Supreme Court" of three Judges, who hold Sessions in Cape Town and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, and "The Eastern Districts Court," the two Judges of which hold Sessions in Grahamstown and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. Several Acts for the more effectual defence of the Colony were passed during the session of 1878, viz., Cape Mounted Yeomanry Act, Burgher Force and Levies Act, Cape Mounted Riflemen Act, Volunteer Act, Peace Preservation Act.

Native Affairs.

The condition and progress of the native population within the Cape Colony engages much attention, and a blue book is annually laid before the Cape Parliament containing reports from the various magistrates and agents resident both upon the districts within the Colony occupied by Kaffirs, and in the countries of the native chiefs beyond the border which are more or less subject to the influence and authority of the Governor of the Cape, as Her Majesty's High Commissioner.

Everywhere increase of tillage, trade, and personal property are reported, and a growing desire for European clothes and other commodities of civilized life. The great vice of the people appears to be a tendency to brandy drinking, but this is not carried to outrageous excess. The most marked progress is reported from Basutoland, which is under the able superintendence of Mr. C. D. Griffith, until lately, Governor's Agent. This territory, when taken over by Great Britain, was in a pitiable state of desolation and anarchy. It is now peaceable and prosperous, and a feeling of attachment to the British Government is everywhere manifested by the people, if not by their chiefs.

The country is about 150 miles long and 50 wide, and contains 10,293 square miles.

This land of mountain and grass is well watered and enjoys a delicious climate. The scenery is grand and in many parts extremely beautiful.

Population, 1875.—European, 469,169; Native, 127,707.

Stock, etc.—35,257 horses, draught cattle 28,626, other 188,791, sheep, wooled, 240,270, other 49,537, goats, angora, 13,592, other 147,162, pigs 15,236, ploughs 2,770, harrows 269.

Revenue, 1875—16,523l.; 1876—17,339l. (excluding advances).

Expenditure, 1875—12,773l.; 1876—16,989l.

Balance, 30th June, 1877—22,057l.

Productions.—Wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron and copper, and coal has been found and is used in some parts.

Considerable progress has also been made in settling the affairs of native Kaffraria beyond the Kei. The Fingoes of this country are, indeed, regarded as evincing a greater aptitude for civilisation than any other branch of the Kaffir race. Letters Patent have been issued for the annexation of Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and No-man's-land (Griqualand, East.) In 1876, the Cape Parliament adopted a resolution advising annexation of Walwich Bay, a district on the coast north of the Orange River. The annexation was effected by Commander Dyer, R.N., on the 12th of March last, and has been confirmed by Her Majesty's letters patent.

The Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-3, have recently defied the authority of the British Government, and even invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Mr. C. D. Griffith, now Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their country has been overrun, and Kreli has been deposed and his country has been confiscated, and will be hereafter disposed of as may seem just.

Under Proclamation No. 68 of the 4th September, 1878, Umuukela, for breach of treaty arrangements, has ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Pondoa, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River has been vested in Her Majesty's Government. Two Presidents have been appointed—Major Elliott, at 800l., and the Rev. J. Oxley Oxlaid, at 600l. The Cape Colony customs dues are levied.
