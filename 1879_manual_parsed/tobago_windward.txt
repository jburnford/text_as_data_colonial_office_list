TOBAGO.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1626 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1643, James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1648 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1659 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole Island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a Company of London merchants. In 1748 by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce, but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Boullion, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. In March, 1793, it was captured by a British Force under Admiral Laforey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803, by Commander Hood and General Greenfield; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

It is the most southerly of the Windward group of the British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9', W. long. 60° 12'; distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 20 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Trinidad by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 18½ miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 32 miles long and from 6 to 12 broad, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,280 acres.

The formation of the island is volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 20 miles in length.

Sugar, rum, and molasses form the principal articles of export. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 10 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town has a population of about 1,200. The mails and passengers from the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's vessels are landed at Scarborough. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, has good anchorage, and the only danger is from a rock called the Beef Barrel, and frequent heavy surfs. There is a lighthouse at Bacolo Point Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

The Government is administered by a resident Lieutenant-Governor, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Barbados. There were formerly two Legislative Houses,—the Legislative Council and the Elective Legislative Assembly. The Council was composed of seven members, appointed by the Queen.

The Assembly consisted of 16 members, elected by the registered voters of the seven parishes into which the island is divided, each parish returning two representatives, and the towns of Scarborough and Plymouth one each.

The first constitution was given to the Colony in 1769, and the seat of the Legislature transferred from Georgetown, Barbados Bay, to Scarborough.
The constitution was remodelled in 1855 by a local Act, Vict. 18, cap. 7, entitled "An Act for the better Government of this Island," which, in addition to the Legislative Council and Elective Legislative Assembly, established a Privy Council and an Executive Committee.

The Executive Committee consisted of one Member of the Legislative Council and two Members of the Elective Legislative Assembly, selected by the Lieutenant-Governor, and holding office during pleasure. Their duties were to advise and assist the Governor in the general administration of the affairs of the island, and to prepare and perfect all estimates and ways and means. They were the official organs of communication between the Governor and the respective Legislative Chambers. They formed a Board of Audit of Public Accounts, and are also Commissioners under the Hurricane Loan Act. They received a salary of 100l. per annum each, and had a Secretary receiving also 100l. per annum. The Members of the Executive Committee sat as Privy Councillors in virtue of their office, but ceased to be Members of the Privy Council on their retirement from the Executive Committee.

The constitution was further remodelled by an Act No. IX of 1874, which abolished the two Legislative Houses, and established in lieu thereof one Legislative Assembly, consisting of six Members nominated by the Government and eight elected,—one by the town of Scarborough and one by each of the seven parishes, the qualification of electors remaining the same as before. The Privy Council was continued and the Executive Committee, which however was reduced to two Members, one a nominee Member of the Assembly, and the other an elected Member. And their emoluments were reduced to 50l. a-year each. The Legislative Assembly thus created, has since abolished itself and empowered Her Majesty to constitute a Legislature for the Island. This Act has been ratified by the Imperial Act 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47 (alluded to under previous articles, St. Vincent and Grenada). A Legislative Council has been established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

Riots occurred in the Windward District in May, 1876. Forty-two persons concerned in these riots were indicted for murder, of whom sixteen were sentenced to death. They were all subsequently reprieved and sentenced to various terms of penal servitude. In consequence of these riots, the Police Force was reorganized and increased in numbers, and made a semi-military force.

The moneys in circulation are British coins, doubloons, dollars, American eagles and dollars, and their parts, with Colonial bank-notes. The weights and measures are the British imperial.
