JAMAICA.

An island situated in the Caribbean Sea, and to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 40' and 18° 30', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 30'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 140 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,200 square miles.

Jamaica was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola. It capitulated, after a trilling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. After the capture of the island, until the Restoration of Charles II., Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction. In 1660 the first establishment of a regular civil government was made by Charles II., who appointed G. D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid. In 1807 the Slave Trade was abolished, at which time there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners; being rather more than 19l. a head on a slave population of 309,338.

Climate.

There is great variety of climate; the medium heat at Kingston is about 80°, and the minimum 70° Fahrenheit throughout the year; at an elevation of from 4,000 to 5,000 feet, the average mean range is 60° to 70°, the minimum in winter being 44°; on the Blue Mountain Peak ice of some thickness has been found in March. Owing to the lofty mountains which run down the middle of the whole Island, it is possible, in a few hours, to get to a climate resembling that of Europe. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 30° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours. In the St. Andrew's mountains the variation is never more than ten degrees between night and day; and the same between summer and winter. The hottest days in summer being never above 80°, and the coldest nights in winter never below 60°. Jamaica is singularly free from hurricanes or earthquakes. The rainy seasons are in May and October, and last for about three weeks, with intervals of fine weather. The May seasons are irregular, but the October seasons seldom fail. The rainfall varies throughout the Island from about 50 inches to 150 inches during the year.

Constitution.

The Constitution, which, after existing for nearly 200 years in Jamaica, was abrogated in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The abolition of this form of government, and the substitution for it of a new form, resulted from the serious disturbances amongst the black population which occurred in October, 1865.

After the suppression of disaffection in St. Thomas's-in-the-East, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created.

The Legislature unanimously responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

An Act of the Imperial Parliament and an Order in Council of the 9th April, 1866, were passed providing a new Constitution for Jamaica, which is that now in force, and is as follows:—

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of six official and six unofficial members. The official members to be the senior military officer, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, together with such other officers or persons as Her Majesty may think fit, and certain unofficial members not exceeding six in number.

There is also established a Privy Council.

The members of the Privy Council are, the Lieutenant-Governor, the senior military officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of Her Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum. The Governor is to consult in all cases with the Councillors, excepting only when the matter to be decided would in his judgment sustain material prejudice by consultation, or be too unimportant to require their advice; and he is to propose all questions on which they are to advise and decide; but any member may apply in writing for permission to propose a question, and a written answer, granting or refusing the request, is to be returned. The Governor is authorized to act in opposition to the advice and decision of the Privy Council, "if in any case it shall appear right so to do," and to report to the Secretary of State for the Colonies "the grounds and reasons" of his opposition, and any member may record on the minutes the nature of the advice or opinion offered and rejected.

With regard to the Legislative Council, the following rules and regulations are to be observed, in the transaction of business and in the passing of laws. The official members are to be the same as those mentioned for the Privy Council; the Governor is to appoint one or more persons to act provisionally as unofficial Councillor or Councillors, when the number appointed by her Majesty shall be less than six; and all the Councillors are to hold office during the Royal will and pleasure. Any member may propose questions for debate, excepting only that no law shall be enacted, nor any vote or resolution passed, nor any question admitted to debate, when the object is to dispose of or charge any part of the revenue, unless the proposition be made by the Governor, or the proposal expressly allowed or directed by him. All laws passed are to be styled, "Laws enacted by the Governor of Jamaica, with the advice of the Legislative Council thereof."

Jamaica under Crown Government.

For many years prior to the establishment of Crown Government, in 1866, the expenditure of the island exceeded the revenue by large amounts; but by the imposition of some additional taxation in 1867, the finances were placed on a sound
footing, and for several years large surpluses have been realised. Taxation per caput in Jamaica amounts to about 18s.

The number of parishes (which are the units of local government) has been reduced from 22 to 14. Each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., hospitals, almshouses, &c., &c., managed by the Municipal Board of the parish, of which the chairman is the custos. The custos is nominated by the governor, and the members of the Board are nominated by the custos, subject to the approval of the governor. There is also a Road Board in each parish, for the management of the parochial roads, appointed in the same way as the Municipal Board. The several taxes received on houses, horses, carriages, dogs, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected. The "general revenue" is collected by the officers of the Revenue Department, with a collector in each parish at the head of a branch office. The principal sums are derived from import duties, which yield about £50,000; excise duty on rum, at 6s. per gallon, yielding £50,000; and stamps, which bring in £5,000.

There is a regular postal service three times a-week to and from all parts of the island, by which letters are carried at 2d. per oz.

Government savings banks were established in 1871, in all the principal towns, and there is now deposited about £250,000, on which the Government pays interest at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum.

District courts, somewhat on the model of County Courts in England, are held all over the island. The judges are barristers or advocates.

The constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, semi-military. There are about 25 officers (inspector and sub-inspector) and 600 men distributed throughout the island.

An "island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, has been created. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "parochial medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons. For attending East Indian immigrants, vaccination, &c., &c., they are paid extra. They are not restricted in private practice, and at the same time are allowed all the privileges of pension, leave of absence, &c., which officers of the Service are entitled to.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica.

The Royal Mail steamers leave Southampton on the 2nd and 17th of each month. The average passage is 19 days. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. A French steamer leaves St. Nazaire once a month. Steamers of the Atlas line leave New York under mail contract every alternate Thursday. The average passage is seven days.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the cable touches at, whence it branches away via St. Thomas, Barbados, &c., to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama.

At present the only railway in Jamaica is that from Kingston via Spanish Town to Old Harbour, a distance of 26 miles.
