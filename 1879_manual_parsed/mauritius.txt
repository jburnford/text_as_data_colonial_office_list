MAURITIUS.

An island lying in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 17' and 57° 46' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat. It is 500 miles east of Madagascar. It comprises an area of 676 square miles.

The Mauritius was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507. They claimed possession of it during nearly the whole of the 16th century. The first who made any settlement in it were the Dutch in 1598, who named it Mauritius, in honour of their Prince Maurice. It was abandoned by them in 1710, and afterwards taken possession of by the French. Mauritius was for a long time during the war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels and Indiamen, from the facility with which sorties might be made from it upon our traders by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810. The possession of the island was ratified by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

Its greatest length from Cap Malheureux to Pointe Desnus is 39 miles, and its widest part 34 miles across.

It is situate at a distance of 115 miles from Réunion, 915 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar.

Mauritius is divided into seven districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.

Constitution.—Mauritius is a Crown colony, the government consisting of a Governor, who is aided in executive duties by an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council of Government consisting of certain public officers and unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

Dependencies.—The Island of Rodrigues, the Seychelles Islands, Diego Garcia, and others, are dependencies of the Mauritius. Rodrigues is situated about 300 miles east of Mauritius. It is 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth. It is cultivated by colonists from Mauritius.

The Seychelles, or Mahé Islands, are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the total number of acres comprised in this group is 50,120; the distance from Mauritius 940 miles. These islands are under the superintendence of a Chief Civil Commissioner (assisted by a Board of Commissioners) at Mahé, who is appointed by the Secretary of State, but is subordinate to the Governor of Mauritius, from whom he takes instructions.

Climate.—From December to April is the hottest season of the year, but it is comparatively cool during July, August, September, and October. The hurricane season extends from January to the middle of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 30° S. latitude. The longest days are at the December solstice, and the shortest at the June solstice. The difference of time between Greenwich and Port Louis is three hours, forty-nine minutes, fifty-eight seconds, the latter in advance of the former.

Railways.—There are two lines of railway, the worth Line and the Midland. The former runs between Port Louis and Mahebourg, and will this year be extended to Savanne; the distance between Port Louis and Mahebourg by rail is 35½ miles. At Curepipe the elevation is 1,822 feet above the sea. The North Line runs from Port Louis to Grand River, S.E., a distance of 30 miles. Telegraphic communication is established throughout the island.

Education.—The department of public instruction comprises two branches, the Royal College for higher education, and the Schools Department for primary education. The College is under control of a Rector, who is assisted by a staff of professors. The Schools Department is under the direction of a Superintendent aided by two Inspectors.

The Government schools are supported by the State; the grant schools only partially so. The following tabulation shows the numerical strength of each:

| Number | Pupils |
|--------|--------|
| Government schools | 48 | 7,216 |
| Grant schools | 43 | 4,569 |
| **Total** | **91** | **11,785** |

The annual vote amounts to about 17,000l.

There are nearly 200 masters and mistresses employed.

Of the 11,785 pupils 72 per cent. are professedly Roman Catholics, 6 per cent. belong to the Church of England, the Hindus number 15 per cent., creoles of European, African, or Chinese descent 76 per cent., and Indian 24.

Currency.—All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is also the currency of the island.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force in 1878.

Military Contribution.—Mauritius pays 45,000l. per annum to the Imperial Government as military contribution, but this amount is subject to reduction when the garrison is below the standard fixed upon as necessary for the defence of the colony; the sum paid in 1875 amounted to 20,289l.

Police.—The total police force is 681.

Sea Communications.—A monthly service is carried on by the mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes between Mauritius and Marseilles, via Suez touching at Réunion and Seychelles. The same Company's steamers leave Marseilles once a month (Sunday) for Mauritius. The passage to or back averages 26 days.

A line of sailing vessels has also been established between Mauritius and Natal, the passage occupying about 10 days.

* In 1851, the colonial and general mercantile shipping were returned together. The Census in 1851 was taken in November, when there are usually many Ships in Port; and that of 1861, in April, when the reverse is the case. These circumstances account for the apparent diminution in the shipping return notwithstanding the great increase in the commerce of the Island.
