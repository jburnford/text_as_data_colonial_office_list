LABUAN.

The island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of Borneo proper, about thirty miles.

The island was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846, and occupied in 1848.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, the development of which was undertaken by a Company which was formed in England at the time, under the name of "The Eastern Archipelago Company." Nevertheless, the coal resources of Labuan remain still comparatively undeveloped, and more than one Company has failed and retired from the undertaking.

"The Oriental Coal Company," which now hold a lease of the mines from the Crown, are a Scotch Company, having their offices in Leith. They entered upon the occupation of the mines in May, 1868, engaging to pay an annual rental to the Crown of £1,000.

Labuan has a fine port, and is a market for some of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo, and the Sulu Archipelago, as beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, india-rubber, pearls, tortoise-shell, and trepang, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore.

There are three sago manufactories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is

converted into sago flour, which is likewise forwarded for the Singapore market.

The Government is administered by a Governor and a nominated Legislative Council.

Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant in aid, but since then the colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony.
