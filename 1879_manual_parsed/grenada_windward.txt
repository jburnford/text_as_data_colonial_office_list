GRENADA.

Grenada is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 76,598 acres, with a population, by the Census of 1871, of 37,795 souls. It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and between it and the latter island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, partly attached to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 3,071 souls.

The country is mountainous and very picturesque, and abounds in streams and mineral springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, 7 miles from St. George, and Lake Antoine are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. The chief productions of Grenada are sugar and cotton, and those of Carriacou are cotton, ground provisions and live-stock.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was named Ascension. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the Colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. Major-General Edward Mathew was appointed Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Grenada and of Carriacou, and from that date to this time the government of Grenada has been confined within these limits. In 1787 St. George's was made a free port.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation.

In 1854 an Act was passed regulating the election of members of Assembly. The House of Assembly was to consist of 26 members, of whom 4 were returned for the town of St. George, 7 by the united parishes of St. George and St. John, 6 by the united parishes of St. Andrew and St. David, and 8 by Carriacou.

The Assembly was elected for seven years.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members selected by the Crown from the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. During the continuance of this Act the executive functions of the Legislative Council ceased, and were exercised by the new Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members receive each a salary of 100l. a-year, and are charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vic., c. 47) which has been mentioned in the previous article (St. Vincent), empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council has been established by the Queen, consisting of the Governor for the time being, and such persons, not fewer than three, as Her Majesty may designate by instructions or warrant. The persons already nominated are the persons acting as Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, and Treasurer.
