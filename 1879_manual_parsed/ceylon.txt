CEYLON.

An island situated in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindostan; lying between 5° 55' and 9° 51' N. lat., and 79° 41' and 81° 54' E. long.: its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondera Head, is 266 miles; its greatest width 140½ miles, from Colombo on the west coast, to Sangamankande on the east.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindostan. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,465 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°; and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,400 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795–6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island. They were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the Kan-dyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

By letters patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Queen's Advocate, the Treasurer, and the Auditor-General; and a Legislative Council of 15 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and six unofficial members.

In the Legislative Council no vote or resolution can be passed, and no question be admitted to debate, when the object of such ordinance or resolu-
tion, or question is to dispose of or charge any part of the revenue of the Island, unless the Governor shall have first proposed such vote.

Rs.1,240,000 per annum is paid to the Imperial Government as a Military Contribution.

The population of Ceylon was ascertained by the Census taken in 1871 to be 2,401,066, exclusive of military and shipping, the total being made up as follows:

- British, 2,703;
- Burghers, 5,771;
- Eurasians, 3,431;
- Moors, 584,339;
- Sinhalese, 1,669,998;
- Tamils, 584,339; others, 21,308.

The number of Indian coolies on coffee estates was estimated at 115,092, but the number employed at present is probably over 250,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice.

The area of the Island is 24,702 square miles, or 15,809,280 acres; and rather more than one-sixth of this, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation, the most important productions being:

- Rice, 700,000 acres; other Grain, roughly estimated at about 100,000 acres; Coffee, 290,000 acres; Tea, 3,000 acres; Cinchona, 7,000 acres; Cocoanuts, 260,000 acres; Cinnamon, 26,000 acres; Tobacco, 19,000 acres; Areka, Palmyrah, and other Palms, 60,000 acres.

The upset price of Crown land is ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs duties, land sales, a tax on the production of Grain (usually one-tenth), Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts.

The statement of revenue for 1877 shows the following amounts under these heads:

- Imports (there is no duty on exports), 3,351,787 rupees;
- Land Sales, 1,550,983;
- Grain Tax, &c., 1,084,586;
- Licences, 2,194,997;
- Salt, 840,749;
- Stamps, 1,332,205;
- Railway Receipts, 3,616,404—against which should be set off Contribution to Sinking Fund and Interest on Debentures, 618,026 rupees, and Working Expenses, &c., 972,157 rupees.

The grand total—17,026,191 rupees—is exclusive of the local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, and by the Provincial Road Committees.

The imports were valued at 62,783,676 rupees, of which 8,121,272 rupees is represented by specie, and the exports (deducting specie, 267,043 rupees) at 60,653,497 rupees, of which 59,916,124 rupees is returned for Ceylon produce, and 3,937,372 rupees for imports exported. Coffee to the value of 49,760,228 rupees, or about four-fifths of the total exports, passed through the Customs; the bulk of it, to the value of 42,066,376 rupees, being shipped to England. The aggregate tonnage of the shipping entered inwards and cleared outwards during the year was 1,296,987 and 1,205,657 tons, respectively. A large increase may be expected when the Breakwater at Colombo, already commenced, has been finished.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into seven Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who protect the rights of the Crown and promote the welfare of the people, and, with their Assistants and subordinate Headmen, are the channel of communication between the Government and the natives.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and

Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases not cognizable by the Courts of Requests. In addition to these there are the Gansabawas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 26 of 1871, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the necessary upkeep and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars at the end of 1876 in Government schools was 15,677, and in schools aided and inspected by Government was 63,786, and the cost 397,118 rupees, as compared with 1868, when the number was 6,879, and the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The principal towns are connected by the telegraph. There is a railway from Colombo to Kandy (74 miles) and a branch line of 17 miles into the coffee districts. Southwards, the railway is being extended to Kalutara (25 miles); 17 miles of this line are already open for traffic. Of metalled roads, there are 1,038 miles, of gravelled and natural roads, 723 and 718 miles. This is exclusive of roads within Municipal limits and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. The cost of construction is great, and the expenses of upkeep enormous, owing to climatic influences and the inferior quality of the metal available. The upkeep of a mile of metalled road costs, on an average over 600 rupees per annum, and it has exceeded 3,000 rupees where the traffic has been very heavy. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation; but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable, as compared with the outlay. The total expenditure on public works (not including the railway) in 1877 was 5,058,011 rupees; the cost of the establishment being 405,591 rupees, or about 8 per cent, on the outlay on works.

The daily average number of criminals in jail during the year 1877 was 2,353, of whom 47, or about 2·39 per cent., were women. The strength of the Police was 1,547; and the cost, 500,966 rupees.

A fortnightly mail service is carried on by the steamers of the P. and O. Company between Ceylon and Brindisi, Venice, Southampton, and intermediate ports and Bombay on one side, and Madras, Calcutta, Straits, and China on the other; also a monthly service between Ceylon and Australia. There is also a fortnightly mail service by the steamers of the M. M. Company between Ceylon and Marseilles, and between Ceylon and Calcutta, Straits and China. The passage to
Southampton generally occupies about 30 days, to Brindisi or Marseilles 23 or 24 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 6, 7, and 15 days respectively.

Further facilities are afforded by the British India Steam Navigation Company for communication with ports in India. These steamers leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports.
