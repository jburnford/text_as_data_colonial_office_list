### NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of three small islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 2' S. lat. and 167° 58' E. long., the other islands being Philip and Nepean Islands. They compose altogether about 15 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there. This was removed in 1836, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 194 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The Pitcairn Islanders were the descendants of the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," who occupied Pitcairn in 1789 and were removed at their own request to Norfolk Island. Of these 40 returned to Pitcairn. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population at the census of 1907 was males 363, females 396, Melanesians, males 157, females 24, total 940. The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The island has now been placed under the government of New South Wales. The office of the Administration is at the Chief Secretary's Department, Sydney—Deputy Administrator, W. Houston, C.M.G.; J.P., Officer-in-charge, M.V. Murphy. It is a station of the Pacific Cable Board. Communication with the group is maintained once a month by...
steamer from Sydney. There is a resident doctor. Education is free and there is an efficient school which has recently been placed under the control of the Department of Public Instruction, N.S.W. James Jacobs, B.A., is the head master. The chief village is Kingston, on the largest island.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.
Latitude, 31° 30' S. Longitude, 159° 5' E.

This island lies 436 miles north-east from Sydney, and 300 miles from Port Macquarie, the nearest part of the Australian continent.

It was discovered on February 14th, 1788, by Lieutenant H. L. Ball, of H.M.S. "Supply," while on his way from Port Jackson to found a settlement at Norfolk Island. It is of volcanic origin and crescent shaped, about seven miles in length and from one-half to one-and-three-quarters in width, containing about 3,220 acres. It is of great beauty throughout and covered with a dense and most luxuriant vegetation, but from the peculiar bouldery character of the formation of the major part of its floor, it has scarcely more than 300 acres suitable for agriculture. The soil of these few acres is extremely rich, and will produce almost any sub-tropical vegetation.

It was first occupied by a small party consisting of three men, accompanied by Maori women and two Maori boys, who were taken there by the whaling barque "Caroline," in 1833 or 1834. These were afterwards bought out by Messrs. Dawson and Poole, two gentlemen from Sydney, who founded a small colony there.

No lands have been sold, and the people pay no rent, occupying the land upon sufferance only—the Government reserving the right of resuming whenever they may see fit.

Since 1882 the island has been placed under a visiting magistrate, for the purpose of supervising the affairs of the island, and adjusting matters between the residents. The present visiting magistrate is Mr. Frank Farnell, J.P., who visits four times annually, the duties being carried out in an honorary capacity. The population in December, 1907, was 101. Very fair and comfortable accommodation can be obtained amongst the settlers. The natural beauties of the island render it most attractive to visitors. Fish are very plentiful, and good sport can consequently be had. A monthly steam service is in existence, instituted by Burns, Philp and Co., under contract to the Government. The principal product is the seeds of the Kentia palms, of which thousands of bushels are shipped annually to all parts of the world.

QUEENSLAND

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40' Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Welleseley, and other islands, are included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coastline to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 670,500 square miles, or 429,120,000 acre (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770 but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°, the latter, however, very rarely occurring. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from November to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, number of which are navigable for good-size vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the

**NORFOLK ISLAND.**

Norfolk Island is the principal of three small islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 2' S. lat. and 167° 58' E. long., the other islets being Philip and Nepean Islands. They comprise altogether about 15 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there. This was removed in 1856, and in 1866 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 134 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The Pitcairn Islanders were the descendants of the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," who occupied Pitcairn in 1789, and were removed at their own request to Norfolk Island. Of these 40 returned to Pitcairn. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population at the census of 1907 was males 363, females 396. Melanesians, males 157, females 24, total 940. The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The island has now been placed under the government of New South Wales. The office of the Administration is at the Chief Secretary's Department, Sydney—Deputy Administrator, W. Houston, C.M.G., J.P., Officer-in-charge, M.V. Murphy. It is a station of the Pacific Cable Board. Communication with the group is maintained once a month by...
steamer from Sydney. There is a resident doctor. Education is free and there is an efficient school which has recently been placed under the control of the Department of Public Instruction, N.S.W. James Jacobs, B.A., is the head master. The chief village is Kingston, on the largest island.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.

Latitude, 31° 30' S. Longitude, 159° 5' E.

This island lies 436 miles north-east from Sydney, and 300 miles from Port Macquarie, the nearest part of the Australian continent.

It was discovered on February 14th, 1788, by Lieutenant H. L. Ball, of H.M.S. "Supply," while on his way from Port Jackson to found a settlement at Norfolk Island. It is of volcanic origin and crescent shaped, about seven miles in length and from one-half to one-and-three-quarters in width, containing about 3,220 acres. It is of great beauty throughout and covered with a dense and most luxuriant vegetation, but from the peculiar bouldery character of the formation of the major part of its floor, it has scarcely more than 300 acres suitable for agriculture. The soil of these few acres is extremely rich, and will produce almost any sub-tropical vegetation.

It was first occupied by a small party consisting of three men, accompanied by Maori women and two Maori boys, who were taken there by the whaling barque "Caroline," in 1833 or 1834. These were afterwards bought out by Messrs. Dawson and Poole, two gentlemen from Sydney, who founded a small colony there.

No lands have been sold, and the people pay no rent, occupying the land upon sufferance only—the Government reserving the right of resuming whenever they may see fit.

Since 1882 the island has been placed under a visiting magistrate, for the purpose of supervising the affairs of the island, and adjusting matters between the residents. The present visiting magistrate is Mr. Frank Farnell, J.P., who visits four times annually, the duties being carried out in an honorary capacity. The population in December, 1907, was 101. Very fair and comfortable accommodation can be obtained amongst the settlers. The natural beauties of the island render it most attractive to visitors. Fish are very plentiful, and good sport can consequently be had. A monthly steam service is in existence, instituted by Burns, Philp and Co., under contract to the Government. The principal product is the seeds of the Kentia palms, of which thousands of bushels are shipped annually to all parts of the world.

QUEENSLAND

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coastline to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 70 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 670,500 square miles, or 429,120,000 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and after explorations by Leichhardt, in 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°, the latter, however, very rarely occurring. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from November to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera, of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the
country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

The year 1902 witnessed the culmination of an unprecedented period of drought, to which must be attributed the reduced output of many primary products about that period.

Sugar growing has become a very important industry. In 1907 there were 126,810 acres under cane, of which 94,384 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 1,635,028 tons of cane, which produced 188,907 tons of sugar at 94% net titre.

Maize was grown on 127,119 acres, and returned a yield of 3,053,789 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1907, 459 acres yielded 2,442 cwts. of cured leaf.

In 1907 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 270 acres, which yielded 3,013 tons of tuber, and 497,891 lbs. of manufactured arrowroot were made from a portion of this at the factories. A small proportion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. In 1907, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 2,084 acres were mown for hay, and 82,461 acres yielded 693,527 bushels of grain, 22,951 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,190 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 192,346,480 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 3,232,332 acres are leased as grazing farms and homesteads.

The chief exports were: Wool, valued at £1,421,778; gold, £2,013,288; sugar, £1,779,974; live stock, £1,265,750; tin, £46,732; silver, £6,767; meat £89,560; meat extract, £16,133; hides and skins, £18,448; tallow, £235,824; green fruit, £140,817; copper, £1,171,612; butter, £63,382.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important in the State, and gives employment to over 30,000 men. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mount Morgan mine—Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in over twenty-eight districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total production of gold during 1907 amounted to 465,882 fine ozs. The Herberton district is the head-quarters of the silver, 59,716l. out of a total of 112,540l., tin, 394,242l. out of a total of 496,766l., and copper, 314,347l. out of a total of 1,028,179l., mining industries, but the districts of Cooktown, tin, 19,614l., Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, tin, 32,784l., silver, 19,241l., copper, 14,960l., Hodgkinson, wolfram, 64,356l., Gladstone, copper, 43,622l., Cloncurry, copper, 57,944l., and Mount Perry, copper, 169,678l., silver, 12,913l., also contribute largely to the output of the baser metals, amongst which also should be mentioned bismuth, wolfram (89,767l.), and lead, 75,330l. Copper to the value of 1,028,179l., and tin 496,766l., were raised during the year. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1907 being of the value of 3,000l., whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area. At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems to the value of 40,500l. were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burrun and Peak Downs, whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1907 was 683,272 tons, valued at £222,135l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is popularly divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, crows ash, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay Bean tree, pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus has come largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1907, 295 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 25,120.
Water Supply.

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State, of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1907 an indebtedness to the Government of £7.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 670,500 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 934 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from a maximum of 5,045 feet, the depth of the bore at Bimerah Run; 504 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 375,000,000 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 245 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 96° to 70° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at nearly three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000£, so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the colony, and about 9,612 acres are artificially watered. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but vegetables, fruit, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51.2% per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population to be 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,919 females. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. The figures for 1901 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions.

| Census, 31st March, 1901. | M. | F. | P. |
|---------------------------|----|----|----|
| Total                     | 280,002 | 223,174 | 503,266 |
| Chinese                   | 8,783 | 539 | 9,313 |
| Polynesians               | 8,636 | 671 | 9,307 |
| Other Asiatics           | 4,599 | 396 | 4,995 |
| Aborigines living in civilisation | 3,802 | 2,808 | 6,610 |

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 35 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 231,861, the receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1907 were 652,425£; their expenditure 645,174£; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control 44,918,709£; and debt 1,944,517£. Debts for water works, amounting to 836,160£, which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, on the 31st December, 1907, an estimated population of 135,655 (ten-mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy, and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (15,506), Ipswich (15,246), Maryborough (12,900), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (19,691), Gympie (14,431), and Toowoomba (14,087), Charters Towers (20,976). All these include an area of five-mile radius. (Census 1901.)

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1907, 11 banks, with 216 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as 2,257,713£; deposits, 15,120,072£. The Government Savings Bank with 198 branches return the number of depositors as 97,995; the amount of deposits as 4,790,626£.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

On the 31st December, 1907, the railways in Queensland showed 3,197 miles in operation, to which has since been added some 162 miles, the cost of construction of opened lines being 22,002,485£, the revenue 1,949,240£, and the working expenses 956,129£. The following lines are now open for traffic:

The Southern and Western from Brisbane to Cunnamulla; with its branches (1,869 miles), Ipswich to Dungandan, North Ipswich to Tivoli, Wulkuraka to Kannangur, Dalby to Bell, Gowrie Junction; via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crow's Nest, Wyreema to Pittsworth, Hendon to Allora, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney, and Warwick to Goondiwindi. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to The Tweed, connecting with the Southern and Western line by a loop to Corinda, with branches to Beaudesert, Southport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Rockhampton, with branches to New Farm, Enoggera, Pinkenba, Sandgate, Kingaroy, Pialba, Cordalba, Gayndah and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre.

The Central Railway is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches (662 miles) Jericho to Blaidau, Mount Morgan, Springsure and Clermont; also one to Broadmount and to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 42 miles of railway are open to Finch Hatton, with branches to Eton and Langdon opening up good agricultural land.

The Bowen Railway is also open from that port to Bohababa, a distance of 48 miles.

The Northern Railway is open from Townsville to Winton, with branches (465 miles) to Ravenswood and Richmond, thence to Cloncurry.
