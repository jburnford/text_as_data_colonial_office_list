SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vict., c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, has also been annexed to South Australia, and is known as the Northern Territory. The whole State covers twenty-seven degrees of latitude, and twelve degrees of longitude, and includes an area of 903,690 square miles (equal to twice France and Germany together).

Kangaroo Island (90 m. by 25 m.; area 1,500 sq. m., 1,000 ft. highest point), Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands, near Port Darwin, and Groote Eylandt, the Pellew Archipelago, and others in the Gulf of Carpentaria, are included in the State.

Adelaide, the capital of the State, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

History.

The south coast of the State was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Stuart in 1829 discovered the Murray River and its upper tributaries. The South Australian Company, upon Wakefield's principles, was formed in England in 1834, under the Act mentioned above, and the first settlements were formed at Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in 1836. Copper was discovered 1842, by Menge. Responsible government was established in 1856. Stuart reached Port Darwin 1861, and the "Northern Territory" was added to the State in 1861 and 1863.

Climate.

The rainfall at Adelaide averages 21 inches annually, mostly from May to October. It varies from 16 to 42 inches on the plains and hills respectively. The mean temperature 74°, the extreme range being from 35° to 112°.

General Government.

The Parliament of South Australia consists of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, created by the Local Act No. 2 of 1855-56, which was proclaimed on October 25th, 1856. This Act, commonly called the Constitution Act, was passed by virtue of the Imperial Act 13 & 14 Vict., cap. 59. The Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as originally constituted, consisted of 18 and 36 members respectively. By the Local Act No. 27 of 1875, the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881, six members were added
powers are conferred by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1894. The governing body consists of Mayor, Aldermen (Aldermen are at present teachers, and 60,061 scholars.

The expenses of the Education Department for payment of teachers, &c., were, during 1907-8,
steamer from Sydney. There is a resident doctor. Education is free and there is an efficient school which has recently been placed under the control of the Department of Public Instruction, N.S.W. James Jacobs, B.A., is the head master. The chief village is Kingston, on the largest island.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.

Latitude, 31° 30' S. Longitude, 159° 5' E.

This island lies 436 miles north-east from Sydney, and 300 miles from Port Macquarie, the nearest part of the Australian continent.

It was discovered on February 14th, 1788, by Lieutenant H. L. Ball, of H.M.S. "Supply," while on his way from Port Jackson to found a settlement at Norfolk Island. It is of volcanic origin and crescent shaped, about seven miles in length and from one-half to one-and-three-quarters in width, containing about 3,220 acres. It is of great beauty throughout and covered with a dense and most luxuriant vegetation, but from the peculiar bouldery character of the formation of the major part of its floor, it has scarcely more than 300 acres suitable for agriculture. The soil of these few acres is extremely rich, and will produce almost any sub-tropical vegetation.

It was first occupied by a small party consisting of three men, accompanied by Maori women and two Maori boys, who were taken there by the whaling barque "Caroline," in 1833 or 1834. These were afterwards bought out by Messrs. Dawson and Poole, two gentlemen from Sydney, who founded a small colony there.

No lands have been sold, and the people pay no rent, occupying the land upon sufferance only—the Government reserving the right of resuming whenever they may see fit.

Since 1882 the island has been placed under a visiting magistrate, for the purpose of supervising the affairs of the island, and adjusting matters between the residents. The present visiting magistrate is Mr. Frank Farnell, J.P., who visits four times annually, the duties being carried out in an honorary capacity. The population in December, 1907, was 101. Very fair and comfortable accommodation can be obtained amongst the settlers. The natural beauties of the island render it most attractive to visitors. Fish are very plentiful, and good sport can consequently be had. A monthly steam service is in existence, instituted by Burns, Philp and Co., under contract to the Government. The principal product is the seeds of the Kentia palms, of which thousands of bushels are shipped annually to all parts of the world.

QUEENSLAND

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coastline to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 1,000 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 670,500 square miles, or 429,120,000 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, when the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, and the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°, the latter, however, very rarely occurring. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from November to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the
country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweetpotato, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

The year 1902 witnessed the culmination of an unprecedented period of drought, to which must be attributed the reduced output of many primary products about that period.

Sugar growing has become a very important industry. In 1907 there were 126,810 acres under cane, of which 94,384 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 1,665,028 tons of cane, which produced 188,307 tons of sugar at 94% net titre.

Maize was grown on 127,119 acres, and returned a yield of 3,093,789 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1907, 459 acres yielded 2,442 cwt.s of cured leaf.

In 1907 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 276 acres, which yielded 3,013 tons of tuber, and 497,891 lbs. of manufactured arrowroot were made from a portion of this at the factories. A small proportion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. In 1907, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 2,084 acres were mown for hay, and 82,461 acres yielded 693,527 bushels of grain, 22,951 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is in far advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,190 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 192,346,480 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 38,532,332 acres are leased as grazing farms and homesteads.

The chief exports were: Wool, valued at £1,424,778.; gold, 2,013,238.; sugar, 1,779,974.; live stock, 1,265,750.; tin, 446,732.; silver, 96,767.; meat 859,560.; meat extract, 16,133.; hides and skins, 518,448.; tallow, 235,824.; green fruit, 140,817.; copper, 1,171,612.; butter, 503,582.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important in the State, and gives employment to over 30,000 men. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mount Morgan mine—Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in over twenty-eight districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total production of gold during 1907 amounted to 465,882 fine ozs. The Herberton district is the head-quarters of the silver, 59,716l. out of a total of 112,540l., tin, 394,242l. out of a total of 496,760l., and copper, 314,347l. out of a total of 1,028,179l., mining industries, but the districts of Cooktown, tin, 19,614l., Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, tin, 32,784l., silver, 19,241l., copper, 14,960l., Hodgkinson, wolfram, 64,356l., Gladstone, copper, 43,622l., Cloncurry, copper, 57,944l., and Mount Perry, copper, 169,678l., silver, 12,913l., also contribute largely to the output of the baser metals, amongst which also should be mentioned bismuth, wolfram (89,767l.), and lead, 75,330l. Copper to the value of 1,028,179l., and tin 496,760l., were raised during the year. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1907 being of the value of 3,000l., whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area. At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems to the value of 40,500l. were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burrun and Peak Downs, whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1907 was 683,272 tons, valued at 222,135l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is popularly divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, crows ash, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay Bean tree, pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus has come largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1907, 295 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 25,129.
Water Supply.

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State, of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1907 an indebtedness to the Government of £7.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 670,500 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 934 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from a maximum of 5,045 feet, the depth of the bore at Bimereh Run: 564 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 375,000,000 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 245 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 106° to 70° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at nearly three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000£, so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the colony, and about 9,612 acres are artificially watered. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but vegetables, fruit, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51,209 per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population to be 393,718; of these 223,739 were males, and 169,939 females. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. The figures for 1901 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions.

Census, 31st March, 1901.

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 35 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 231,861.

The receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1907 were 652,425£; their expenditure 645,174£; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control 44,918,709£, and debt 1,944,517£. Debts for water works, amounting to 836,160£, which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, on the 31st December, 1907, an estimated population of 135,655 (ten-mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy, and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (15,506), Ipswich (15,246), Maryborough (12,900), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (19,691), Gympie (14,431), and Toowoomba (14,987), Charters Towers (20,976). All these include an area of five-mile radius. (Census 1901.)

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1907, 11 banks, with 216 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as 2,257,713£; deposits 15,120,472£. The Government Savings Bank with 198 branches return the number of depositors as 97,995; the amount of deposits as 4,790,629£.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

On the 31st December, 1907, the railways in Queensland showed 3,197 miles in operation, to which has since been added some 162 miles, the cost of construction of opened lines being 22,092,485£, the revenue 1,949,240£, and the working expenses 956,129£. The following lines are now open for traffic:

- **The Southern and Western** from Brisbane to Camamulla; with its branches (1,869 miles) Ipswich to Dugandan, North Ipswich to Tivoli, Wulkuraka to Kannangur, Dalby to Bell, Gowrie Junction via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crow's Nest, Wavreema to Pittsworth, Hendon to Allora, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney, and Warwick to Goondiwindi. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to The Tweed, connecting with the Southern and Western line by a loop to Corinda, with branches to Beaudesert, Southport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Rockhampton, with branches to New Farm, Enoggera, Pinkenba, Sandgate, Kingaroy, Palba, Cordalba, Gayndah, and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre.

- **The Central Railway** is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches (662 miles) Jericho to Bladau, Mount Morgan, Springsure and Clermont; also one to Broadmount and to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 42 miles of railway are open to Finch Hatton, with branches to Eton and Langdon opening up good agricultural land.

- **The Bowen Railway** is also open from that port to Bobawaba, a distance of 48 miles.

- **The Northern Railway** is open from Townsville to Winton, with branches (465 miles) to Ravenswood and Richmond, thence to Cloncurry.
(174 miles) having been carried through Charters Towers, the latter town, a great gold-mining centre, having a population of 20,976 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the sites of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook District a railway is constructed intended ultimately to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 68 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also constructed from Cairns, 69 miles on the sea coast, to Mareeba, with a branch to Atherton, connecting with the private line to Chillagoe and Mungana, 103 miles, with a branch to Mount Garnet, tapping a large area rich in minerals. There is also a line from Cairns to Harvey's Creek, 31 miles. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croalton, 96 miles, south-easterly.

There is also a steam tramway line from Townsville to Ayr, a distance of 44 miles.

There are 556 electric telegraph stations in the State. The number of miles of line 10,253, with 21,000 miles of wire. The receipts of the Post and Telegraph Department were £48,306.

The number of messages during 1907 was 2,119,674. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 4,820 subscribers who use it, and 31 Telephone Exchanges and cables containing multiple wires have been laid underground to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street, and to secure a metallic circuit, and the Revenue amounted to £42,877.

Communication with London is maintained, via Suez every week; via San Francisco and Sydney every three weeks; via Vancouver every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi is thirty-four days. There is daily communication with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, per ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Within a town      | 1d.       |
| Australasia        | 2d.       |
| United Kingdom and Postal Union Countries | 2d. | 1d. per 4 oz. |

A Parcel Post with England is in operation.

**Education.**

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict. No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1907 there were in operation 1,089 schools with an enrolment of 105,382 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 163 private schools, with 14,341 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 1,044 pupils on the roll.

A University is about to be established. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

**Immigration.**

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 61,927, and the departures to all countries 57,504, showing an excess of arrivals of 4,423. The arrivals of Chinese numbered 482, and of Pacific Islanders 350, whilst the departures of these coloured aliens numbered 784 and 3,278, and their deaths 82 and 63 respectively.

By Act 53 Vict., No. 2, the number of Chinese to be landed by any one ship is limited to the proportion of one to every five hundred tons of the tonnage of such ship.

**Government.**

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The Elections Act Amendment Act of 1905 provides for male and female adult franchise on residential qualification only, a twelve months' continuous residence in the State being the only proviso, subject to disqualifications for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc. Owners of freeholds and leaseholds of a certain value possessing a residential qualification in another electorate can elect to be registered for the former in lieu of that within which they reside, but no persons can be enrolled for more than one electorate.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 44 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act, No. 10 of 1887, as amended by the Electoral Districts Act of 1892, the State is divided into 61 districts, of which 11 return two members, and 50 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.

Situation and Area.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 90, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vict., c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, has also been annexed to South Australia, and is known as the Northern Territory. The whole State covers twenty-seven degrees of latitude, and twelve degrees of longitude, and includes an area of 903,690 square miles (equal to twice France and Germany together).

Kangaroo Island (90 m. by 25 m.; area 1,500 sq. m., 1,000 ft. highest point), Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands, near Port Darwin, and Groote Eylandt, the Pellew Archipelago, and others in the Gulf of Carpentaria, are included in the State.

Adelaide, the capital of the State, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

History.

The south coast of the State was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Stuart in 1829 discovered the Murray River and its upper tributaries. The South Australian Company, upon Wakefield's principles, was formed in England in 1834, under the Act mentioned above, and the first settlements were formed at Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in 1836. Copper was discovered 1842, by Menge. Responsible government was established in 1856. Stuart reached Port Darwin 1861, and the "Northern Territory" was added to the State in 1861 and 1863.

Climate.

The rainfall at Adelaide averages 21 inches annually, mostly from May to October. It varies from 16 to 42 inches on the plains and hills respectively. The mean temperature 74°, the extreme range being from 35° to 112°.

General Government.

The Parliament of South Australia consists of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, created by the Local Act No. 2 of 1855-56, which was proclaimed on October 25th, 1856. This Act, commonly called the Constitution Act, was passed by virtue of the Imperial Act 13 & 14 Vict., cap. 59.

The Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as originally constituted, consisted of 18 and 36 members respectively. By the Local Act No. 27 of 1875, the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881, six members were added.
of 1849, the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881, six members were added
to the Legislative Council, and the Colony was divided into four electoral districts for the purpose of Council elections. In 1882 the House of Assembly was further increased to 52 members, representing 26 electoral districts; and by Act No. 450 of 1888, the Northern Territory was created an electoral district, returning two members, thus raising the number to 54. By Act 779 of 1901, the number of members was reduced from 31st March, 1902, to 18 in the Legislative Council and 42 (representing 13 districts) in the House of Assembly.

The four electoral districts of the Legislative Council are—Central, Southern, North-eastern, and Northern, the first returning six members and the others four members each. On May 3rd, 1895, and every three years thereafter, three members for the Central District and two members for each of the other Council Districts who stand first on the roll retire, and their successors will be appointed by each of the four districts electing members. The new members are placed at the bottom of the roll of their district, the member receiving most votes at the election being placed last. Elections are conducted by ballot. Act No. 779 of 1901 provides for a penal dissolution of the Council, or the calling up of additional members, if the Council twice reject a Bill which has been twice passed by the House of Assembly, a general election having intervened. But the dissolution or the calling up of members is permissive, not compulsory; and if members are called up no vacancies may be filled while the total number of members is 18 or more.

The quorum of the Council consists of ten members, including the President.

The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the King, and that he has resided in the State for three years. The qualification of a voter is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have resided in South Australia six months. As to other qualifications, see Act 920, 1907. Members of both houses are paid £200 per annum.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; 9 Districts returning 3 members each, 2 Districts returning 4 members each, 1 District returning 5 members, and 1 District returning 2 members. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be qualified and entitled to be registered as an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, a natural born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have lived in South Australia for six months continuously. The total number of electors in 1907 for the Legislative Council is 35,482, of whom 14,698 were females, and for the House of Assembly 130,830, of which about 94,265 were women. The session is usually from June to December.

The franchise for both Houses was extended to adult women by Act 613 of 1894.

Responsible government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature, who form the Cabinet, and are ex-officio members of the Executive Council.

Local Government.

There are 32 municipalities in the State, whose powers are regulated by the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1890." The governing body consists of Mayor, Aldermen (Aldermen are at present elected for City of Adelaide and some of the Suburban Corporations only), and Councillors, elected by the ratepayers, who also elect the Auditors. The Council has power to levy rates for municipal purposes only on all house and land property within the municipal area, but the question of raising a loan must be submitted to a general meeting of the ratepayers, and a poll must be taken if demanded by six ratepayers. There are also 143 district councils having somewhat similar powers. The aggregate assessment of the property within the municipal areas and District Councils amounts to 2,902,851l., and the revenue in 1907 amounted to 282,904l., and the expenditure to 282,826l.

Population.

The population of the State (including the northern territory) at the census of 1891, was 320,431 persons, and of 1901, 362,604. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are about 2,600. In 1906 there were about 2,562 Chinese in the State, of whom 2,332 were residents of the Northern Territory. The immigration of Chinese is controlled by the Commonwealth Government under the Immigration Restriction Act, No. 17 of 1901.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide, including the suburbs, on 31st December, 1907, were estimated to number 178,300.

About 80 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 26 per cent.

Education.

The University of Adelaide was founded by Royal Letters Patent in 1881, and an Act of the local Parliament in 1874. It was endowed by private munificence, aided by an annual grant of 5 per cent. on all sums contributed from private sources, and an endowment of land, the total amount of income being about 20,000l. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and music; the staff consists of 9 professors and 21 lecturers, and 10 teachers in the Conservatorium of Music. All classes are open to women. It had in 1907 388 undergraduates and 266 non-graduating students (exclusive of 336 students at the Conservatorium of Music), besides those attending extension lectures.

Total expenditure, 21,810l.

In connection with the Art Gallery 3 Schools of Design have been formed, in which 667 students are instructed in painting and designing for technical purposes.

The School of Mines and Industries was established in 1889. It is supported by an annual parliamentary vote of about 4,600l., and by school fees. Diplomas are awarded in mining, metallurgy, and mechanical engineering. The staff consists of 50 officers and teachers. The students number about 1,507.

Primary education is provided for by the Education Acts of 1875, 1878, and 1891, by which the management of public education is committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free from January 1, 1892, up to the compulsory standard, and it has been compulsory since 1876. There are 716 schools, with 1,389 teachers, and 60,061 scholars.

The expenses of the Education Department for payment of teachers, &c., were, during 1907-8,
The total expenditure on school buildings up to the end of 1907 was £534,097. The lands dedicated to educational purposes amount to 459,947 acres, and the land leased was 397,612 acres, at an annual rental of £6,214.

For the maintenance of the South Australian Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, also country institutes in 1907-8, the sum expended was £13,309.

The legal tribunals of the State consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, and Gladstone, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; and at Palmerston, Northern Territory, by the Judge of the Northern Territory; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court; Local Courts of Insolvency at Port Augusta, Gladstone, Mount Gambier, and Moonta, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; and at Palmerston, Northern Territory, by the Judge of the Northern Territory; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction in all the principal towns throughout the State with full Jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates, and Limited Jurisdiction, by Justices of the Peace; and Police Magistrates' Courts.

The number of convictions in the Supreme Court has averaged during the last three years 112, one in every 3,360 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community. The total value of the lands brought under the operation of this law to the end of 1907 amounts to £17,320,610 sterling.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes. The amount of the Public Debt outstanding (including Northern Territory) on June 30th, 1908, was £29,985,858.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

Seven banking institutions carry on business within the State, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland townships—numbering altogether 96 branches and agencies. Their names are: The Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Limited; National Bank of Australasia, Limited; English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Limited; Bank of Adelaide; Bank of New South Wales; and Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited. The total average liabilities of the seven banks amount to (December, 1906) £9,039,844, (including £313,563, perpetual inscribed stock), average note circulation £496,327, and the total average assets to £8,119,369.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 216 agencies. The number of depositors on 30th June, 1908, was 148,718 and the total deposits amounted to £5,803,301. Average to credit of depositor, 39/-. 0s. 5d. Rate interest paid to depositors, 3l. 5s. 0d. per cent. 42 in every 100 persons of the population are depositors in savings banks.

Industry.

It may be roughly estimated that not more than 150,000 square miles of the area of the State excluding the Northern Territory, are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 300 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached 1,200 miles. Forty-six counties have been proclaimed to 31st December, 1907, embracing 80,453 square miles, or 51,489,920 acres. The area outside the declared counties covers 289,617 square miles, or 191,754,880 acres. Of this large area only 8,316,059 acres have been alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to upwards of 88 acres for each male adult in the State, 98,522,100 acres being held under lease from the Crown. 1,134,424 acres are in process of alienation under systems of deferred payments. About one in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to leasing, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 20,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, &c.

More than one-half the total area of land cultivated (3,368,385 acres) is cropped with wheat, of which 1,753,753 acres were cultivated in 1907.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry; 21,080 acres of land were devoted to this purpose in 1907. Wine made, 2,061,987 gals. Exported, 737,664 gals. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants; of the former 24,488 cwt., and of the latter, 19,957 cwt., were made in 1907.

Almond trees (218,417) are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment. Orange trees, 167,937; lemon trees, 54,271; olive trees, 83,153.

The State possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive—16,954 gals. produced in 1907. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and general superiority over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a high position in the local market.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. In 1907 there were 124,044 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 208,639; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 334,671; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to over 6,829,638, whilst the exports of
wool have increased from 4,000 to 156,231 bales. The number of manufactories is 989, employing 20,306 hands and 17,815 horse-power.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, and there are now many steam flour mills, saw mills, foundries, agricultural implement works, breweries, &c. Several marble and slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened.

The gasworks of the State are seven in number, of which one is for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, and the remaining six are in the principal country towns. 315 vessels, of 59,822 tons, were, in 1907, registered at Port Adelaide.

Out of 8,802,639l. worth of staple produce exported, the value of breadstuffs amounted to 2,374,864l.; while wool represented 2,100,067l., and copper and copper ore 820,216l., and 2,906,895l. other products and manufactures.

The chief imports are textiles, sugar, alcohol, tea, coals, hardware, and machinery. The total external trade is 26,018,637l., far the larger part of which is with the United Kingdom and the Colonies, the bulk of the remainder being with the United States, France, Germany and Belgium. The chief copper mines are those at Moonta and Wallaroo; the chief gold fields, Arltunga, Angipena, Barossa, Blumberg, Echunga, Luxemburg, Mount Granger, Mount Pleasant, Mount Torrens, Nillinghoo, Tarcoola, Teetulpa, Ullooloo, Wadaminga, Woodside, and Waukaringa, and Burrundie MacDonnel Ranges in the N. T.

Means of Communication.

There are 4,520 miles of roads defined in the settled districts, the greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed from the General Revenue—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 2,703. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

The railways purchased by Government are all constructed and worked by the Government. The mileage opened for traffic in the State is 1,879, and 146 miles in the Northern Territory. Up to June 30th, 1908, the total cost of the railways reached 13,858,699l. The receipts in 1907-8 were 1,741,259l., and the expenditure 969,530l. Working expenses 57'63 per cent. of the gross revenue, Net revenue on cost, 5'57 per cent. There is daily railway communication between Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane.

The geographical position of South Australia necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. To accomplish this South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of telegraph, some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over 500,000l., across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party. An additional wire has been erected at a cost of over 50,000l. At present the railway reaches Oodnadatta, 688 miles north of Adelaide, and Pine Creek, 146 miles south of Palmerston, the intervening gap being 1,200 miles.

At the close of the year 1907 there were 317 stations, 6,168 miles of telegraph line, and 22,981 miles of wire open throughout the State. There are 595 miles of telephone line open, 15 exchanges, 3,033 connections, and 7,198 miles of telephone wire. The number of messages sent in 1907 was 2,069,159, of which 236,964 were international.

Internal water communication is afforded by the Murray River, on which steamers run for 2,000 miles. There is regular and frequent communication by mail steamers with all parts of Australasia as well as with Europe and San Francisco. The rates of postage are:

| Letters. Newspapers. |
|----------------------|
| per ½ oz. each       |
| not exceeding 10 ozs. | 2d. ; every additional 10 ozs. ½d. |
| not exceeding 4 ozs. | 1½d. ; every additional 2 ozs. ½d. |

The total number of Post Offices, 716; letters and post cards sent and received in 1907, 24,643,888; packets, 6,338,593; newspapers, 6,346,097.

Cable rate, London to Adelaide and vice-versa, 3s. per word.
