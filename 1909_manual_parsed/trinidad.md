TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 48 miles, and its average breadth 35 miles, and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony includes the island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of Oct., 1898, it was provided that, on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, the island of Tobago should be a ward of the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony, and that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled. A proclamation was issued bringing these provisions into force from the 1st January, 1899.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago, by the census of 1901, was 255,148. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Germans, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 86,373. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of four members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted in 1898, and now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, the Inspector-General of Constabulary, the Director of Public Works, the Surgeon-General, the Protector of Immigrants, the Receiver-General, and the Collector of Customs, and of such other persons (unofficial members) as the Governor may appoint. The unofficial members hold their seats for five years, and are at present eleven in number.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company, Ltd., was formed and registered in 1906 to carry into effect an agreement under an Ordinance of the Legislative Council for the provision of a floating graving dock and workshops, and for the payment by the Government half-yearly, for 25 years, of a subsidy to supplement the net earnings of the Company for securing the payment to the Company of interest—at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum on the initial capital expenditure of £100,000. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 65 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the Company. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons, and the Concession provides, amongst other things, that the Company controlling it shall always remain British in character.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1907-8 were: Sugar, 925,406 cwts.; and cocoa, 444,023 cwts. Molasses, rum, bitters, coconuts, balata gum, fruit, timber, manjack and asphalt are also exported. In the near future it is expected that the mineral resources of the colony will become
of considerable importance. Two local companies are working marljack mines at Vistabella and Marabella, near San Fernando, and the Canadian Oil Exploration Company is engaged in developing the Guayaguayare Oil Fields in the south-eastern portion of the island. A syndicate has been formed and registered in London, under the name of the Trinidad Petroleum Company, Ltd., to work oil concessions in the south-western district of the island. A beginning has at last been made in the direction of the establishment of a fruit trade, and in 1905-6, 4,259£ worth of fruit was exported to the United Kingdom as a commencement of the industry, and in 1907-8, it had increased to 9,955£. The prospects of the banana and rubber cultivations, which have been taken up in recent years, are very encouraging.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about half a million sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the last 46 years, 1862 to 1907, was 72-39 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1907 was 78 Fahr., the maximum being 89-3 in October, and the minimum 66-8 in February, and the rainfall 70-04 inches.

The island is divided into eight counties.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1901, 54,100), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st March, 1907, 61 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 500 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

The borough of Port of Spain was placed on the 1st January, 1889, under the management of four Commissioners, styled "The Port of Spain Town Commissioners," but under an Ordinance passed on the 8th April, 1907, a "Town Board" took over the duties of the Commissioners in addition to those of the water and sewerage authorities. This Board, with Mr. Adam Smith as Chief Commissioner, consists of 12 members nominated by the Governor. At the end of two years the subject of the constitution of the Board will be reconsidered by the Legislative Council, and a fresh Ordinance passed.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1901 (census), 7,613), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1901 (census), 4,076). The total municipal revenue of the three boroughs in 1907-8 was £64,390/-, 17s. 2¾d., the expenditure £63,403/-, 4s. 8½d., and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was £29,000/-, on the 31st March, 1907.

A pitch lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of £10,000, and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease is for 21 years from 1st of January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of £4,000/- a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from the Pitch Lake in 1907-8 was £50,185/-.

Of the total area of the Colony, which is estimated at about 1,195,500 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of March, 1906, was estimated to be approximately 550,312 acres. About 312,000 acres are under cultivation; 569,688 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

The Gulf steamers connect with the railway at San Fernando and proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain. Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the railway. Under a contract between the Government and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company a bi-weekly service is maintained between Trinidad and Tobago, with regular communication between Port of Spain and all the principal ports of each island.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles) on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Prince's Town in 1884, and further extensions to Sangre Grande (12 miles) and Tabaquite (15 miles) were opened to traffic on 29th August, 1897, and 13th August, 1898, respectively. On the 2nd March, 1908, the Legislative Council passed a resolution approving the extension of the railway system from San Fernando to Siparia, a distance of 13½ miles, and from Tabaquite to Poole, a distance of 16 miles, which had been recommended by a Special Committee in 1906. The first extension, which will pass through cultivated lands throughout nearly its whole course, has been roughly estimated on the basis of the general cost of railway construction as hitherto carried out in the Colony, at £122,719/., and will serve a population of about 14,000 persons, with a cultivated area of over 14,100 acres. The second has been estimated at £77,280/., and will serve a population of about 6,500 persons, with a cultivated area of about 10,500 acres, which is, however, rapidly extending. The loan to be raised is estimated at £225,000/-. The preliminary surveys are now proceeding. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande. The total length of line open is about 81½ miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total receipts from the railways, tramways and telegraphs during 1907-8 were £102,624/., and the expenditure was £61,973/.. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund. The interest on 31st March, 1907, amounted to £22,624/.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and about 64 out-offices throughout the island.
There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada and Saint Croix, and thence via Canada or the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 85 miles, constructed by the Government.

The wireless telegraph system between Trinidad and Tobago, established in 1906, gave satisfactory results during the year 1907-8. The following number of messages passed:

| From Trinidad to Tobago | Private | Official |
|-------------------------|---------|----------|
|                         | 240     | 78       |
| Tobago to Trinidad      |         |          |
|                         | 245     | 64       |

Every opportunity to communicate with ships equipped with wireless apparatus was taken advantage of, and there were 13 such communications during the year from the Trinidad Station and 5 from the Tobago Station. H.M.S. "Scylla" communicated with Trinidad several times from Grenada and once from St. Vincent (200 miles distant), and with Tobago when she was 150 miles away.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 49-25 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides some few transient steamers:—Harrison Line, Leyland Line, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Navigazione Generale Italiana, Scrutton's Direct Line, Dutch Line, London Direct Line, Canadian, Pickford and Black's Canadian Line, Orinoco Line (Compania de Vapous de Orinoco), Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co., La Veloce, and the Royal Mail Line. The ocean steamers of the Royal Mail Company now call at Port of Spain both on the outward and homeward routes. It is worthy of note that the steamers of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique are, as a rule, of greater tonnage than the ocean boats of the Royal Mail, and find no difficulty in entering the port. A fortnightly service to New York is carried out by a local firm, and to Canada by Pickford and Black's Line, the latter service being subsidised. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers. The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

- Within Colony ... ... ... 1d.
- To U.K., India and certain Colonies* 1d.
- To other places ... ... ... 2½d.

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head 50,193/5s. 7¾d. was expended by the Government in 1907-8, in introducing 1,860 (Statute adults) immigrants. The numbers introduced in 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901-2, 1902-3, 1903-4, 1904-5, 1905-6, 1906-7, and 1907-8 respectively were 3,087, 1,860, 1,292, 1,750, 1,779, 2,475, 2,348, 2,458, 1,219, 3,604, 2,417, and 1,860.

752 Statute adults were returned to India on 26th October, 1907.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, and United States gold currency. These are all legal tender, but British gold is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public.

The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of 100,000L estimated. The Union Bank of Halifax also issues its own notes.

There is no Colonial coinage, but an Ordinance (No. 16.-1903), for the issue of Government 1 and 2 dollar currency Notes was passed on the 23rd December, 1903, and these Government currency notes are now in common use.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank and the Union Bank of Halifax have now branches in Port of Spain. Government savings banks are established in thirteen districts, with a head office in Port of Spain. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1907 was 329,215L 6s. 8½d. The total number of depositors was 15,796. They are under the management of a board, a chief manager of savings banks, and the local wardens.

Openings for the Investment of Capital.—Of the industries which offer inducements to investors of capital, in Trinidad and Tobago, the cultivation of cocoa is perhaps the most attractive, and profitable investments are to be secured either in

(a) the formation of an estate,
(b) the purchase of an established estate, or
(c) the investment of capital on the security of an established estate.

Sound investments for capital can usually be obtained for sums under £1,000 (208L 6s. 8½d.) at 10%: from £1,000 up to £6,000 (1,250L) at 8%; and over £6,000 at 6 or 7%.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), the Roman Catholic Institution, St. Mary's College, and Naparima College (Presbyterian)—the two latter being affiliated to the Royal College. Attached to these institutions are four exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of 150L, each tenable for four years, or 200L, tenable for three years, at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of March, 1908—200 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 230 on those of St. Mary's College, and 50 in the Naparima College.

The elementary schools are now 251 in number, 52 of which are secular schools, supported entirely by Government, and 199 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the practising schools and 2 assisted schools 5s. per month is charged. There are 2 Government and 3 denominational colleges for teachers, in which 44 students are trained. The Government schools in 1906-7 had 9,562 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 34,467.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for Girls. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 44,000, with an average daily attendance of 24,000. A High School for Girls was formed in Port of Spain during 1906. The teaching of practical agriculture now proves part of the daily routine in the majority of boys' and mixed schools throughout the Colony. 203 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1906-7.
