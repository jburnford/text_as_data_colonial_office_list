Increased Harbour Advantages

AT

PORT NATAL.

Improved facilities for Quick Despatch are now offered at this Port.

The Inner Harbour is accessible to vessels of Deep Draught by Night as well as by Day.

The Port Equipment includes Three Powerful Tugs, Hydraulic Cranes of a lifting capacity ranging from 30 cwt. to 50 tons, 20-ton Sheers, an extensive system of closed Sheds, furnished with hydraulic cranes and lighted by electricity, together with the usual appliances of an up-to-date Port.

A commodious Customs Railway Bond Shed, erected with special regard to the requirements of the Overberg Trade, is approaching completion.

The attention of Shipowners is directed to the recent addition to the Port Equipment of a Floating Graving Dock with a net lifting power of 8,500 tons, and a Floating Workshop of large dimensions.

Extensive Open Spaces are available on most advantageous terms for the Storage of Timber and Rough Imports. These spaces are constantly being added to by reclamation in connection with the extension of wharfage in pursuance of comprehensive plans of Harbour development.

The length of Wharves and Stone Quayage in present use is Two Miles, while additional sections aggregating an equal length are under construction.

The local mines furnish Coal of Good Quality, and every effort is being made to establish the character of the Port as a reliable and Cheap Coaling Station. Best coal is obtainable at 15s. 6d. alongside in Railway trucks.

The 13,000-ton Royal Mail Steamers of the Union-Castle Company's fleet now regularly land and embark their passengers at the Wharf, where the Through Journey to the Transvaal by Corridor Train may be commenced. The time occupied on this, the Shortest and Most Interesting Route to Johannesburg, is 24 hours.

The normal capacity of the Port (exclusive of coal) is 8,000 tons per diem.

THE AGENT-GENERAL FOR NATAL,

26, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W.
Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and the Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotse, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,754 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 45 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas: total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,931 square miles.

Zululand and Amotongaland.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Chaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Chaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingaan in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Panda. In the latter years of Panda Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Panda's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetywayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetywayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetywayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetywayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1851, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the

**Situation and Area.**

The Colony of Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange River Colony and Basutoland, and on the south by the Cape Colony and Umzimvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,371 square miles, and has a seaboard of 376 miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of about 32,000, exclusive of H.M.'s troops; the largest town and only port is Durban, with about 70,000 inhabitants, of whom about 19,000 are natives, about 2,000 mixed and others, and about 16,700 Indians and other Asiatics, and about 32,000 whites.

**History.**

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage endeavoured to colonise it. Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Chaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the Transvaal and Orange Free States on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other,

Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetywayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa.

The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetywayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inzvane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginhlovo on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetywayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetywayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Chaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetywayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatuzi River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatuzi and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetywayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutus, finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinuzulu, a son of Cetywayo, as king; but it was soon checked, and Dinuzulu and some of his indunas were removed to St. Helena, while others were imprisoned or fined. Dinuzulu and his two uncles Ndabuko and Ishingana were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1889.

In 1890 the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Umbegiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Amatongaland, also called Amapataland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongola with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The
boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Amatongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

In 1906 a serious native rebellion broke out in the colony and spread to Zululand. It was suppressed by the colonial forces, with assistance from detachments from the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. A Commission was appointed to enquire into the native question generally, and the Commission's Report has since been published.

In 1907 there was a further recrudescence of unrest amongst the natives in Zululand, which was, however, easily suppressed without actual bloodshed. Dinuzulu, son of Cetywayo, and other leading chiefs were arrested, and are to be tried on various charges of high treason and complicity in the murders of several noted loyalist chiefs. It is hoped that the disorder has been finally allayed.

**Constitution.**

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman-Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were issued making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act of 1883) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first Ministry was appointed.

The Ministry as at present constituted consists of:

- Prime Minister, who is also Minister for Native Affairs,
- Colonial Secretary, who is also Minister of Education,
- Minister of Agriculture, who is also Minister of Defence,
- Attorney-General,
- Minister for Railways and Harbours, and the Treasurer,

all of whom must hold seats in either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, but not more than two may be members of the Legislative Council.

In place of the Legislative Council as previously existing, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly are constituted.

The Legislative Council, consisting of thirteen members, is summoned by the Governor in Council. The members are summoned from the following districts of the Colony:—Five from within the counties of Durban, Victoria, Alexandra, and Alfred; three from within the counties of Pietermaritzburg and Umtata; three from within the counties of Weenen and Klip River; one from the Province of Zululand; and one from the New Territory; but not more than two members may be chosen from within any one county.

Each member holds his seat for ten years from the date of his summons, but five of the members first summoned vacate their seats at the end of five years.

No person may be summoned as a Member of the Legislative Council unless he be the registered proprietor of immovable property within the Colony of the value of 500l. in net value.

The Legislative Assembly is an elective body, and consists of 43 Members who must be duly qualified and registered electors, chosen by the electors of the several electoral districts, of which there are 17 in the Colony. The number of electors registered in 1907 was 23,686.

The duration of the Legislative Assembly is limited to four years from the date of the return of the writs of election, but the Governor may dissolve the Assembly whenever he may think fit.

The laws relating to the mode of election, the qualifications of electors, and to all other matters concerning elections, in force at the time of the passing of the Act, apply to the election of Members to serve in the Legislative Assembly. Under the Act No. 10 of 1898, provision is made for the Parliamentary representation of the Province of Zululand.

The reserved Civil List attached to the Constitution Act (No. 14, 1893), includes 2,900l. for pensions to officers retired on account of the change in the Constitution, and also 8,200l. for the salaries of the Governor and Ministers, 600l. for an Under Secretary for Native Affairs, and 10,000l. for the promotion of the welfare and education of the natives.

Members are not paid, but those residing more than two miles from the seat of Government receive 1l. per day travelling allowance. The session is usually from April to July or August.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or rents property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony for three years, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month, is entitled to vote.

**Local Government.**

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, and Dundee, and local boards in Verulam, Greytown, Utrecht Vryheid, Estcourt and South Barrow. Their total revenue in 1907 was 541,195l., their expenditure 603,008l., and their debt 3,548,226l.

**Native Affairs.**

In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele,
his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime mala in se. This system of government remains in operation at the present time under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was deprived of the franchise by a Law, No. 11 of 1865; but at the same time, and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may in certain cases apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently, by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work as well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government, and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for the exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875 a tax of 5s. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903 to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is about 2,400,000 acres. The land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Do. do. Mission Reserves   | 250,000           |

| Do. do. Zululand           | 213,000           |

**Climate and Inhabitants.**

The climate varies at different levels. On the coast line it is sub-tropical. On the high lands it is very little hotter than English summer weather in the summer months; in the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced, and snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer, and the sky is bright throughout the winter months.

Malarial fever was epidemic in coast districts during 1905 and 1906, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the authorities, it has been practically stamped out, while very few cases have occurred inland.

The death rates of Europeans or whites, including those classed in the Census returns as mixed and others, at Pietermaritzburg and Durban for 1907 were 12·28 and 10·34 per thousand respectively, and for the Colony 9·48.

About 84 per cent. of the inhabitants are Zulu natives, and about 10 per cent. are Indian coolies. At the 31st December, 1907, the European population, exclusive of His Majesty's troops, was estimated to be 92,485. At the census of 1904, the Europeans numbered 97,109, or 8·8 per cent., of whom about 12,500 were Dutch, the rest being chiefly British, with the exception of about 4,500 colonists of German descent, of whom the greater portion are settled in the New Hanover and Lower Umzimkulu divisions.

**Means of Communication.**

There is a weekly mail service with England (20 to 22 days), with the Cape and Inland Colonies daily, with Mauritius and East Coast ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Illo, etc.) once or twice a month, with Delagoa Bay, via the Transvaal, daily, with Australia fortnightly, and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. Steamers pass between Natal and Table Bay every week, calling at East London, Port Elizabeth, and Mossel Bay. There are also two direct lines of steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is about 26 days. Two mail and passenger trains leave daily for Johannesburg, and for Cape Town via either Johannesburg or Kroonstad (O.R.C.), the distance being accomplished in 24 hours to Johannesburg, and in from 60 to 64 hours to Capetown. There is also a daily mail and passenger service to Victoria Falls and Rhodesia, via Johannesburg and Fourteen Streams.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, the Cape, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the world generally. Telephonic communication by means of a trunk line has been established between the principal towns in the Colony, and with Johannesburg.

There are 1,964 miles of Government telegraphs constructed at a cost of about 243,315£., and the earnings of the Post and Telegraph Departments for the year 1907 were 182,683£. (exclusive of the value of Government messages, 39,802£.), and the expenses 187,985£.

Natal Government Railways.

Railway System as at 31st December, 1907.

There are 976 miles of railway open, all constructed and worked by the Government.

The main line, standard gauge 3 ft. 6 ins., extends from the Port of Durban to Pietermaritzburg (the capital of the Colony, 70 miles inland), and thence to Charlestown, on the border of the Transvaal (306 miles distant from the port), where it connects with the line to Johannesburg and Pretoria.

A branch line extends northwards from Durban to Somkela (167½ miles) in the Province of Zululand.

Another branch runs from South Coast Junction to North Shepstone (77½ miles), and places in touch with the town of Durban a portion of the Colony which has large natural resources.

A branch connecting the main line with the Bluff side (Wests) goes out from Clairmont on the South Coast Line, and is 6½ miles in length.

A line runs from the South Coast Branch at Alexandra Junction to Umzinto, 6½ miles distant, and serves an important sugar-growing area.

A branch line runs from Thornville Junction (59½ miles from the port) to Richmond (17 miles).

A branch line runs from Pietermaritzburg (the Natal Trunk Line junction) to Creighton, a distance of 95 miles, and an extension therefrom (12 miles) to Riverside, 3¾ miles within Griqualand East, is under construction.

A branch line runs from Pietermaritzburg to Greytown, a distance of 64½ miles.

Starting from Emmersdale, on the main line, a branch line runs to Winterton, 24 miles.

A branch to Harrismith in the Orange River Colony, from the main line at the 100½ mile post, was opened on the 12th July, 1892, with a mileage of 59½ miles, 35½ of which are in Natal, terminating at Van Reenen. This branch was extended to Bethlehem on the 1st of May, 1905, a distance of 64½ miles from Harrismith, and a further section of 88½ miles to Kroonstad, in the Orange River Colony, which place is also served by the C.S.A.R. main line, was opened for traffic on the 21st June, 1906. The line from Van Reenen to Bethlehem is owned by the C.S.A.R. Administration, and is worked by Natal on its behalf.

A branch line runs from Glencoe Junction (231½ miles from the port) to Vryheid, a distance of 59½ miles. An extension therefrom to Hlobane (17 miles) is under construction by agreement with a Coal and Iron Company.

* Letter postage to the U.K., India, and to other Colonies and countries which joined the Penny Post agreement, was reduced to 1½d. per ½ oz. from the 25th Dec., 1898. (See end of Introduction.)

A narrow gauge 2 ft. light railway is open between Estcourt, on the main line, and Weenen, a distance of 28½ miles.

Another light railway, at the 31st December, was being constructed between Esperanza, on the Umzinto Branch, and Donnybrook, on the Natal-Cape Line, passing through Stuartstown, a distance of 98 miles. The line has since been opened for general traffic, and is being worked by the contractors under agreement for a period of two years.

The work of railway construction was begun in January, 1876, and the sections then authorised were completed in December, 1880. Two subsequent extensions of 119 and 114 miles respectively were sanctioned, and the last, which completed the main line to Charlestown on the border of the Transvaal, was opened for passenger traffic on 7th April, 1891, and for goods traffic on 1st August, 1891. Connection with Johannesburg and Pretoria was opened on the 1st December, 1895.

The total cost of construction of the railways up to the end of 1907 was 13,995,729£. The receipts for 1907 were 1,843,148£. and the expenditure 1,273,587£. The net receipts were equal to 4½ st. 6½d. per cent. upon the capital expended on open lines.

Private owned Railways in Natal.

Stanger to Kearnsy Station, 7 miles, extension to Tea Factory, 1 mile—total, 8 miles; gauge, 2 ft.; maximum grade, 1 in 25 on 600 ft. curve; minimum radius between Stanger and Kearnsy, 300 ft.; minimum radius between Kearnsy and Tea Factory, 200 ft.; rails, 30 lbs. per yard; sleepers, pitch pine, 4 ft. 6 ins. by 6 ins. by 4 ins.; engines, one 6-wheeled coupled, 18 tons, German make; one 4-wheeled coupled. Approximate cost, 2,500£. per mile.

Industry.

The chief industries are the production of sugar, tea, wattle bark, wool, maize, potatoes, Kaffir corn and the mining of coal; dairying; fruit culture; and the breeding of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. The chief exports are coal, wool, mohair, wattle bark, tea, sugar, tobacco, maize, fruit and fruit preserves, hides and skins. The chief imports are apparel and cotton goods, haberdashery, woollen manufactures, leather goods, hardware and machinery, wooden manufactures, living animals, corn and grain, agricultural implements and seeds, articles of food and drink including frozen meats, tobacco, and books and stationery. A large and increasing trade, principally with the Orange River and Transvaal Colonies, is carried on, and the bulk of imports goes to those colonies. In 1897 the value of exports was 2,170,607£.; in 1907 their value had increased to 10,057,339£. In 1897 the value of imports was 5,983,589£.; and in 1907 they had increased to 8,704,222£.

The bar which used to exist at the entrance to the Port of Durban has been entirely removed, by an extension of the permanent works and by constant dredging, the average depth at low water in 1907 being 32 ft. 8 ins. as against 17 ft. 3 ins in 1897. The largest ships are now able at all times to come in and go out with perfect safety, and discharge their cargoes directly on to the wharves.

Durban is a port of registry, having in 1907, 27 vessels, with a tonnage of 1,667 tons net, including a few of the older vessels belonging to Government.

The land under cultivation amounted in 1907 to 833,671 acres, of which 347,900 acres were
cultivated by Europeans, and there is a good scope for dairying and stock-farming. An overseas export trade in maize was initiated in 1907, and as a result of the success which attended the Government's efforts in this direction, the area under the crop increased by 15 per cent. during the 1907-8 season, and a further increase is expected in regard to the 1908-9 crop. An overseas export trade in citrus fruits has also been commenced, and there appear to be great possibilities before the Colony in this direction; and it is also contemplated to experiment with the export of apples and other fruits shortly. A starch factory has been established on the coast, the raw material used for which is the sweet potato, which grows well in the Colony; and there is also a proposal on foot to establish a beet sugar factory at Pietermaritzburg. The coal-mining industry continues to increase every year, the output for 1907 being 1,530,043 tons (the value of which at the pit's mouth was £60,391), as against 216,106 tons in 1896 (value 108,053 at the pit's mouth). The amount consumed in the Railway Department in 1907 was 245,480 tons. There is also a considerable and growing trade in bunker and export coal, the coal bunkered in 1907 being 606,830 tons, and exported, 457,973 tons. There were 22 outputting collieries in 1907. The present output is at the rate of over 1,500,000 tons per annum, and this rate will be increased. The freight charge for railway transport is ½d. a ton per mile.

The produce of sugar in 1907 was 27,130 tons (short). A large quantity of sugar-cane is grown for the purpose of feeding stock. The production of maize in 1907 by European farmers was 1,666,296 bushels (555,432 muids); tea, 2,965,838 lbs.; wattle bark, 11,846 tons; potatoes, 430,299 bushels; sweet potatoes, 140,430 bushels; wool, 1,979,999 lbs. The principal stock owned by Europeans were cattle, 227,748; horses, 30,344; sheep, 661,466; goats, 131,811; pigs, 24,922; poultry, 313,496.

The agricultural and mining interests of the Colony are looked after by a staff of experts, under the Minister of Agriculture. These comprise the Director of Experiment Stations, Entomologist, Conservator of Forests, Analyst, Principal Veterinary Surgeon, Government Bacteriologist, and Commissioner of Mines. The official journal of the Department of Agriculture is the Natal Agricultural Journal and Mining Record, which is issued monthly.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South Africa, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, and the National Bank of South Africa have together thirty-six establishments, with 3,651,111 deposits in 1907. A Government savings bank was established in 1868, and had in 1907 (December 31st) a balance to credit of depositors of 502,673.

Education.

In the year ended 30th June, 1907, there were 523 schools under Government inspection—301 European, 19 coloured, 170 native, and 33 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of 28,847. There are 49 Government schools, and 474 Government-aided schools. The management is vested in the Minister of Education, with the Superintendent of Education as permanent head of the Department, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is not compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. The expenditure on education, for the financial year 1906-07, amounted to 102,033. 3s. 10½d., and the revenue to 14,222. 7s.
