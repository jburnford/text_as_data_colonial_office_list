WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between British subjects living in these islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, New South Wales, or New Zealand, and not being within the jurisdiction of any civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1907, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met from Imperial funds.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner, and where the attendance of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court is impracticable, the High Commissioner may appoint a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases occurring where there is no resident Deputy Commissioner, certain officers in command of His Majesty's ships of war on the Australian station have been appointed Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

PRINCIPAL GROUPS UNDER THE HIGH COMMISSIONER.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, are situated between the 20th and 23rd degrees of south latitude. The islands are most of them of coral formation, but include some active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafouo (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra (the dried kernel of the nut) forms the principal export. Bananas and oranges are also exported from Vavau, in the northern part of the group. There is regular steam communication with Auckland (1,000 miles distant), Sydney (1,850 miles), and Fiji, and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles). Sailing vessels carry the copra to Europe.

The late king, George Tubou, was the first of its chiefs or kings to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, and his rule on the whole was fairly successful. The king is assisted by a native parliament and a privy council. With the exception of a few Europeans in the Customs, Education, and Medical Departments, the whole of the Government officers are Tongans. The tariff resembles that of Fiji, and licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades. The revenue and expenditure in 1907 amounted to 34,912l. and 33,541l., respectively. According to the official returns the imports and exports were:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
|      | £ s. d. | £ s. d. |
| 1896 | 90,915 0 5 | 91,602 4 5 |
| 1897 | 74,561 5 11 | 64,391 3 6 |
| 1898 | 35,175 17 10 | 39,464 7 5 |
| 1899 | 74,124 4 1 | 70,911 7 4 |
| 1900 | 88,718 0 0 | 106,793 0 0 |
| 1901 | 64,259 0 0 | 88,008 0 0 |
| 1904 | 60,295 0 0 | 86,425 0 0 |
| 1905 | 76,868 0 0 | 110,728 0 0 |
| 1906 | 79,363 0 0 | 137,583 0 0 |
| 1907 | 97,820 0 0 | 134,193 0 0 |

but the value of the copra exported in the years previous to 1904 is about 20 per cent. too high. The shipping in 1906 was 98,108 tons. The native population is about 21,000; the European about 240. The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are five churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years), with at present about 3,000 adherents only; the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents; the "Free Church of England," founded by Mr. Shirley Baker, the number of whose adherents is unknown; and the Church of England recently established by Dr. Willis, late Anglican Bishop of Honolulu. The Free Church of Tonga was established in 1883, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakagoo," i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Waldemar Baker, the Premier, an ex-Wesleyan missionary. Six persons charged with complicity in the attempt were shot. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakagos," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church, whose houses were pillaged, and who were beaten with clubs and whips till they declared their adhesion to the "Free Church." About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren inhospitable islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakago" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he, in accordance with the power conferred on the High Commissioner by the Western Pacific Orders in Council, issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make the necessary arrangements for their return.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufaahau, under the title of George Tubou II.
By the Convention of 14th November, 1899, Germany renounced all rights over Tonga Islands, including Vavau, and over Savage Island (Nieuie).

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed by Mr. Thomson, in Tonga, and, by consent of the chiefs, in Savage Island also.

In December, 1904, and January, 1905, the High Commissioner, Sir Everard im Thurn, spent some time in Tonga, re-organising the system of administration—which had by that time fallen into some disorder, and receiving an undertaking from the king of more strict compliance with the liabilities assumed by him, under the Treaty of 1890. The Premier, Josatife, Toga, and the Treasurer were removed to Fiji, under an Order in Council; and Jione Mataialona was appointed to the Premiership, which office he has since retained. The progress of Tonga has since been very satisfactory.

All the natives are taught to read and write, and higher education is provided by colleges established by the Government and by the Wesleyan Mission.

British and foreign subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine and local police, not recognised as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

The Union Group consists of three small islands, Fakaofo, Oatafu, and Nukunono, about 9° S. latitude and 172° W. longitude. The islands are coral atolls, and the principal article of trade is copra. The natives are of Polynesian race, and are about 1,000 in number. They are ruled by their own chiefs, with the assistance of native councils. A British Protectorate has been proclaimed over this group. The inhabitants are either adherents of the London Missionary Society, or Roman Catholics.

The Ellice and Gilbert Groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 5° N. latitude and 10° S. latitude, and 170° to 180° E. longitude. The principal export is copra. The natives are of Malay-Polynesian race, and number about 30,000, and are most of them now adherents either of American or British Nonconformist Missions, or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. The islands have separate kings or chiefs, who are assisted by councils of chiefs and commoners. These groups have now been placed under British protection. Courts of law have been established amongst the natives, and a revenue is obtained from native contributions and trade licences, which covers the cost of maintaining a regular government in the islands. The efforts of Mr. C. R. Swayne, the first British Resident, and of his successor, Mr. W. T. Campbell, to establish an efficient system of administration have met with considerable success.

Ocean Island, or Paanopa, in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 36' E., was annexed, and included in the jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Protectorate in 1900. It is now the site of most successful operations by the Pacific Phosphate Company, whose European employees there number about 80.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaita, San Christoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ontong-Java, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 73rd and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. Stations have been established by the Melanesian Mission, and by the Roman Catholic, but the converts are not numerous. The natives have been described as treacherous; many of them are still head-hunters and cannibals. A large number of natives used to go under indenture to labour in Queensland, Fiji and Samoa; but these are now excluded by law from Queensland, very few now go to Fiji, and fewer still to Samoa. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros., and more lately, Burn, Philips, have recently undertaken coconut planting on a large scale, and have introduced many white men for the superintendence of labour. The principal articles of trade are copra, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is not a good one. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893. The British Resident Commissioner has his headquarters at Tulagi, a small island between Guadalcanar and Malaita, where there is a Customs House and Port Office. There are also British magistrates at the Shortland Islands and at Gizo. There is a fairly regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales. By the convention between Great Britain and Germany on 14th November, 1899, Choiseul and Isabel came within the British sphere.

The Santa Cruz Islands are situated between the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides Group. The natives are Melanesians, and are mostly adherents of the Melanesian Mission. The principal trade is in copra. These islands, together with the Duff and Reef Groups, Cherry, Mitre, and Tucopia Islands, were in 1898 included in the British Solomons Protectorate, and are now subject to the Regulations under which that Protectorate is administered.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The population has been estimated at from 100,000 to 140,000, but the Mission returns place it at only 50,000. Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church. A large number of the natives are still cannibals. Life is, however, safer than in the Solomon Islands. A very few native labourers still go to Fiji, and to New Caledonia. There is a European population of about 630, mostly British or French. A British steamer runs regularly between Sydney and the group, and a French steamer also runs from New Caledonia. The principal exports are copra, maize, and coffee, timber and sulphur are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is bad, and malarial fever is prevalent. A joint commission,
of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on the 20th October, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, have now been appointed and are at work in this group, each with a staff of officers; and the buildings necessary for the various officers and for the Joint Court are in course of erection. It is anticipated that before the end of 1909 the Joint Government will be fully established.

**PITCAIRN ISLAND.**

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25°3' S. lat., 130°8' E. long.), and is contiguous to the low archipelago (Tuamotu), which is under French protection. It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1780, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1873 these had increased to 76, and in 1879 to 90. The present population is 144.

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, Arthur H. Young.

**THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.**

**Situation, Area, and Trade.**

The Windward Islands consist of the three islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically. The three last named islands are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the three Colonies is 324 square mils (about twice the size of Middlesex), and their population 177,882.

1907-8—Revenue, 175,679l.; Expenditure, 157,876l.

**History.**

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

**Constitution.**

Each island retains its own institutions, and, when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados. The Colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. A common audit system was instituted in 1889.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

**Communications.**

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 14 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours.
at Barbados for the purpose of transhipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call fortnightly, and there is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Trinidad Shipping and Trading Company, Grenada being the first and last port of call. The Pickford and Black Steamship Company's steamers call regularly at St. Lucia and St. Vincent and connect these islands with Canada, St. John or Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telephone system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe, the United States, Canada, and the other West Indian islands by cable to Havana and Bermuda. The rate per word for telegrams to Europe from Grenada is 4s. 9d. (Government messages, 3s. 4½d.)

The Rates of Postage are:

| Letters per 1 oz. | Newspapers |
|------------------|------------|
| Internal         | 1d.        |
| To U.K., India, and certain Colonies | 1d. |

**GRENADA.**

Situation, Area, &c.

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 8,467 acres, and a population (at 31st Dec., 1907) of 7,545 souls.

General Description.

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and brushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities; near the former a sanatorium is established. All the roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. About 133 miles of main roads, all drivable, and a perfect network of byways (275 miles), all in good condition, provide for the important item of inland communication. The island is divided into six districts or parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John, while the dependencies of Carriacou, Petit Martinique and other adjacent islets form a separate district, administered by a resident Commissioner. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping and had on 31st December, 1906, 84 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,265 tons; its fine harbour, owing to its situation, healthiness, and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call and coaling station for steamers. The town had a population of 5,198 by census of 7th April, 1901.

The other towns in the colony are Gouyave (or Charlotte Town), Victoria (or Grand Pauvre), Sauteurs; Grenville (or La Baye); and Hillsborough, in Carriacou. English is universally spoken, but the peasantry speak among themselves a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the Negro race, except the East Indian population, which amounts to about 2,300 souls.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. Yellow fever, the bugbear of the West Indies, is almost unknown, and if new arrivals do get a touch of "acclimatising fever," which is far from being the rule, it is mild and soon disappears. The average annual rainfall at St. George's for the last fifteen years is 79 inches, and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer for the last five years are 89°8' and 67°8' respectively, the average mean temperature being 78°8' in the shade. The rainfall in other parts of the island is much greater; at the Grand Etang, in 1907, it was 131 inches.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. Unlike the other islands, however, it has long ceased to be a sugar-producing
colony, and has therefore not suffered as they have from the depreciation in the value of cane sugar. There is at present hardly any sugar-cane cultivation. The chief produce of Grenada is, and has been for some time, cocoa, of which a total value of £61,128l. was shipped in 1907. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such, for instance, as coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, &c. Nutmeg cultivation occupies a prominent position. So general is the cultivation of spices carried on here, that Grenada may be called "The Spice Island of the West." The export of spices has increased from £3,483l. in 1880, to £5,954l. in 1907. In Carriacou cotton is the staple product; its cultivation having never been wholly abandoned there; the value exported in 1907 was £7,731l. Tropical fruits of almost every description and of the finest quality are fairly plentiful, and are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, taro, cassava, breadfruit, &c. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullet wood, locust, mahogany, white cedar, galba, &c., and firewood is exported to Barbados. Rum is manufactured for local consumption, the total number of gallons in 1907 being 46,675.

The main imports are food-stuffs, textiles, timber for building purposes, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are turtles and turtle-shell, hides and skins, fruit, and live stock (principally goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry).

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,548; acreage of Carriacou, 8,467.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George's, established in 1881, and extended to the out districts in 1889, and the number of depositors on 31st December, 1907, was 1,638 and 15,419l. deposited.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. A settlement was attempted in 1609 by a company of London merchants, but the colonists were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1630 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French Company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillas for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the British Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1795-6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated and assisted by the French. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred in cold blood, and the colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercrombie suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the African slaves.

Constitution.

There was from the time of annexation by Great Britain a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the Legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was remodelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict. c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a Legislative Council was established in December, 1877, by the Queen, which now consists of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The unofficial members hold their seats for six years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and on 1st June, 1885, Grenada became the headquarters of the Government, which includes the colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

The Government is assisted in the internal administration by six semi-elective District Boards, and by unofficial Road Wardens, who, with Road Surveyors attached to the Public Works Department, attend to the upkeep of the main roads.

Education.

There are 45 elementary schools, 9 Government and 36 aided. These schools are of three classes, Infant, Lower Division and Combined, and the law also provides for a fourth class, Industrial schools. Head teachers are paid from 40l. to 100l. per annum, according to their certificates of proficiency, and to the class of school. Bonuses are given them for exceptional merit or extra duties. Grants are also given by Government in aid of buildings, furniture and apparatus. The
administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1907 the average attendance was 4,850 children, the number on the rolls being 10,406. There is a grammar school for boys, and two schools for the secondary education of girls, all of which receive grants-in-aid from the general revenue.
