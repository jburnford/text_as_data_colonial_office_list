RHODESIA.*

Rhodesia (so called after the late Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes) is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in its Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese Dominions." Of these extensive territories the Company is now responsible for the administration of the following portions:

1. Southern Rhodesia, or the provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland (area 148,575 square miles).

2. Northern Rhodesia, or the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo Free State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the British Central Africa Protectorate. It is divided into two provinces—North-Eastern Rhodesia and North-Western Rhodesia. The area of the former is estimated at 109,000 square miles, and the latter at 182,000 square miles.

I.—SOUTHERN RHODESIA.

The limits of Southern Rhodesia, as defined by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 20th October, 1898, are the parts of South Africa bounded by the Portuguese Possessions, by the Transvaal Colony to a point opposite the mouth of the River Shashi, by the River Shashi to its junction with the Tati and Ramaquaban rivers, thence by the Ramaquaban river to its source, thence by the watershed to the Rivers Shashi and Ramaquaban until such watershed strikes the Hunter's Road (called the Pandamatenka Road), thence by that road to the River Zambesi, and by that river to the Portuguese boundary. The said limits include an area of ten miles' radius round Fort Tuli, but exclude the area of the district known as the Tati district defined by the Charter.

II.—NORTHERN RHODESIA.

This territory is divided into two provinces:

(a.) Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.

(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.

(a.) The limits of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia are the parts of Africa bounded on the North by the Congo Free State, on the West by Portuguese West Africa, on the South by the River Zambesi, and on the East by North-Eastern Rhodesia.

(b.) The limits of North-Eastern Rhodesia are the parts of Africa bounded on the west by the boundaries of the Congo Free State and of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia; on the south by Portuguese East Africa; on the east by the British Central Africa Protectorate; and on the north by the German East Africa frontier, the south shore of Lake Tanganyika, and the southern frontier of the Congo Free State as far west as Lake Mweru, including the Island of Kilwa in the British sphere.

SOUTHERN NIGERIA.

Situation and Boundaries.

The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria comprise that portion of territory on the West Coast of Africa which is bounded on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by the line of the frontier of the French territory of Dahomey, on the north and north-east by the British Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and on the east by the frontier of the German territory of Kamerun. Its area is estimated at 77,260 square miles.

Constitution.

By letters patent dated 28th of February, 1906, the Colony of Southern Nigeria was formed, and was amalgamated with the Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate under one Administration, under the style of the "Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria," with headquarters in Lagos Town.

The Government is administered by a Governor assisted by an Executive and Legislative Council composed of official and unofficial members.

Administration.

For purposes of administration Southern Nigeria is divided into three Provinces, namely: the Western or Lagos Province comprising the former Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate, with Headquarters in Lagos Town; the Central or Niger Province with Headquarters at Warri; and the Eastern or Calabar Province with Headquarters at Calabar; the two latter Provinces comprising what was formerly known as the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Each Province is presided over by a Provincial Commissioner and divided into Districts under the charge of District Commissioners and Assistant District Commissioners.

Law and Justice.

The laws in force in the old Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and the old Colony and Protectorate of Lagos were codified and consolidated in 1908, and issued in two volumes under a Statute Law Revision Ordinance.

The Supreme Court for the whole Colony and Protectorate, presided over by the Chief Justice, holds Assizes at the principal centres. There are District Courts, with limited Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction, presided over by Commissioners, and there are Police Magistrates' Courts with similar jurisdiction at Lagos, Warri and Calabar.

The Supreme Court decides appeals from the inferior Courts in Civil matters, and the Chief Justice has a power of revision of the decision of Commissioners in criminal cases. The Chief Justice and Puisne Judge are, ex officio, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Courts of Northern Nigeria, while the Chief Justices and Puisne Judges of Northern Nigeria are, ex officio, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Court of Southern Nigeria.

Native Courts have been established throughout the districts in the Eastern and Central Provinces. The District Commissioner sits as President of the Court, and in his absence the Assistant District Commissioner. The Courts have, subject to the approval of the High Commissioner, power to make Rules providing for the
peace, good order and welfare of the Natives. Native law is administered in all the Courts in so far as it is not incompatible with any Statute and not repugnant to natural justice.

Post and Telegraph.

| Letters per oz. | Newspapers per 4 ozs. |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Within the Colony and Protectorate | 1d. | ½d. |
| To the United Kingdom, India, and certain Colonies | 1d. | 1d. |
| Other Postal Union Countries above | 2½d. | 1d. |

Parcels to and from the United Kingdom and British Colonies in West Africa, 3 lbs. 1s., 7 lbs. 2s., 11 lbs. 3s.

Foreign Money Order and Parcels Post systems are in operation with the United Kingdom, Northern Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia, and orders are issued for sums up to 40l. at a commission of 4d. per l.

Inland Money Order and Parcels Post systems are also in operation, the commission on Inland Money Orders being 3d. per l. The rates on Inland Parcels are 7d., 1½d. and 1s. 3d. for 3 lbs., 7 lbs. and 11 lbs respectively. There is also an Inland Registration system under which compensation to the extent of 120l. can be secured on prepayment of fees ranging from 2d. to 8d.

A Cash on Delivery Service has recently been started with the United Kingdom and certain British possessions. It is for the present confined to the offices at Lagos, Calabar and Warri, and the value of a packet is limited to 20l.

British Postal Orders are issued and paid throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

An Inland Government Telegraph system has now been successfully completed, whereby telegraphic communication is rendered possible between the chief centres of the whole Colony and Protectorate, without having recourse to the cable which runs from Lagos to Brass and Bonny in the Eastern Province. In addition to the telegraphic stations along the railway line from Lagos, via Ibadan to the boundary with Northern Nigeria, the principal telegraphic stations in the Central and Eastern Provinces are Owo, Ifon, Benin City, Sapele, Warri, Forcados, Asaba, Onitsha, Oguta, Owerri, Aba, Calabar, Egwanga, and Bonny.

Telegraph rate is 1d. per word with a minimum charge of 1s. 1,561 miles of line are open, with 2,300 miles of wire. Further extensions are in progress.

The African Direct Telegraph Company maintains cable communication, which places Lagos Town in touch with all parts of the globe.

Education.

The Headquarters of the Director of Education are in Lagos Town. Each Province has an Education Office under a Provincial Inspector of Schools, and a Board of Education with advisory powers. Education is not compulsory. In the Western Province there are six Government Schools, including the large Government Moslem School in Lagos Town. There are 18 Government Schools in the Central, and 16 in the Eastern Province. There are 36 assisted Mission Schools maintained in connection with the Church Missionary Society, the Roman Catholic and Wesleyan Missions, and the Native United African Church. These are distributed among Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, Oyo and other places. The numbers of Assisted Schools in the other Provinces is 37, 12 being in the Central and 25 in the Eastern. There are 2,838 pupils on the rolls of the Government Schools with an average attendance of 1,931, and about 10,000 on the rolls of the Assisted Schools, with an average attendance of about 6,000. The Government grants to Assisted Schools during the year 1908 amounted to 5,854l. the expenditure on Government Schools reaching a total of 12,003l. The Mahomedans maintain a few of their own schools, where Arabic is taught. Six Government Schools, in which elementary instruction in English is given, have been established for this section of the population.

The system of education provides for Primary and Intermediate Schools, High Schools, and Technical Schools. These are of two kinds:- Government and Assisted Schools; to the latter are awarded grants-in-aid which are earned by examination.

There is a large Residential Government School at Bonny in the Eastern Province, provided with a Technical and Industrial Department, where carpentering, cooperating and other crafts are taught.

There is a High School at Calabar under the management of the United Presbyterian Free Church of Scotland, styled the Hope Waddell Training Institute. This school is in receipt of substantial assistance from Government.

The Roman Catholic Mission, besides extending its work on the River Niger, has erected boys' and girls' schools at Calabar, which are eminently successful. In addition to the above a number of schools are conducted by the Church Missionary Society, the Niger Delta Pastorate Mission, the Primitive Methodist Mission and the Onitsha Industrial Mission.

Climate.

Southern Nigeria may be divided into wet and dry zones comprising, respectively, territory south and north of 6° 15' north latitude with, roughly, a total yearly rainfall, in the one case of above, and in the other, below 76 inches. There are four seasons—the wet, the dry, and two tornado seasons. The wet zone, in this respect, is about a month behind the dry zone. The dry season may be said to begin about November, lasting till March, when the first tornado season occurs, whilst the wet season lasts from about May to July, followed by the second tornado season. During the months of December and January a cold north-east wind, known as the Harmattan, prevails, and is accompanied by fog.

The mean temperature at the Lagos observatory in 1907 was 80° 4', the highest shade temperature being 96° in February, and the lowest 68° in August.

The rainfall in Lagos in 1907 was 79' 46 inches, and varied from 32 to 216 in different parts of the country.

The climate of Southern Nigeria is not healthy for Europeans.

Trade.

The principle articles of export are palm oil and palm kernels, cocoa, rubber, lumber, ivory, ebony, and ground nuts. An increasing amount of cotton is also being exported.
The following table indicates the quantity and value of certain of the country's exports in 1907.

| Article                  | Quantity       | Value     |

| Shea Products            |               | 31,611    |

Currency and Banking.

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with gold dust and nuggets, and some Spanish, American, and French gold coins; but by Ordinance 7 of 1894 gold dust and nuggets were demonetised. Cowries (1,000 = 3d.) are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders.

A Government savings bank was established on the 1st of January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on the 31st December, 1907, held deposits amounting to 30,813£ for 2,688 depositors. It is now managed as a post office savings bank.

Specie amounting to 599,567£ was imported during 1907. Of this, 479,867£ was imported by mercantile firms, the balance of 119,700£ being required by the Government of Northern Nigeria.

A large proportion of the specie imported for Northern Nigeria filters into the hands of the firms trading on the Niger, and eventually into Southern Nigeria.

A new subsidiary coinage for Nigeria was issued during 1908. It consists of a nickel penny and an aluminium tenth of a penny, the latter being the first coin of this metal issued from a British mint. Southern Nigeria takes the whole risk of the issue, but the coinage will be current throughout the whole of Nigeria. Northern Nigeria took 5,700£ of the new pennies during the year, and about 2,400£ worth was put into circulation in Southern Nigeria. The aluminium tenth, having lost its appearance, has not been a success, and is to be withdrawn and replaced by a similar coin made of nickel.

During 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged into a company named the Bank of British West Africa, and has now also established a branch at Calabar. There is, further, a banking establishment known as the Bank of Nigeria, Limited, which has branches at Burutu and Calabar, with its central office at Lagos.

WESTERN OR LAGOS PROVINCE

Is situated on the Bight of Benin, and consists of the coast line from the boundary of Dahomey on the west, to the boundary line of the Central Province, one mile south-east of the village of Omoloma, on the confines of the Shekiri Country, on the Mahin Beach on the east, and includes Badagry, Lagos Island, upon which is situated Lagos Town (capital of the Colony and Protectorate), Ebute Metta, Iddo Island, Ikorodu, Ejirin, and Epe, with Palma, Leckie, and Ode.

Ikorodu is the latest acquisition to the Colony (ceded August, 1894), and the Jebu strip on the north bank of the lagoon now extends from Orichi on the Ogun River, in a direct line half a mile to the north of the village of Majoda, situated on the road between Epe and Jebu Ode, and from thence proceeding due east to the Oshun River. By this acquisition the Colony commands all the main routes to the interior.

The Protectorate before 1900 comprised the kingdoms of Pokra, Okedolan, Ilaro, Addo, and Igbesse, with the Awori country, Jebu Remo (1894), Mahin, Itebi, Ayesan, and Ibu, up to the town of Ogbo on the east.

By an Order in Council issued at the end of 1899 the Protectorate was extended to the boundaries of Northern and the Protectorate then known as Southern Nigeria.

The boundary with Dahomey is at the coast at 2° 46' 55" E. long., and was delimited in 1896 by an Anglo-French Commission as far as the 9th parallel.

For administrative purpose the Province is divided into Districts, which include the protected territories of Egba Land and Ibadan.

* 105,810£ chargeable against surplus balances amounting to 717,000£.
They are:—Lagos, including Ebute Metta and Iddo Island, Epe, Ikorodu, Shagamu, Badagry, Meko, Ijiroko, Oyo, Shaki, Ilesha, Ondo, Abeokuta and Ibadan.

District Commissioners are stationed in each of the foregoing districts, the officer in charge at Ibadan retaining the title of Resident.

Lagos Island has an area of 57 square miles, whilst that of the province as a whole is estimated at 27,640 square miles.

The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Freetown, 315 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass. At this part of the West Coast a series of low islands runs along the coast, separating the mainland from the sea, and forming numerous lagoons and creeks. Along these lagoons steamers ply, without entering the ocean, as far as Porto Novo on the west and Siluko on the Ofus Wena River, on the east. The only opening for many miles to the sea is at Lagos.

History.

The King of Lagos (Kosokol), having refused to co-operate in putting down the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akitoye's son and successor, King Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown in consideration of a pension of £1,000 a year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate Government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council; but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further Letters Patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Iddo Island. In 1862, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Kotonu, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Kotonu, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1885, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.

In 1890, Kotonu was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagry.

In 1891 the kingdoms of Igbessa, Addo and Ilaro were included in the protectorate, and in 1894 Jehu Remo was similarly dealt with, Mahin, Itetu, Ihu, and Ayessan being proclaimed protectorates in 1895.

An expedition was sent against the Jebus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Colony of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

Agreements have been concluded with the Egba native Government, and with the chiefs of the Ibadan, Oyo, and Ife provinces, vesting in His Majesty the King power and jurisdiction therein in all murder and manslaughter cases, and in all cases in which one or both of the parties is not a subject thereof respectively.

Industry.

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, brickmaking, pottery, bead work, ivory carving, and the working of iron.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the island waters, the fish being dried and sent up into the interior.

Cotton planting has been commenced under the auspices of the Government, and the prospects are encouraging.

The British Cotton Growing Association have now, by arrangement with the Colonial Office, taken over the management of the industry, and very considerable tracts of land at Ilugan, near Ibadan, and between Aro and Abeokuta, have been drained, cleaned and planted.

An export trade in corn (maize) has recently sprung up, and is steadily growing.

A small sugar mill has also been erected at Agbowa, in the Colony, and there seems a possibility that the sugar-cane may be extensively grown.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, and mahogany. The chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France.

Chief Towns.

Lagos Town, including Ebute Metta, has now about 50,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the West African coast. Within the Colony Epe may be considered as next in order, with a population of about 16,000. In the interior Abeokuta and Ibadan are believed to contain respectively about 150,000 and 200,000 inhabitants.

The estimated European population in Lagos Town, including Ebute Metta, is just over 400, and comprises officials, merchants, missionaries, and a few European ladies. The total European population of the Western Province is roughly estimated at 541.

Means of Communication.

In March, 1901, the present Government Railway was opened and extended from Iddo Island, which lies between Lagos Island and the mainland, to Ibadan, a distance of 123½ miles.

Recent construction, however, has added yet another 124 miles of open line which now reaches Ilorin in Northern Nigeria territory, from which point further construction is rapidly progressing. Railhead is expected to reach Jebba, on the Niger, a distance of 303 miles from Lagos, in December, 1908.
From Jebba, the line is being pushed on as quickly as possible to a point about 25 miles beyond Zungeru (about 145 from Jebba), where a junction will take place with the Pioneer Line being constructed by the Northern Nigeria Government, from Baro (on the Niger 130 miles below Jebba) to Zaria and Kano, large commercial centres, in the north of Northern Nigeria. The funds for both these lines are being found by Southern Nigeria; the assistance received by that Administration is limited to a refund of the interest charged on the expenditure on the Baro-Kano line, estimated at £200,000. The annual grant of £70,000, exacted from Southern Nigeria towards the cost of administering the Northern Territory, continues. The Niger is to be crossed at Jebba by a six-wagon train ferry to Jebhu island, and a bridge over the Northern channel of the river. The construction of a bridge across the Southern channel, in lieu of the ferry, is under consideration.

The railway terminus is on Iddo Island, where a fine station has been erected, and which is connected by road bridges with the main-land and with Lagos Island.

These are:—the Carter Bridge, which extends from Lagos to Iddo Island and is 2,500 feet long, carried on steel screw piles some 100 feet long; and the Denton Railway Road Bridge, connecting Iddo Island with the main-land and 900 feet long. A steam tramway connects Lagos Town with Iddo railway station.

During the year 1907 a Government road motor transport service of three Lacre cars and a Thornycroft lorry was inaugurated between Oyo and Ibadan, a distance of 35 miles, and further road extension is in progress and in contemplation to develop motor traffic. This pioneer service has proved very popular, and has already decreased the cost of transport by at least 50 per cent. These motor services are expected to act as feeders of traffic to the railway, and will be replaced by branch railway lines as soon as the traffic developed on any road warrants the large capital expenditure required for constructing a railway line.

A branch line of about 2 miles in length connects the town of Abeokuta with the main line at Aro Junction, 60 miles distant from Lagos.

There is regular communication with Europe by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company. A weekly mail service is maintained between Liverpool and Lagos, the time occupied on the outward voyage being about 16 days.

Steamers of the German Woermann Linie also maintain direct communication between Southampton and Lagos at intervals of one month. There is also a regular weekly mail service between Lagos and Northern Nigeria.

Extensive works are in progress with a view to making Lagos an open port. A mole is being constructed at the eastern entrance to the harbour, and a powerful dredger has been at work during the year. A second dredger is on order. Vessels drawing 13 feet can now cross the bar. Passengers are transferred to tenders in the Lagos roads by means of surf boats, the large steamer then proceeding to Forcalhos.

There is a system of telephones between the various Government Offices and the principal commercial houses in Lagos Town.

EASTERN AND CENTRAL PROVINCES.

Situation and Boundaries.

The Eastern and Central Provinces are bounded on the North-west by the Western or Lagos Province, as described above, on the North by the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, and on the North-east by the German territories of the Kameruns, whilst on the South and South-west they are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean.

The boundary between the Lagos Province and the Central or Niger Province starts from a point on the sea beach of the Bight of Benin in latitude 5° 52' 20" and longitude 4° 57' 18" about a mile S.E. of the village of Omoloma. The boundary follows a straight line to the junction of the Lagos and the Adabassa Creeks, continuing up the middle of the Opofanga, Kokotoro, Jojoboko, Kofuturo (or Siluko) Creeks, thence up the middle of the Ofuso-Wena River to its junction with the Owena River, thence up the middle of the Ofuso River to its junction with its tributary the Abere, thence in a straight line to the junction of the Akure and Usho main road with the Ogbesi River.

From this point the Northern Nigeria boundary follows a line from the villages Usho, Amurin to Emure-Ile, thence to Egpensi and along the Owo road through the village of Oreia and Suada to the point where that road crosses the Ogbesere stream. It then follows the course of the Ogbesere stream to its junction with the Owese River and then the course of the Owese River to the point where it crosses the Ipele-Iduani road. From here the boundary runs in a north-easterly direction through Iduani and Yaifa, thence easterly to Idogun and Ogpe, thence southerly through Itwa to Ake and on to Ushoka, from which village it proceeds in a south-easterly direction to Shebe and on through Yadu to Aushi; thence through Jattu to Uyece and in an easterly direction through Aiota, Afana, Gufu and Goronu to Fuga. From Fuga the line runs to Yanegpode, and thence in an easterly direction to a point about ten miles north-east of Idah on the Niger. The exact boundary north of Idah and affecting the territory immediately east of the Niger is in course of delimitation.

The boundary continues in a straight line slightly north of the 7th parallel of latitude to a point near Ashuku on the Anglo-German frontier as laid down in the Convention of 1893. From this point the boundary runs in a straight line to the rapids on the Cross River and thence to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The area of the Protectorate is estimated at 49,620 square miles.

The numerous rivers, creeks and estuaries in this part of the West African coast have received the name of the "Oil Rivers," from the fact of their producing the bulk of the palm oil, which constitutes the chief export of West Africa. The Niger has formed a huge delta with a coast line of over 200 miles from the mouth of the Benin river to Opobo. The coast district here for a long distance, varying from 20 to 40 miles inland, is a mere network of "creeks" and "Islands." Into this delta several other considerable rivers empty themselves, the chief being on the west, the Benin with its affluents, the Osse, Ologi, Jameson and Ethiope, and on the east the Imo with its affluents the Otaminne and Azumine.

The chief mouths of the Niger are at the Forcalhos estuary, communicating with Warri, Sapele and Benin, the Nun mouth at Akassa, and at Brass.
The Engenni, New Calabar, and Opobo Rivers enter the sea by the broad estuaries known as the Sombrero, the New Calabar, the Bonny, the Andoni, and the Opobo Rivers, and drain a fertile, undulating country, watered by numerous little brooks, and with a rich soil free from marsh, and where cattle appear to thrive.

Further east is the Calabar estuary, mainly formed by the great Cross River, some 400 or 500 miles in length, which drains, with its affluents the Calabar, Aqua, Akpayfe and the Ndian Rivers, the high mountain ranges running north-west from the Kamerun mountains to the hills round the confluence of the Niger and the Benue.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants are typical negroes, and though now divided into several distinct tribes, appear to have had a common origin. Among the most prominent tribes are the Jekri, occupying the lower part of the Benin Country, and closely allied to the Yorubas; the Ijos, occupying the part of the delta east of the Middleton, and south of the Warri and of the Ibo country; the Ibos, occupying the lower Niger just above the delta, and extending to the Cross River, where they join the Akuna-kunas, being an industrious agricultural people, with fine herds of cattle; and the Efiks and "Kwas" in the Calabar region.

History.

The British Protectorate of the Niger districts (Oil Rivers Protectorate) was announced in the London Gazette of 5th June, 1885. It extended along the West Coast of Africa from a point on the shore of the Bight of Benin about ten miles north-west of the Benin River to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The part between the Forcados River and the Nun mouth of the Niger was included in the territories administered by the Royal Niger Company under their Charter of 10th July, 1886.

By an Order in Council, dated the 13th May, 1893, the Protectorate was extended under the name of the Niger Coast Protectorate, and an administration established under Sir Claude MacDonald, K.C.M.G., K.C.B., as Imperial Commissioner and Consul-General; he was succeeded in this office, in 1896, by Sir R. Moor, K.C.M.G.

On the taking over of the territories of the Royal Niger Company in 1900 the Niger Coast Protectorate was extended so as to include the part lying between Idah on the Niger and the Coast, which had been formerly administered by the Company, and the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was constituted under an Order in Council, dated the 27th December, 1899, the administration being transferred from the Foreign to the Colonial Office.

Domestic Slavery.

A system of domestic slavery was, until recently, universally recognised—the father or the mother having the power of sale, according to their position in the "House." The evil was aggravated by that peculiar development of the system known as "pawning," under which a debtor could temporarily liquidate the claims of his creditor by handing over as security either himself or a child or a slave, and by the power which the creditor possessed in turn of handing over the security to his own creditors, the same "pawn" passing through the hands of numberless creditors. By the Slave-dealing Proclamation of 1901 the buying, selling, or pawning of slaves is prohibited under heavy penalties. The system has been effectually abolished in the more settled districts, and is gradually being eradicated from those under less effective control. The Native House Rule Proclamation, 1901, provides for the maintenance of the authority, which is vested in Heads of Houses by Native law and Custom, over members of the House. The law enforces the submission of members to the Head of the House, and upon the latter the performance of those obligations towards the members which native law and custom imposes.

Means of Communication.

There is regular communication with Europe by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company. There is a fortnightly service between Liverpool and Forcados, Bonny and Calabar. The steamers leave Liverpool on alternate Saturdays, and call at Monrovia, Axim, Sekondi, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos. On the intervening Saturdays there is a service between Liverpool and Forcados. The time occupied in the voyage from Liverpool to Calabar is 20 days. These Companies also maintain intermediate services from London, Liverpool and Hamburg to Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, Brass, Akassa, Forcados, Warri, and Sapele.

Steamers of the German Woermann Line run from Calabar to Lagos in connection with that Company's Express Service between Lagos and Southampton. On the outward voyage there is no direct communication between Lagos and Calabar. Intermediate services are also maintained by the Woermann Line between Hamburg and the ports of the Protectorate.

The Niger is navigable to the Northern Nigeria Boundary for small ocean-going steamers during the months of June, July, August and September, and at other times for shallow-draught stern-wheel steamers and launches.

A regular system is maintained, for the conveyance of passengers and cargo at fixed rates, up and down the Niger River. The distance from Forcados (port of entry) to Idah, the Southern Nigeria boundary on the Niger, is 307 miles.

The Cross River is navigable up to and beyond the German boundary during the wet season by stern-wheel steamers and launches, but during the dry season mails and Government cargo can only be conveyed by means of canoes. The distance from Calabar to Ossingde beyond the German boundary is about 242 miles. A system of regular transport for passengers and cargo at fixed rates is maintained during the wet season.

Chief Towns.

Duke Town, or Calabar, on the river of the same name, is about 5 miles above its junction with the Cross River, and is the headquarters of the administration, with a population of about 15,000. Creek Town, 4 miles beyond, is also an important place, population about 5,000.

Near the mouth of the Opobo River is the town of the same name built by Ja Ja, and about 40 or 50 miles inland near the same river is Bende, a great Ju Ju centre. Bonny Town, 8 miles from the sea, on the left bank of the Bonny, is a station of the Church Missionary Society, and contains several European establishments. There is also a
European settlement at the mouth of the Brass, possessing a very fine church, presented by one of the native chiefs.

Benin City, some 60 miles up the river of the name, is a large town of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants. It was formerly the seat of a powerful theocracy of fetish priests, and famous for its human sacrifices. It was taken in 1897, in the circumstances stated below, and is now a thriving trading centre.

The trading station in Benin River is situated about 8 miles from the bar, lying open to the sea-breeze, though sand-flies and mosquitoes abound.

In Jan., 1897, a peaceful mission on its way to the King of Benin was massacred in the bush, and a force of native troops and bluejackets had to be sent to punish the Binis. The expedition was completely successful, the king's forces being defeated, and the king himself driven to take refuge in the bush. The king was afterwards captured, and is now in exile at Calabar.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling. A small importation of the Imperial bronze coinage has been made, but at present there appears to be no inclination on the part of the natives to adopt it, the circulation being extremely small.

The native currency of brass rods and manillas is accepted as legal tender in native markets in which they were current previous to the introduction of the Native Currency Proclamation (1902), the rates of exchange being for Brass Rods 4 to 1s., Atorine Manillas 16 to 1s., for Awirawu Manillas 6 to 1s., for Abbie or Prince Manillas, 12 to 1s., and Ama-Ogonio or Town Manillas, 24 to 1s., and for Perckule Manillas 4 to 1s. In the Calabar and Cross River districts there are also in circulation copper wires, known as "Citims," the rates of exchange being 20 to 3d. (one brass rod) or 80 to 1s. Cowries are still used as currency in some parts of the Protectorate, but further importation is prohibited, and the abolition of the native currency is being gradually effected.

Straits Settlements.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement, which now comprises also Labuan, Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 288 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 265 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed, by letters patent of 13th October, 1878, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent, dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by 3 mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. The population is 698. The boundaries of the Settlement of Singapore have been extended so as to include these islands.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 230 miles S.W. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., annexed in June, 1888, was placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889, and was formally annexed to the Settlement of Singapore in 1900. It is twelve miles long and five miles wide; wooded, and has about 1,200 inhabitants. There is a rich deposit of phosphate of lime on this island.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued to the existing Governor of the Straits Settlements in 1906, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, known as an important independent State from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken possession of by the English, and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally passed into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland of the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should leave the Malay Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch restrictions; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon (Puket or Tongkah), and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy
the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 288 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and coconuts. In 1806 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Native Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British, and the whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The old city of Singapore flourished and was destroyed in the 14th century. Thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. It was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated, in 1826, with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

**Constitution, Law, and Justice.**

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 9 official members and 7 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

**Climate.**

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1907 was 80°16' F.; in Penang, 80°3' F.; in Province Wellesley, 81°3' F.; and in Malacca, 79°9' F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 93°9' and 73°9' F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1898 to 1907, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 174 wet days; the average rainfall for the same period being 96°01 inches. In 1907 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 81°25 inches; in Penang 87°53 inches; in Province Wellesley 76°78 inches; in Malacca 71°35 inches; and in the Dindings 53°21 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have southeast, south or south-west winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.

**Population.**

At the census taken in April, 1891 and 1901, the population of the Settlements was ascertained to be as follows:

|                | 1891   | 1901   |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Singapore      | 184,554| 228,555|
| Penang, Province Wellesley, and Dindings | 235,618 | 258,207 |
| Malacca        | 92,170 | 95,487 |
| **Total**      | 512,342| 572,249|

The total at the census of 1866 was 273,000. " " 1871 " " 307,951. " " 1881 " " 423,384.

**Trade.**

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of 1 anna per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmeg, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gun, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, etc. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are tapioca and rice (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). The quantities of some of the exports in 1907 were approximately Coffee, 2,907 tons; gambier, 34,158 tons; principal gums, *36,963 tons; principal spices, 81,455 tons; tapioca, 39,465 tons; tin, 56,518 tons; copra, 56,771 tons; rattans, 27,696 tons; preserved pineapples, 845,976 cases; and sago, 59,244 tons. The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The quantities imported in 1907 were Cotton piece goods, 4,178,098 pieces; coal, 667,695 tons; rice 447,685 tons; opium, 13,714 chests; silk piece goods, 239,827 pieces; petroleum (cases of 65 lbs.), 1,243,153 cases; sarongs (cargoes of 20 pieces), 315,648 cargoes; fish (dry and salted), 49,731 tons; tobacco, 6,317 tons; tin ore, 57,198 tons; and wheat flour, 31,732 tons. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and the Native States. Singapore and Georgetown (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had, on the 31st December, 1907, 741 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 86,526 tons.

**Means of Communication.**

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe via Ceylon, and with China and Japan weekly by the P. and O., Messageries Maritimes; in addition there is a fortnightly service via

* Para Rubber, 2,000,000 lbs., included in gums.
India, and fortnightly by packets of the Norddeutscher-Lloyd and Hamburg-American Line, and the Steamship Company "Nederland" Line; and at frequent intervals by Holt's, East Asiatic, Austro-Hungary Lloyd's, British India, Glen, Japanese, and other lines; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla via Hong Kong and by Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok weekly by Norddeutscher-Lloyd and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Messageries Maritimes and Netherlands India Company's steamers; with Australian ports weekly, and otherwise by P. and O. and Messageries Maritimes, via Ceylon, by British India, China Navigation Company, and other lines; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, fortnightly by the Negapatam steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, British India, Apcar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and other ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, etc., by local lines; and the Norddeutscher-Lloyd has a large fleet of steamers running between Singapore and most of the neighbouring foreign ports.

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1907 to $1,964,199, the principal business done being with the United Kingdom, India, and the Native States.

There is telegraphic communication by 3 submarine cables from Penang to Madras, Malacca, and Singapore; and from Singapore there are 3 cables (1) to Saigon and Hong Kong, (2) to Labuan and Hong Kong, (3) to Saigon, Hué, Haiphong, Hainan, and Hong Kong. There is also a Government telegraph line from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Sungei-Ujong, and Malacca. A land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur is in course of construction, and it is expected that it will be open for traffic early in 1909. There are 174 miles of telegraph line, 13 miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley, and 3,111 miles of telephone line. There is a telephone exchange worked by the Oriental Telephone Company in Singapore, and two worked by the Post Office, one in Penang and the other in Province Wellesley. A railway, 23 miles long, connects Prai in Province Wellesley with the Perak railway system. A railway, 15 miles long, from the docks of Singapore to Kranji, on the Straits of Johore, constructed by the Colonial Government, is now open for traffic.

* See list at end of Introduction.

A railway connecting the town of Malacca with Pulau-Sebang, on the borders of Negri-Sembilan, has been opened for traffic as part of the Federated Malay States Railway system.

Education.

The expenditure on education is voted each year by the Legislative Council of the Colony. The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children in Malacca, Province Wellesley and Penang Island outside municipal limits. It is not compulsory in Singapore or Penang Town. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unsectarian. A reformatory for juvenile offenders and vagrants has been opened, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1907 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 7 | 2,442 | 2,285 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 30 | 8,351 | 7,455 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 173 | 11,142 | 9,064 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 3 | 97 | 79 |
| Total. | 213 | 22,032 | 18,883 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetized from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Committee were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the...
Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively. The half-dollar is now unlimited legal tender.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the International Banking Corporation, the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands Commercial Bank; the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank; National Bank of China, Ltd.; Kwong Yik Banking Company, Ltd.; and Sye Hai Thong Banking and Insurance Company.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes. The average amount of notes issued and in circulation in 1907 was $1,825,089.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the undermentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec. 1899—$3,920,000
" " " " 1900—$6,105,000
" " " " 1901—$9,178,000
" " " " 30th June, 1902—$12,305,900
" " " " 1903—$15,290,490
" " " " 1904—$17,102,490
" " " " 1905—$17,209,105
" " " " 31st August, 1906—$24,786,105
" " " " 1907—$26,974,555
" " " " 31st July, 1908—$22,331,705

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in British North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1907, the deposits amounted to $598,591.

A scheme was in 1902 drawn up for placing the salaries of the higher officers in the service of the S.S. and Federated Malay States Governments on a sterling basis from 1st January, 1903. Existing higher officers had the option of accepting a salary in sterling (to be paid in dollars locally according to a monthly rate of exchange), or in the alternative, continue to draw their dollar salary together with exchange compensation, i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar = 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave pay and pension at home. From 1907 a local allowance of 10 per cent. was sanctioned temporarily for three years to the same officers.

The native Weights are:—

1 kati = 16 tahil = 1¼ lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 533¾ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipal Boards at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, the members of which are partly elected by the ratepayers and partly nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1907 was $3,301,304; and the expenditure $3,218,022.
