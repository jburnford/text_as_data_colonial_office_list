GIBRALTAR.

Situation and Area.

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat. 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long high mountain called "The Rock," and a very flat sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, and called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,439 feet, its length 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¾ of a mile. Its area is 1½ square miles.

History.

The rock of Gibraltar, the Mons Calpe of the ancients, remained under the dominion of the Moors until the 15th century, when it was incorporated with the Spanish kingdom of Granada. It was captured by the British forces under Sir George Rooke, 24th July, 1704, and was ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Treaty of Utrecht was renewed by Article 2 of Treaty of Versailles, 1783. It was successfully defended by Gen. Eliot (afterwards Lord Heathfield) in the great siege of 1779-83.

General Description.

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called the Bay of Gibraltar, which is about 4 or 5 miles across, and affords good anchorage for the shipping passing through the Straits. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock are an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea and the sandy plain known as the North Front, which lies between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Línea; from the northern end the Rock runs along southward like a knife edge to the ancient site of O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind these latter lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only ¾ of a mile. It is one of the most thickly inhabited places in the world, but it is not unhealthy. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden, called the Alameda. The civil population in the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south-east of the New Mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being entirely taken up with barracks, hospitals, &c., for the Military and the Navy.

Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and coaling station by shipping, and it is also an entrepot of the trade between England and the Arabian states of Northern Africa, for which it has many advantages, having been ever since its occupation by the British a free port, or practically so. The construction of the three graving docks is completed.

The northern end of the harbour is enclosed by a mole, built at the joint cost of the Imperial Government and the local revenue, by which greatly increased facilities for landing and shipping cargo will be afforded.

About 450 persons are employed in tobacco manufactories, and about 1,200 in the coal depôts. It is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1907, 41 vessels, of together 5,411 tons (gross). No statistics of imports or exports are taken, except of wine, spirits, beer and tobacco.

The revenue is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, duties upon wine, spirits, beer, and tobacco, and licence duties and fees.

There is no executive council nor any legislative body. The Governor, who is also the General commanding the garrison, exercises by himself all the functions of government and legislation. The management of the drainage, water supply, &c., is in the hands of a nominated body, called the Sanitary Commissioners. Their receipts for 1907 were 51,801l., their expenditure 65,919l., and their debt, on the 31st of Dec., 1907, 244,624l.

There is a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, and several private bankers.

A Government savings bank was founded in 1882, and had on 31st Dec., 1907, Ps. 821,322, and 91,365l., deposited by 3,861 depositors. Since the 1st Oct., 1898, the legal tender currency has been that of the United Kingdom, and the public accounts are now kept in it, but Spanish money is still freely current. The change from Spanish currency, which had previously been the legal tender, was effected under the provisions of the Orders in Council of the 9th of August, 1898.

There is daily postal communication with England by way of Spain and France. Rates of postage: Letters, ½d. per oz.; newspapers, ¼d. The internal postage rate is ½d. per ½ oz. Also direct telegraphic communication with Spain, and by cables to Tangier, Malta, Lisbon, and Cadiz.

THE GOLD COAST.

(See Map under head of Southern Nigeria.)

THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast Colony, with Ashanti and the Protected Northern Territories, is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, between 3° 7' W. long. and 1° 14' E. long., and is bounded on the west by the French colony of the Ivory Coast, on the east by the German colony of Togoland, on the north by the French Soudan, and on the south by the sea.

The area of the Colony is 24,200 square miles, of Ashanti, 20,000, and of the Northern Territories, 35,800.

The country is inhabited by a large number of native tribes more or less independent of each other, but with similar customs and forms of government. Each tribe has its own head chief and every town or village of the tribe a chief.

The chiefs and sub-chiefs form the council of the tribe, and assist in dealing with matters affecting its general welfare. The succession both to the king's and chiefs' stools is for the most part hereditary by the female side, the heir to the stool being the son of the occupant's eldest sister, or failing male offspring by his sisters, his brothers according to seniority, and back from them to the male offspring of his aunts on the father's side.

The principal coast tribes are the following:—Appollonia, Ahanta, Chiana, Kommanda, Elmina, Cape Coast or Fanti, Winneba, Assin Gomoa, Accra, Adangme, Awuna, Agbosome and Afao. Some of these, on account of tribal differences, are split up into divisions more or less independent of each other, and as education and civilisation spread, a tendency to further disintegration develops itself.

In the interior the principal tribes are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wassaw, Setwi, upper and lower Denkera, Tufel, Assen, Esikuma, Ajumako, Akim Almakwa, and Akim Kotoku, Akwapim, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepi, Shai, Ningo, Kriko.
For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into three provinces, each presided over by a Provincial Commissioner. These Provinces are further divided into districts, presided over by District Commissioners. All these Officers not only perform judicial duties as magistrates, but also are in administrative charge of their district. The districts are as follows:

1. Western province:—Districts—Western Frontier, Axim, Ankobra, Tarkwa, Sekondi-Dixcove.
2. Central province:—Districts—Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winneba.
3. Eastern province:—Districts—Accra, Birrim, Akwapim, Volta River, Ada, Kwitta.

History.

The Gold Coast, with the adjacent territories bordering on the Gulf of Guinea, first became known to Europeans by the enterprise of Portuguese and French navigators in the 14th century. The first European Settlement on the Gold Coast was in 1482, when the fort San Jorge da Mina (Elmina) was built and garrisoned by the Portuguese, who subsequently made several other settlements, and obtained Papal authority for their occupation of the country. During the reign of Elizabeth of England, the Dutch established themselves on the coast, and their rivalry was so successful that they eventually terminated the Portuguese occupation by the capture of Elmina in 1637, and of Fort Anthony at Axim in 1642. The first English Expeditions to the Coast were made in the reign of Edward I., but were all of the nature of private ventures. The "Company of Adventurers of London trading into Africa" incorporated in 1618, led to the establishment of the first British Settlement at Kormantine. A second company was formed in 1626, and a third in 1662, and settlements were made at Cape Corso (Cape Coast), Anomabo, and Accra, the main object of these companies, as well as those of the other European nations, being traffic in slaves. Three other European nations succeeded in acquiring territories on the Gold Coast, viz.:—The Swedes, the Brandenburghers, and the Danes. The first-mentioned built the fort of Christiansborg, near Accra about 1645, but were driven out by the Danes in 1657, and retired from the Coast. The Brandenburghers established "Fort Great Fredericksburg" at Princes River in 1682, and "Fort Dorothea" at Akwada in 1685, but their enterprise does not seem to have been prosecuted with much vigour, and was finally abandoned in 1720, their possessions falling into the hands of the Dutch. The Danes, however, after first selling the Fort at Christiansborg to the Portuguese, and re-buying it three years later, rapidly improved their position, building forts at several stations to the East of Accra, as far as Ada and Kwitta, and exercising a kind of Protectorate over Akwapem, and the Volta River district.

The third English Company was not successful. The Dutch traders spared no efforts to get rid of their rivals, and in consequence of their aggression, an expedition was sent by Charles II. in 1663, under the command of Captain Holmes, which recaptured Cape Coast, taken a few years previously by the Dutch, and all the other Dutch forts, with the exception of Elmina and Axim. In the following year, however, the Dutch Commander de Ruyter recaptured all the lost Dutch forts, with the exception of Cape Coast; and the treaty of Breda, 1667, left affairs in the Gold Coast in this condition. The fourth English Company was incorporated in the year 1672 under the name of the "Royal African Company of England." Under its influence English interests steadily advanced, and forts were established at Dixcove, Sekondi, Kommanda, Anamabu, Tantumkwieri, Winneba, Accra. The abolition of the exclusive privileges which the Royal African Company enjoyed, led to its decline and eventual dissolution in 1752. By the Acts of Parliament 22 George II., c. 31, and 25 George II., c. 40, a fifth trading Corporation, called the "African Company of Merchants," was formed, the membership of which was open to all British traders on payment of a fee of 40l., compensation being paid for its charter, and property to the Royal African Company. An annual subsidy was granted by Parliament to the newly-formed Company, until 1821, when by the Act 1 & 2 George IV., c. 28, the Company was dissolved and its possessions vested in the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlement, the seat of government being at Sierra Leone.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fanti in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fanti against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Ensimankao, where, on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowa, near Accra, in 1827. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831, between the English, the Fanti, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only 4,000l. a year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his Government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the slave trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, and a Lieutenant-Governor appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of native affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

Hitherto the forts of the various nations were intermixed with each other, and there was no defined limit as to where the influence of one or the other began or ended. The imposition of Customs duties was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by the existence of the free ports of a rival nation within a stone's throw, as it were, of the duty ports. On the 24th of January, 1850, by Letters Patent, the Settlements on the Gold Coast ceased to be dependencies of Sierra Leone, and in the same year, by the purchase of the forts and protectorate of the Danes, the Coast line from Christiansborg to Kwitta and the districts of Shai, eastern and western Krobo, Akwapim, Akwamu, and Krepé, were acquired by England. By a Commission dated the 19th February, 1861, the Gold Coast Settlements were reunited to the Colony of Sierra Leone under one Governor-in-Chief. In 1867, a
convention was made with the Dutch by which the portion of the Coast lying to the west of the Sweet River, which flows into the sea between Cape Coast and Elmina, was allotted to Holland, England taking all the territory to the east of the river, and a customs union between the two nations was established. The Dutch, however, found many difficulties in the way of their occupation of the forts and possessions received from the English in exchange for those of their own lying to the East of the boundary line. The native tribes refused to recognise their authority, and the prospect before them was that of a long series of petty wars with no reasonable hope of profit to be gained in the future. The result was the convention made between England and Holland in 1871, by which the Dutch transferred all their forts and possessions on the Coast to the English, and Great Britain obtained at last the sole sovereignty and control of the territory from Axim to the Volta. The forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872. The present extent and limits of the colony are defined in the Order in Council of 1906.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by Letters Patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument Lagos was separated from the Gold Coast and formed into a distinct colony. Provision was made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Four unofficial members have been appointed to the Legislative Council.

The Supreme Court of the Colony was a Court of Appeal for Lagos, and also under the West African Order in Council, 1884, but legislation providing for the establishment of separate courts of appeal in each colony was passed in 1888.

**Law and Justice.**

The Law of the Colony is the Common law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application in force in England, on the 24th July, 1874, modified by a large number of Local Ordinances passed at various periods since that date. The Criminal Law was codified in 1892, and civil and criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Ordinance passed in 1876.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court presided over by the Chief Justice, Divisional Courts held in different parts of the colony by three puisne judges, and thirteen inferior Courts with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction presided over by District Commissioners. The Supreme Court has an original civil and criminal jurisdiction, and decides appeals from the inferior courts in civil matters, while the Chief Justice has a power of revision of the decisions of the Commissioners in criminal cases. Appeals from Divisional Courts are heard by a full court.

Native law is administered in all the Courts, in as far as it is not incompatible with any Statute or Ordinance, and not repugnant to natural justice.

The Forts of St. James at Accra, St. Jago at Elmina, and Cape Coast Castle are utilised as prisons, and a central prison has been constructed at Sekondi.

At Accra and Sekondi convicts are taught trades, remunerative industries are carried on, and the English penal system is carried out in a modified form.

**Climate.**

The climate is very unhealthy, especially for Europeans. The death rate among the non-official European population is difficult to ascertain, but the rate per 1,000 is believed to have been 14·22 in 1905, 13·0 in 1906, and 14·59 in 1907. Among the European officials the death rate per 1,000 was 23·19 in 1905, 15·0 in 1906, and 8·10 in 1907. No data are at hand for estimating the death rate among the natives. Infant mortality is great. The mean temperature in the shade at Accra averages 78·6 F., and was 77·6 in 1907. The average annual rainfall at the same place is about 26 inches, and was 36·67 in 1907. The rainfall varies with the physical configuration of the country, and is very great in Axim and the mining districts of Tarkwa, Upper and Lower Wassaw, etc. The "first rains," or rainy season proper, begin in March and end in July; the "latter rains" are spread over the months of September and October. The Harmattan season begins in December and ends in February. It is characterised by a cool wind which is sometimes dry and bracing, but often moist, and then very depressing. The climate generally is hot and moist, and very malarious.

**Domestic Slavery.**

Domestic slavery existed from time immemorial on the Gold Coast, as in other parts of Africa. The slave population consisting partly of native-born slaves, and partly of Donkos, slaves purchased from Ashanti importers. Slavery was mainly an emanation of parental authority, every man being saleable either by his father or mother, according to the character of the union subsisting between his parents, and the consequent status of the mother; but there was also a species of slavery called pawning, founded on contract, which arose when a debtor gave to his creditor, as a security, either himself, or a child or slave, to be a temporary slave in the hands of the creditor until debt and interest were paid.

Within the British possessions on the Gold Coast, slavery was abolished by force of the statute 3 & 4 Will. IV., c.73, but no attempt had been made to deal with it in the Protectorate, which was not affected by that statute. The harsher usages of slavery were, however, appreciably mitigated by the action of the court of the "Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs" and other magistrates. At the conclusion of the war of 1873-4 the question was taken in hand anew by the newly-established Legislative Council at its first meeting, and settled by two ordinances. One of these prohibits, under penalties, the introduction of slaves into the Protectorate, and the buying and selling, and pawning of slaves and other persons within the Protectorate; and the second declares, that henceforth no court, native or British, shall take notice of, so as to give effect to, the relations between master and slave, except in so far as those relations may be in accordance with the law of England relating to master and servant.
MAIL AND STEAMSHIP SERVICES.

The British and African Steam Navigation Co. (1888), Ltd., and African Steamship Company.

Mail steamers of these companies leave Liverpool every Saturday calling at Axim, Sekondi, Cape Coast and Accra, the length of the voyage being 14 to 15 days.

These companies also despatch cargo steamers every alternate Wednesday and fourth Thursday from Liverpool, the Wednesday steamers calling at the principal Gold Coast ports and the Thursday steamers at all Gold Coast ports outwards and homewards. Length of the voyage, Liverpool to Accra, varies from 30 to 37 days.

On the 15th of each month a steamer leaves Hamburg and calls at the principal Gold Coast ports, length of voyage being about 30 days.

Homewards, the mail steamers of these companies call at Accra every Tuesday, also calling at Cape Coast, Sekondi and Axim, except the South Coast steamers, which do not call at Cape Coast. The length of the voyage, Accra to Plymouth, by these steamers is 17 days.

The steamers of these companies call at the Canary Islands or Madeira homewards.

Woermann Line.

A mail steamer of this line outwards from Hamburg calls at Dover on 11th of each month for passengers for the principal Gold Coast ports, length of the voyage, Dover to Accra, being 16 days. Cargo steamers of this line leave Hamburg on 1st, 7th, 20th and 22nd of each month, calling at most ports on the Gold Coast, the voyage to Accra varying from 25 to 32 days.

One of this Company's steamers leaves Accra on 14th of each month homewards, calling at Sekondi for mails and passengers, the voyage, Accra to Southampton, taking about 16 days.

Cargo steamers of one or two French Companies sailing from Marseilles call irregularly outwards and homewards at Gold Coast ports.

Note: The above steamship services are liable to frequent changes.

INTERNAL COMMUNICATION.

The construction of a railway from Sekondi to Tarkwa, a distance of about 40 miles, was commenced in February, 1898. The rails reached Tarkwa on the 17th April, 1901, and in July of that year an extension was started from that point, the lines reaching Obosie (124 miles) by the end of 1902, and Kumasi on 1st October, 1903. The receipts were £3,435/£ in 1901, £9,438/£ in 1902, £5,965/£ in 1903, £48,097/£ in 1904, £32,752/£ in 1905, and £17,529/£ in 1906. The construction of a railway between Accra and Akwapim has been commenced.

The roads in the Colony that are maintained by the Department of Public Works are as follows:

In the Western Province.—Axim to the Anoobra River, 4 miles; Tamsu to Cinnamon Pipo through Tarkwa, 11½ miles. In the Central Province.—Cape Coast to Anamabu, 9½ miles; Cape Coast to Elmina, 8 miles; Cape Coast to Jukwa, 14½ miles; Cape Coast to Prahus, 72 miles; Saltpond to Besese, 19 miles; Winneba to Nasaba, 21 miles. In the Eastern Province.—Accra to Aburi, 25½ miles; with a branch road to Dodowa, 13½ miles. A trunk road is being made from Kumasi to Tamale.

In addition to these there are numerous native roads, which are kept clear of bush and passable for trailers and travellers by the local chiefs, who are paid by the Government for this purpose 10s. a quarter per mile. Of these the most worthy of mention are the road from Aburi through Apasare and Kofrodua to Osino, the Western frontier road, running through Aowin and Sefwi to Wam and British Gaman; the road from Cape Coast to Asafo and Debiso, via Mampong; the roads from Saltpond, Appam and Winneba to Nsuaem in Western Akim; the roads from Aburi, through Akwapim and Krobo, to Akuse and Pong. A road has also been constructed from Accra to Kibi by the Eastern Akim Gold Fields Co., with assistance from the Government. Kumasi is the centre for the various routes to the Northern District. From it roads lead to Gambaga, via Kintampo, to Yeji and Prang, via Attabubu, to Wam and British Gaman, via Odumase and Berekum, and to Ahafo. It is also connected with the districts of the Colony by roads running into Sefwi and Akim, as well as by the Cape Coast road mentioned above. Where rivers and swamps have to be crossed, ferries have been instituted, which are controlled for the most part by the Chiefs, who are empowered to levy a small fee. In some cases, where this arrangement has not given satisfaction, ferries are worked under direct Government supervision.

The principal waterway is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and flows into the sea at Ada, after a course of 200 miles. It is navigable for light draught launches as far as Akuse, and, with the exception of the Krachi rapids, can be used for canoe traffic during certain seasons of the year as far as Yeji. The Ankobra River has been largely used for transport purposes to the mines in the Prestea and Hinman Districts, and is navigable for many months of the year by surf boats and light draught launches for a distance of 50 miles. The Tano, connected with Half Assini, by the main lagoon, and by a tramway, three miles in length, is navigable for light draught launches and canoes as far as Tamoso, a distance of about 60 miles. Rapids at Atakwabo prevent this river being further utilised.

There is no harbour along the whole coast of the Colony, and passengers and goods are landed in surf-boats. A breakwater at Accra is, however, in course of construction, and will probably be completed in 1909.

The best landings are at Dixcove, Axim and Sekondi, while the surf is most dangerous at Ada, Saltpond, and the Apollonia Coast.

A Transport Department is established at Sekondi and Kumasi, under the direction of the Government. Arrangements can be made for the conveyance of goods and mining material to any part of the Colony by this Department at a fixed tariff.

POSTAL COMMUNICATION.

The Colony is included in the Postal Union. Foreign money order and parcel post systems are in operation between it and the United Kingdom, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Lagos, and Southern and Northern Nigeria. An inland postal order system is in existence. A tri-weekly postal service is maintained between all the principal Coast stations and by rail between Sekondi and Kumasi; a weekly service between Kumasi and Kintampo and Gambaga, and between Kumasi, Attabubu, and Salaga in the Northern Territories; between the Colony and the French Ivory Coast;
and a bi-weekly service between the Colony and the German protectorate of Togoland. Foreign Money Order and Parcel Post Systems are in operation between it and the United Kingdom, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Southern and Northern Nigeria. From 1st Oct., 1904, there came into circulation British Postal Orders for every complete 6d. up to 20s., and also for 21s. These orders are negotiable in Great Britain and in certain British Colonies. They are also used for inland remittances. A tri-weekly postal service is maintained between Accra and the Leeward Districts, and a bi-weekly between the Windwards; there is also a service between Sekondi and the railway stations to Kumasi, and a weekly service between Kumasi and the Northern Territories. The number of letters, etc., posted and received in 1907 was 3,408,567.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| For Newspapers, Books, Printed Papers, per 2 oz. | 1d. | ½d. | ¼d. |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|

There is a direct Parcel Post Service between the Colony and Germany; the rate of postage being 2s. for any parcel not weighing over 11 lbs. There is also a local parcel post.

The Cash on Delivery Service on parcels, insured letters and registered packets exchanged between certain places in the Gold Coast Colony and the United Kingdom, Egypt, and certain British Possessions, was introduced on the 1st Sept., 1908.

A special fee of 3d. is charged on every parcel, letter or packet posted in the Gold Coast Colony under this service, and on every such parcel, letter, or packet delivered in the Colony the following fees are charged:—When the trade charge does not exceed 2½d., 6d.; when the trade charge exceeds 2½d. but does not exceed 5½d., 9d.; when the trade charge exceeds 5½d. but does not exceed 10½d., 1s.

British postal orders are issued and paid in the Colony.

Telegraphs and Telephones.

Telegraphs were first introduced in 1882, when a line 2½ miles in length was constructed between Accra and Christiansborg. This was in 1885 extended to Aburi, distant 25 miles. A line was next constructed along the coast from Accra to Axim, a distance of 180 miles, with intermediate stations at Winneba, Appam, Saltpond, Anamalu, Cape Coast, Elmina, Chama, Sekondi, Ajua, and Dixcove. This has been duplicated, and in 1902 the system was extended from Axim to the French boundary at Newtown. Another line of about 114 miles in length extends from Accra to the Anglo-German frontier, where it joins the line of the German settlement of Togoland, with intermediate stations at Pram Pram, Ada, Kwitta, and Denu. A third line strikes inland from Ada, and connects the towns of Akuse and Kpong, on the River Volta. A fourth line has been constructed through the interior, to Nkoranza in Ashanti, starting at Cape Coast, with intermediate stations at Manso, Prahas, Kwissa and Kumasi. From Nkoranza, three lines have been run, one reaching as far as Wa, with intermediate stations at Kintampo and Bole; a second to Jamale, with intermediate stations at Attabulu, Yeji and Salaga, and a third to Sunyani. A fifth line runs along the railway from Sekondi to Kumasi, with intermediate stations at Tarkwa, Abosso, Dunkwa, Obuase and Akrokerri. It is connected with Kwissa from Obuase. A sixth line has been constructed connecting Accra with Kpong via Almena, Aburi and Akropong. From this there is a branch line to Dodowa. The total length of lines constructed is, so far, 1,129 miles.

The number of telegrams forwarded was, in 1906, 218,421, and in 1907, 254,190. There are tele-phone exchanges at Accra, Cape Coast, Sekondi and Tarkwa.

Accra and Sekondi are in telegraphic communication with Europe—vid Sierra Leone, St. Vincent, and Madeira—with Lagos, Brass, Bonny, Camerons, and St. Thomas. They are also connected with the Cape, vid Loanda and Mossamedes, and vid Sierra Leone, Ascension and St. Helena.

Education.

Elementary education in the Colony is chiefly in the hands of the Wesleyan, Basel, Roman Catholic and Bremen Missionary Societies; these receive annual grants from the Government. The Government has established schools at Accra, Cape Coast, and Nsuaem, in Western Akim; there is also a Government school at Accra in connection with the Civil Police force. The various missions have schools situated in outlying districts, reaching far into the interior. A scheme of technical education has been introduced into the Government schools at Accra and Cape Coast, and many of the mission schools in the interior have small plantations attached, where the scholars receive instruction in the cultivation of cocoa, rubber, cotton, coffee and other native products. The Basel Mission has also established training schools for their teachers at Akropong and Abetifi, and at their head stations instruction is given in carpentry, masonry, book binding, and various other crafts. At the Roman Catholic mission school, Cape Coast, a printing press has been set up, and the senior scholars receive regular instruction in the art of printing.

A Government training institution for teachers is being built in Accra, and provision has been made in the 1909 estimates for the staff. A Government technical school, in which several trades will be taught, is now approaching completion, and early in 1909 work will be commenced under the superintendence of two European instructors.

In addition there are about 220 other schools which do not receive financial support from the Government.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling, with Spanish, American, and French gold coins, as fixed by Ordinance No. 2 of 1889. Gold dust was demonetised by Ordinance No. 9 of 1889, but still remains a medium of exchange in the districts of the interior. A number of United States silver half-dollars are in circulation, but are not legal tender. German gold and silver coins circulate in the Trans-Volta districts since the Customs Union. Copper coins are being gradually introduced through the agency of the native chiefs. Cowries are still in use, but only for the purchase of articles of little value. Accounts are kept in sterling. The Bank of British West Africa has establishments at Accra, Cape Coast, Sekondi, Axim and Kumasi. It commenced business at those places on the 1st January, 1897, 22nd January, 1900, 1st July, 1901, 21st October, 1901, and 1st October, 1907, respectively. In March, 1888, a Government savings bank was established, and had, on the 31st December, 1901, a credit of £3,956. 0s. 8d., in the names of 341 depositors. The Savings Bank was transferred to the Post Office in 1905, and on the 31st December, 1907, there were depositors. The deposits during 1907 amounted to £14,849. 8s. 6d., and the amount to the credit of depositors on the 31st December was £15,036. 6s. 1d. Penny Banks have also been established in the principal schools. The rate of exchange is at par.

Population.

The census returns for 1901 give the population of the Colony as 885,350; but the Census Committee estimated that, owing to the difficulty in obtaining information in the interior of the Colony, and the reluctance on the part of the natives to be enumerated, an addition of 148,000 should be made, thus bringing the total to 1,043,350. The returns for Ashanti give 335,651, and for the Northern Territories 317,964. The populations of the chief towns on the coast are Accra, 17,892; Cape Coast Castle, 28,948; Ada, 13,240; Sekondi, 4,095; Kwitta, 3,018; and Axim, 2,189.

Trade and Industries.

The chief products of the Colony are palm oil, rubber, palm kernels, lumber, cocoa, kola and gold. Palm oil is used chiefly in the manufacture of soap and candles, and though for this reason its value fluctuates to some extent with the tallow market, the average value of the exports of this article is consistently high. The Volta River District is the most important centre for palm oil, on account of the facilities afforded by the river for transport to the coast. The oil is packed in casks, rolled to the river, towed by canoes to Akuse, and thence by launches to Adda for shipment to Europe. In other parts of the country the casks are rolled along the road to the nearest sea-port. The value of the palm oil exported in 1907 was £119,468. The average value for the ten years previous to 1907 was £154,544.

The value of rubber exports has fluctuated in the last few years. There are several reasons to account for this—viz., the low prices ruling in the European markets, the destruction of trees by unskilful tapping, the fact that rubber from the adjoining French and German Colonies no longer comes to Gold Coast ports, and the fact that a more profitable field for labour is offered by the numerous mining enterprises, a cause which has affected all staple products. Between 1891 and 1901 rubber was the most important export of the Colony, the value for 1899 amounting to £55,731/., and the average for the decade being £321,165/. In 1902, although 5½ more rubber was exported than in the previous year, the value was 15½ less. The value of this export rose to £196,500/., in 1903, which represents an increase of 100½ on the preceding year, although the increase in the amount shipped was less than 50½. In 1904, however, 4,013,837 lbs. of rubber, valued at £300,644/., was exported. This was probably due to the opening up of hitherto untapped districts in Ashanti, and the impetus given to the trade there by the completion of the railway and the enterprise of various European firms who have recently established trading depots in Kumasi. 15,000 trees have been
planted by the Botanical Department in forest land recently acquired by Government, and efforts are being made to instruct the natives in more scientific methods of tapping the trees and preparing the rubber for the market.

The value of the kernels exported in 1907 was £101,822.

The lumber trade is not as yet on a very sound basis. The value of the mahogany timber exported rose from £4, in 1886, to £110,331, in 1898, but had fallen in 1902 to £21,896, rose in 1903 to £48,853, and again in 1904 to £54,295. In 1907 the value of the exports rose to £169,458. This was mainly due to better prices and increased railway facilities in the Colony.

The cultivation of cocoa was started in Akwapim in 1879, and the first exports in 1891 realised £4. Coffee at that time fetched a fair price, and it was not until 1898, when the price for the latter article fell so low as to make its cultivation at any distance from the coast unremunerative, that attention was paid to cocoa. Since that year the cocoa industry has made rapid strides. In 1900 the value exported was £27,280, in 1905, £86,809; in 1906, £36,269; and in 1907, £515,089.

The trade in kola nuts, which suffered greatly during the Ashanti disturbances, has since showed a steady increase. The tree is found principally in Ashanti and Akim, and the largest markets are at Bontoku (in French Territory), Kintampo, Salaga, and Pong, whence the kola nut is conveyed by caravans to the Hausa States in the Hinterland. Returns are not available for the amount of kola exported by these routes. Good trees have recently been planted by the Botanical Department, and increased attention is paid to its cultivation by the natives. The value of this product, exported by sea, amounted to £73,632, in 1906, and to £78,901, in 1907.

Gold has been exported from the Gold Coast more or less continuously since the discovery of the country by Europeans in the fifteenth century. Up to 1874, however, the industry was almost entirely in the hands of the natives. The first company for gold mining in West Africa was founded in 1874, but did little beyond exploration. A second company, formed in 1879, engaged in mining operations in the neighbourhood of Tarkwa, and from that year the progress of mining enterprise is indicated by the rapid increase in the exports of gold bars, the result of European operations, as compared with those of gold dust, the produce of native mining. In 1899 there was a very remarkable development of the mining industry, which, though checked for a while by the disturbances in Ashanti, received a fresh impetus from the passing of the Concessions Ordinance in 1900, the progress of the railway, and general improvement in means of transport. The amount of gold exported in 1905, viz., £596,583, was greatly in excess of any previous year. The average for the ten years prior to 1903 was £69,058. The number of companies holding concessions is 61.

Gold is widely diffused throughout the Colony, Ashanti, and some parts of the Northern Territories, in quartz deposits and alluvial deposits, while in Wassaw there is good conglomerate or banket formation. The rivers are said to be rich in alluvial deposits. Bitumen is found along the banks of the river Bonni, in Apollonia, and the stream Akyikyiri, flowing into the Ewiano lagoon near Half Assini. About three-quarters of the total export is with the United Kingdom, the rest being chiefly with Germany, France and Holland. The values of the principal exports for 1907 were:

| Articles, 1907 | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Cocoa         | £515,089 |
| Kola Nuts     | 78,901 |
| Gold and Gold Dust | 1,130,995 |
| Lumber        | 109,458 |
| Palm Kernels  | 101,822 |
| Palm Oil      | 119,468 |
| Rubber        | 333,120 |
| Other Articles| 53,234 |
| British, Foreign and other Colonial Produce and Manufactures and Specie | 139,607 |

£2,641,674

Up to the year 1894 the exports of the Colony exceeded the imports. From 1894 to 1906, however, the imports were greater than the exports. In 1907 the value of the exports exceeded that of the imports. The United Kingdom holds the bulk of the import trade with 70%; Germany is second with 11%. The first in value of the imports are cotton goods, with provisions second, and wines and spirits third. The imports of machinery have improved in the last few years with the advance of the mining enterprise. The majority of the imports are subject to an ad valorem duty of 10%. Specific duties are imposed on a few articles, such as spirits, tobacco, gunpowder, &c. The Customs receipts come to more than three-quarters the total revenue of the Colony.

Native manufactures are insignificant. Clothes are woven in many parts of the country, for the most part of English spun yarn, but in the northern districts occasionally of thread manufactured from the indigenous cotton plant. Narrow strips of four to six inches are woven on a rough hand loom, and stitched together to make clothes of various sizes. Gold and brass are worked by native smiths; canoes are made on the coast rivers; pottery for domestic purposes is made by hand, and wood-carving is done chiefly in Ashanti and Kwahu. Salt is roughly prepared from the lagoons between Accra and Kwitta, and sent up country to the markets of the Northern Territories. Fishing is extensively carried on along the coast, and large quantities of sun-dried fish are sent to the villages and markets of the interior.

Agriculture is the staple occupation of the interior. The chief food crops are yam, cassava, maize, plantain, and, in some districts, rice. The soil is very productive, and the methods of cultivation crude. In April, 1890, an Agricultural Station was established at Aburi, where the Government Sanatorium stands, at an elevation of 1,600 feet above sea level, and a Curator from the Royal Gardens, Kew, appointed, the object in view being to teach the natives the most approved methods of planting, and preparing their produce for the home markets. Forty-four acres were acquired for this purpose, and these were divided into plots and planted with rubber, kola, coffee fibres, cotton, cocoa, spices, vanillas, peppers, timber trees and various other ornamental and economic plants. Plant shelters were made to raise seedling plants, and these now cover an area of more than an acre. Thousands of plants are raised annually and distributed to
European and native planters. In 1900 an Assistant Curator was appointed, and the Curator sent to various parts of the Colony to instruct the natives in the proper methods of cultivation of rubber, cocoa, &c. Hundreds of cocoa plantations were formed in different parts of the country, and the success of this enterprise has greatly increased the influence of the Botanical Department by winning the confidence of the native planter. A bronze medal was received from the Paris Exhibition in 1900 for cocoa grown and cured at the Botanic Garden, Aburi. At Christiansborg 8,000 coconuts have been planted, to encourage the natives in the cultivation of this palm, for the production of copra and coir. An exchange seed list was established in 1900, and has been the means of the introduction of hundreds of valuable plants into the Colony. To increase the native interest in agriculture, instruction, both theoretical and practical, is given to school teachers, and a grant paid to schools which have a plot of land attached which is used for giving instruction in agriculture. There is a Director of Agriculture. Agricultural Stations for the cultivation of plants and trees of economic value have been established, with a Curator-in-charge, at Tarkwa and Coomassie, and a station has been established in the vicinity of Cape Coast. The Gold Coast also is one of the West African Colonies which receive an annual visit from the Inspector for Agriculture of British West Africa.
