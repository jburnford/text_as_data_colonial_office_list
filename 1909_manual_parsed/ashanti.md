ASHANTI.

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwais, Adamsis, Kokofus, Nkwantas, Kumasis, Agunas, Mampons, Nsutas, Kunawus, Bompatas, Jualons and Jisus. Each tribe has its own king, but from time immemorial the King of Coomassie was recognised as the King paramount of the Confederation. As King paramount, he succeeded to what was known as the "golden stool," the ceremony of enstoolment lasting several weeks, and being observed by the performance of native customs, which in times past consisted largely in the sacrifice of slaves.

In 1873 the King of Ashanti invaded the British Protectorate with a large army, and reached Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the British forces under Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing. Later in the year Captain (afterwards Sir) John Glover was sent to the eastern districts of the Protectorate to organise the tribes in that quarter, for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, now Viscount, Wolseley was despatched to the Gold Coast, with British and West Indian troops, native levies, and some seamen and marines, to operate against the Ashantis, starting from Cape Coast. On the 31st of January, 1874, he came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoafu, where, after desperate resistance, he drove them from their position. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Coomassie. The King had fled to the bush. A few days later Sir John Glover also reached Coomassie. On the 13th, messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fommanah, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Kofi. By the Treaty of Fommanah, the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold.

In 1894 Prempeh, who was then King of Coomassie, and had successfully fought against the Nkoranzas, who had revolted against his rule, threatened to attack the Atabubus. This attack was averted by the despatch of a force under Sir Francis Scott, and an ultimatum was then sent to Prempeh warning him not to enter British territory, and suggesting that he should acquiesce in the establishment of a Residency at Coomassie. No definite reply to this suggestion could be obtained, and a military expedition accordingly proceeded to Coomassie, to compel compliance with the demands of Her Majesty's Government. The expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Scott, entered Coomassie without resistance, January, 1896. Prempeh made submission, but, failing to comply with the terms dictated, was brought to the coast as a political prisoner and lodged in Elmina Castle. A Resident was at the same time installed at Coomassie, and thus commenced an entirely new departure in the relations of the Gold Coast Colony with Ashanti.

In 1900 the Governor visited Coomassie, and was there besieged by the Ashantis, the town being closely invested. Provisions ran short, and a part of the garrison, with the Governor, cut their way out; the rest were relieved by Colonel (afterwards Sir J.) Willoccks, commanding the Ashanti Field Force, on 15th July, after severe fighting. The Ashantis were subsequently thoroughly routed at Obassa.

An Order of the King in Council, dated September 26th, 1901, defined the boundaries of Ashanti, annexed it to His Majesty's Dominions, and provided for its administration under the Government of the Gold Coast. Ashanti is under a Chief Commissioner, with Commissioners of Provinces and Districts under him. By a subsequent Order in Council of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Colony and Ashanti, and between Ashanti and the Northern Territories, were re-adjusted and defined, with due regard to tribal lands and natural features. The provinces of Ashanti are called Central, Southern, Western and Northern, and have head-quarters at Coomassie, Obuasi, Sunyani and Kintampo. Courts of Justice were established at each of these stations, with appeal to the Court of the Chief Commissioner.
