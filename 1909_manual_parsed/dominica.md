DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 291 square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £12,092. 11s. 1d. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising also Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, the Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor. Trade failed, and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican chief, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying
the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prevost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Rupert's.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Serious riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H. L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of £15,000 by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the Island. The Imperial Road, constructed out of this grant, has now been completed for a distance of 16 miles from Roseau to Bassinville, and a length of 5 miles of a proposed road connecting Bassinville with Layou has also been constructed.

It is estimated that about 130,000 acres in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar has still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is rich and the climate healthy, and the island is well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, especially Arabian, and on the higher slopes in the centre of the island, where a commencement in this direction has recently been made, cocoa, tea, limes, nutmegs, spices, and tropical fruits of all kinds.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufriere Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, ash and scoria covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers stocked with fish, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Cocoa, lime-juice, citrate of lime, and fruit are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, is now only exported in small quantities. A considerable trade is carried on also in spice, oils, and timber. The principal exports in 1907, were: Cocoa, 11,628 cwt.; limes and lime juice, value 65,513l.; citrate of lime, 7,761l.; essential oils, 4,316l.; fruit and vegetables, 2,364l.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1907 was 69:30 inches; the average for the whole island was 108:51 inches; the mean temperature 79:41 Fahr.

The chief town is Roseau, population of about 6,000 on 31st December, 1907; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1907, 16 vessels, of a total tonnage of 147 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of the Colonial Bank at Roseau.

There is a Government telephone system of 300 miles, with 6 exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 6 members. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abrogating itself, and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new council consists of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Administrator presides in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the acquisition and use of English is becoming more general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the Island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1228, 1902).
