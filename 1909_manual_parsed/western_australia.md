WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 50' E.

Coast Line.

The Southern and Western coast line is, to a great extent, of a flat and sandy character, with comparatively few natural harbours or other indentations, until the Kimberley Division is reached, where its character changes, and it becomes bold and broken, and fringed with numerous islands. The total length of the coast line, not including minor features, is estimated to be approximately 4,350 miles.

Bays, Gulfs, &c.

The principal inlets, beginning from the north, are: Cambridge Gulf, Napier Broome Bay, Vansittart Bay, Admiralty Gulf, Montague Sound, York Sound, Brunswick Bay, Camden Sound, Collier Bay, King Sound, Beagle Bay, Roe buck Bay, Lagrange Bay, Port Walcott, Nickol Bay, Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, Champion Bay, Cockburn Sound, Koombana Bay, Geographe Bay, Flinders Bay, King George Sound, Bremer Bay, and Esperance Bay. With the exception of Princess Royal Harbour (the inner harbour of King George Sound), the principal anchorages used to the south of the 19th parallel of latitude are open roadsteads, which, as a rule, are only partially protected; but the holding grounds of these are fairly good, and accidents seldom happen to vessels properly found. Fine harbours have, however, been artificially provided at Fremantle, at the mouth of the Swan River, and at Bunbury, in Koombana Bay.

Capes.

The principal capes are: Capes Domett and Du sejour at the entrance of Cambridge Gulf; Cape Londonderry, which is the most northerly point of the State; Cape Talbot, Cape Bougainville, lying between Admiralty Gulf and Vansittart Bay; Cape Voltaire, which is the western boundary of Admiralty Gulf; Cape Torrens, at the entrance to York Sound; Cape Lévéque, the southern boundary of King Sound; Sloping Head, to the west of Nickol Bay, well known to the North-West pearlers; North-West Cape, which forms the western boundary of Exmouth Gulf; Cape Peron, in Shark Bay; Steep Point, situated on the southern entrance to Shark Bay, which is the most westerly point of the Continent; Capes Naturaliste and Leeuwin at the south-western extremity of the Continent, and Point D'Entrecasteaux, West Cape Howe, Peak Head, Hood Point, Cape le Grande, and Cape Arid on the Southern coast.

Tides.

As would naturally be expected with so extensive a coast line, the tides are very varied, little or no rise and fall being experienced on the South and South-Western coasts, whilst from Shark Bay northwards they increase rapidly, though not uniformly in range, attaining at King Sound a height of 46 feet.

Islands.

The islands which occur on the coast are, as a rule, small and unimportant, those best known being Garden and Rottnest Islands off Fremantle; the Houtman Abrolhos, near Champion Bay, on which guano is found; Dirk Hartogs and other islands in Shark Bay, used for pastoral purposes; Dampier's Archipelago and the Lacepedes, on the North-West coast, the latter of which also contain guano deposits; and, in addition to these, there are the numerous but as yet unexplored islands off the Kimberley or extreme northern coast.

Rivers.

The principal rivers are: in the North, the Ord, with its tributaries, the Denham, Bow, Negri, and Panton; the Pentecost, with its tributary, the Chamberlain; the Durack, Drysdale, King Edward, Prince Regent, Charnley, Iadell, and the Fitzroy, with its tributaries the Margaret River and Christmas Creek. In the North-West the De Grey, with its tributaries, the Oakover, Shaw, and Strelley; the Yule, the Fortescue, and the Ashburton, with its tributaries, the Henry and Hardy. Then, falling to the Western Coast, the Gascoyne, with its tributary, the Lyons; the Murchison, with its tributary, the Sanford; the Greenough; the Swan, on which is situated the capital of the State, and which, above tidal waters, is called the Avon; the Murray, the Collie, and the Preston. And lastly, on the Southern Coast, the Blackwood, Warren, Kalgan, and Phillips Rivers.

Mountains.

In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the King Leopold and the Princess May ranges, the highest point in the latter probably attaining above 3,000 feet. In the North-West, between the Fortescue and Ashburton Rivers, the highest range is the Hamersley, with Mount Bruce (3,800 feet). The Darling range, which extends from Yatheroo in the North to Point D'Entrecasteaux in the South, a distance of about 300 miles, attains its highest elevation, 1,700 feet above the level of the sea, at Mount William in the Murray District. In the South, the loftiest range is the Stirling range, the highest point of which is over 3,000 feet.

Lakes.

There are no lakes of any considerable importance in the State. Between the Darling range and the coast there are a few salt water lagoons, and many fresh water lakes, the majority of which are nothing more than swamps during the dry season, and none of them are of any economic importance. The so-called lakes in the interior of the State, which are frequently of very considerable area, are, except after the occasional heavy rains, merely immense salt marshes or clay-pans.

Contour of the Country.

That part of the State lying to the north of the 19th parallel of latitude may be described as mountainous, consisting of alternating high and lower lying plateaux; the highest country here is principally of sandstone formation. The North-West Division and much of the Gascoyne Division is a distinctly mountainous country, the ranges here being principally granite. The north and north-eastern parts of the State contain a large
area of good pastoral country. A large proportion of the South-Western and Southern sea-boards is of flat, sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation, and may be described as a vast forest, principally timbered with jarrah, white and red gums, and karri, most of which timbers are of great commercial value. From some points on the Western sea-board settlement has now extended for about 500 miles inland; but, from very complete information furnished by explorers and prospectors, it is apparent that no considerable portion of the interior lying between the 19th and 31st parallels of latitude, and between the 121st and 129th meridians of longitude is suitable for any class of settlement except in connection with the development of the mineral resources. This area may be described as a great tableland, with an altitude of from one to two thousand feet above sea level, the surface of which consists largely of sand dunes, though in many parts of it there are large areas of clayey soils. Between the 30th parallel of latitude and the Great Australian Bight, much of the country is of limestone formation, and here there are immense areas of grass land, which only await the discovery of subterranean water to make them amongst the most productive areas of the State.

History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George Sound to form a settlement. In 1827 Captain James (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, in H.M.S. Success, surveyed the coast from King George Sound to the Swan River, and in May, 1829, Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. Challenger, took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain Stirling founded the Swan River Settlement, now the Commonwealth State of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success, until, in 1830, the State was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants' petition that it might be made a penal settlement was acceded to. Up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until, on the 30th June, 1886, only forty Imperial prisoners remained. The Imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

In 1870 the constitution, which was what is called "Representative," was established by Act 33 Vict., No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council, consisting then of three official members of the Executive Council, three unofficial nominees of the Governor, and 12 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 24th December, 1890.

The Legislature consists of two Houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 30 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 50 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.

Provinces.—The State is divided into 10 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Any man who is (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity: (2) a resident in the State for at least 2 years: (3) a natural-born subject of His Majesty or naturalised for 5 years, and a resident in the State during that period.

Qualification of Elector.—"The Constitution Act Amendment Act, 1899," has extended the right to vote equally to both sexes. The qualifications of a voter are laid down in the Act.

Legislative Assembly.

Districts.—There are 50 electoral districts for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by one member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 3 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the State for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the King, or shall have been naturalised for 5 years, and shall have resided in the State for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Subject to certain qualifications every person not under twenty-one years of age, who—

(a) is a natural born or naturalised subject of His Majesty; and

(b) has resided in Western Australia for six months continuously; and

(c) has resided in the district for which he claims to be enrolled for a continuous period of one month immediately preceding the date of his claim,

is entitled to be enrolled as an elector, and when enrolled, and so long as he continues to reside in the district for which he is enrolled, to vote at the election of a member of the Legislative Assembly for that district. No person can be a registered voter in more than one electorate.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible Ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Premier and Minister for Lands; the Colonial Treasurer and Minister for Agriculture; the Minister for Mines and Railways; the Attorney-General; the Minister for Works; the Colonial Secretary; and a Minister without portfolio.

Western Australia is represented in the Federal Senate of Australia by six members, and in the House of Representatives by five members.

Local Government.

Under the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1906," municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding 1s. 6d. in the £ per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, dues, &c., under the Municipal Corporations Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. Similar provisions with regard to Road Boards exist under the "Roads Act, 1902." Municipalities have power to borrow money for the construction of roads and other purposes, whilst Road Boards possess more restricted borrowing powers for the construction of...
roads only. Both may levy loan rates not to exceed 1s. 6d. in the £ on all rateable property. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Beverley, Bunbury, Boulder, Broome, Bulong, Broad Arrow, Paddington, Busselton, Carnarvon, Claremont, Collie, Coolgardie, Cossack, Cottesloe, Cue, Day Dawn, Esperance, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Guildford, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Kookynie, Leederville, Leonora, Malcolm, Mt. Morgans, Mt. Magnet, Menzies, Midland Junction, Nannine, Narrogin, Newcastle, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, North Perth, Perth, Queen's Park, Roebourne, South Perth, Subiaco, Southern Cross, Victoria Park, Wagin, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000 consist of a mayor and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and 12 councillors—the mayor being elected annually by the ratepayers, by whom also the councillors are elected for a term of three years.

Local road boards and municipal councils have power under Acts of Parliament to issue licenses to carts, carriages, &c., within their respective districts and municipalities. Under the Water Works Act, 1889 (53 Vict., 13), the Perth City Council was authorised to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £, but this power was, under the Metropolitan Water Works Act (60 Vict., No. 19), transferred to the Metropolitan Water Works Board, and since, under the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Act, 1904, to the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage; also, under The Health Act, 1889, the Local Boards of Health of municipalities and other localities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 6d. in the £; 42,000/- was granted during the financial year 1906-7, and 57,000/- during the financial year 1907-8, to District Road Boards (of which there were, on the 31st July, 1908, 101 and Municipal Councils (47) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the State, in addition to the moneys expended by the Public Works Department for the same purpose.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the State at the 30th June, 1908, was estimated to be 269,125, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese at the 1901 census was 1,521, of whom 1,503 were males and only 18 females. In addition to these there were 23 male and 25 female half-caste Chinese.

The chief towns are Perth (50,527, including suburbs), Fremantle (18,945, including suburbs) and the following municipalities:—Coolgardie, (2,829), Kalgoorlie (6,954), Albany (2,994), Bunbury (3,410), Claremont (3,699), Geraldton (2,593), Guildford (1,555), Kanowna (1,024), Menzies (1,392), Northam (2,813), York (1,619), Midland Junction (4,062), Boulder (10,357), Collie (1,713), Kookynie (1,520).

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the State, 13,306,495 acres only were, on the 31st December, 1907, alienated or in process of alienation, while 161,992,952 acres were leased, viz., 160,716,918 for pastoral, and the balance for other purposes. No less than 449,289,353 acres were still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 4,350 miles, not including minor features, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. In the south-west corner of the State are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of Northam, York, Newcastle, Beverley, Katanning, Wagin, and the other centres of the southern part of the State, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total area of land under cultivation on 28th Feb., 1908, was 3,481,118 acres, viz., under crop 494,987 acres, under permanent artificially sown grasses 7,990 acres, new ground cleared during the season and prepared for next season's crops 139,430 acres, land in fallow 152,175 acres, area of other cleared land, previously cropped, now used for grazing or lying idle 287,535 acres, ring-barked or partially cleared land 2,399,001 acres; and, beyond this, the traveler's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialised in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian States, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 3,694,852) are depastured in all parts of the State. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1907, principally to London, was 19,914,451 lbs. greasy, valued at 791,485/-, and 295,782 lbs. scoured and washed, valued at 20,603/-. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1907 was valued at 511,923/-. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore, China, and other places to the value of 65,999/- during 1907.

At Shark Bay and on the north-west coast a fleet of 383 schooners, cutters, and luggers are employed on the pearling banks, giving occupation to 179 white, 95 aboriginal, and 2,129 Asiatic pearlers. The export of pearls and shell amounted to 269,815/- in 1907.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but of late years little work has been done in them. Copper, however, has since been found also in several other districts, notably those of Mt. Morgans, Phillips River, and West Pilbara. The exports of copper (ingot and ore) during 1907 were valued at 203,376/-.
The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners to Western Australia, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

Since the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining has become the principal industry of the State, and so rapidly has the annual output of gold increased of late years, that it has now placed Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing States of Australasia.

There are now 19 goldfields in existence—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Gascoyne, Murchison, East Murchison, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, Phillips River, and Donnybrook, and a large population is continually employed in searching for and extracting precious metals.

Much machinery is in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a steady annual output and a settled population. The value of gold produced up to the end of September, 1908, was 83,251,931L In the first nine months of 1908 the value of the gold production was 5,247,526L, against 5,297,582L in the corresponding period of 1907.

There is also good coal in the south-west corner of the State, and evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district. On the Collie Coalfield, situated in the Wellington district, five companies are now successfully working coal-leases. The output in 1907 was 142,373 tons.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered at Greenbushes, on the Blackwood river, resulting in the opening up of a rich tinfield. Considerable quantities of tin have also been recently raised at Marble Bar. The total exports of tin (ingot and ore) during 1907 amounted to 166,139L

Silver is found, mostly together with other minerals, and extracted in conjunction with gold. The amount exported during 1907 was valued at 25,382L. Other minerals found are antimony, tantalite, lead, asbestos, cobalt, mica, plumbago, ironstone and limestone.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the State: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank of Australia, and the Bank of Australasia.

The deposits in the banks during the year ended 31st December, 1907, averaged 5,348,208L.

A Government Post Office savings bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1907, amounted to 1,962,554L, and during the year ended 30th June, 1908, to 2,022,038L.

A branch of the Royal Mint exists in Perth. The quantity of raw gold received at the Perth Mint during 1901 was 860,281 ozs., during 1902, 1,354,615 ozs., during 1903, 1,452,624 ozs., and during 1904, 1,403,084 ozs. During 1905 a total of 1,500,227 ozs. of fine gold was received at the Mint, during 1906, of 1,232,296 ozs., and during 1907, of 1,265,753 ozs.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the State, and are under the supervision of the Minister controlling the Education Department, assisted by committees of management.

Attendance at school of all children between the ages of six and fourteen is compulsory, and only in special circumstances is exemption granted to children between the ages of 12 and 14. General religious teaching, exclusive of dogmatic or polemic theology, is included in the course of instruction given, whilst half an hour each day is reserved for special religious denominational instruction if desired.

Cadet corps have been organised in connection with several State schools.

Western Australia does not at present possess a University, but aspirants for the B.Sc degree of the Adelaide University may go through their full course at the Perth Technical School. Local examinations for B.A. and LL.B. degrees of the Adelaide and the London Universities may also be arranged for, as well as for the B.Sc. and B.Sc. (Economics) of the latter institution. The Adelaide University Junior, Senior, and Higher Public Examinations are held at regular intervals, whilst the London and Melbourne Universities hold them whenever occasion arises. Steps have been taken to reserve land for the purpose of endowment of a local University.

The Perth Technical School, which has now been established some years, is in a very flourishing condition, and the scope of its curriculum is correspondingly increasing. Branches of this school are in operation at various centres of the State, whilst in some places Manual Training Evening Classes are held. Besides the Boys' High School, which is subsidised by the State, there are the Christian Brothers' College, the Scotch College, and the Guildford Grammar School, which provide for boys the necessary basis for a university education, whilst for the girls similar institutions exist in the Perth Girls' High School, the Notre Dame Convent, the Claremont Girls' High School, and the Methodist Ladies College, Claremont. A Mining School exists at Kalgoorlie. Several bursaries of the value of 10L each are offered by the Government for competition annually amongst boys and girls attending Government and efficient private primary schools. Three or more secondary school scholarships, of the value of 50L per annum, tenable for four years, in an approved secondary school, are also offered. In addition to these, five Senior Exhibitions of 25L and eight Junior of 15L each are competed for on the results of the Adelaide University Higher Public, Senior, and Junior Examinations, whilst two University Exhibitions of 150L a year, tenable for three years in any recognised University of the British Empire, are also offered by the Government for competition. One Rhodes Scholarship, of the value of 300L a year, for a three years' course at Oxford, is annually awarded.

In order that the State may be assured that all children attending private schools are receiving efficient instruction, these schools are regularly inspected, to ascertain whether the instruction...
given in reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, and geography, is satisfactory.

The amount disbursed for education during the financial year ended June 30th, 1908, was £76,022.

At the end of the year 1907 there were 381 Government schools in the State, with 29,074 scholars on the rolls. The number of private schools at the same date was 112, with 7,639 scholars.

Means of Communication.

The State possesses at present five lines of Government railways:

| Division | Main Line | Miles |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| 1. Eastern Railway—Fremantle to Perth and Northam, including Owen's Anchorage, Jandakot and Woodman's Point, Belmont, Upper Darling Range, Newcastle, Greenhills, Quairading and Beverley branches, and Mahogany Creek Deviation | ... | 206 |
| 2. Eastern Goldfields Railway—From Northam Eastwards to Southern Cross, Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, including Kanowna, Leonora, Laverton, Lakeside, Goomalling, and Dowerin, Widgemooltha, and Boulder branches, and Brown Hill loop line... | ... | 657 |

| 4. Great Southern Railway—Reverley to Albany, including Darkan, Dumbleyung, Kojonup and Denmark branches... | ... | 329 |
| 5. Northern Railway—Geraldton to Nannine, and including Walkaway and Northampton branches... | ... | 355 |

Total... | ... | 1,943

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Midland Junction and Walkaway, and connects the two Government systems of railways.

There are also several other private lines, mostly constructed by timber companies in the south of the State, in extent about 430 miles.

A scheme has for years been under consideration by the Commonwealth Government for the connection, by a proposed Transcontinental Railway (ft. 8½in. gauge) from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, of the Railway systems of Western and South Australia, a distance of about 1,100 miles.

The receipts of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1908, were £1,501,925l., and the working expense £1,007,732l. The total cost of construction has been £10,732,941l.

Of electric telegraph at the end of 1907 there were 10,196 miles of wire. The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1907 was 1,736,985, and the revenue received by the telegraph branch was £73,197l.; telephone receipts amounted to £24,306l., and postal and other revenue of the post and telegraph department to £156,023l.; cost of post and telegraph, £319,141l. There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay, also with South Africa by Cocos Island. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the State, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 9,842 miles of telephone wire in the State; further 8,262 miles of Government, and 489 miles of private railway telephone wire.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient, Messageries Maritimes, and Nord-Deutscher Lloyd Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the other Australasian States, whilst the White Star line conveys those from and to South Africa at regular monthly intervals. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australasian States by the various inter-State steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 28 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

Letters, Newspapers per ½-oz.

Within a Town, and between any two places on the Suburban Railway Line from Fremantle to Midland Junction... 1d. ½d. per 10 ozs.
Within the State... 2d. ½d. per 10 ozs.
Australasia... 2d. ½d. per 10 ozs.
United Kingdom and Dependencies... 2d. 1d. per 4 ozs.
Other Countries of Postal Union... 2½d. 1d. per 4 ozs.

The postal statistics for 1907 give the following as the number (each counted once) of letters and postcards, &c., received and despatched:

| English, Inland, Inter-State, and Foreign |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Letters... 15,950,790                    |
| Newspapers... 4,702,047                  |
| Packets and parcels... 2,850,008         |
| Postcards... 1,230,641                   |

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 335 vessels and a tonnage of 18,545 on 31st December, 1907. Harbour works have been constructed, and the Royal Mail steamers, as also those of the Nord-Deutscher Lloyd and the Messageries Maritimes, make Fremantle their port of call.

Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. The natives were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are occasionally employed as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule, they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate
liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned the successful mission conducted at New Norcia (founded by the late Right Reverend Bishop Salvado), which was commenced in the year 1846. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia was passed by the Houses of Legislature in 1897, but has since been repealed by the "Aborigines Act" of 1903. In accordance with the clauses of the latter the welfare of the natives is now entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a Minister of the Crown, and provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of £10,000 to be used by this sub-department. In addition to this sum, a further amount of £4,259 was spent on behalf of the Aborigines during the year ending 30th June, 1908.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate during 1907 was 11.09 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33.18 inches (for 32 years), and the mean temperature is 64°. The rainy season extends from May to October.
