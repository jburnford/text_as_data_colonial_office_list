TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouille, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

By Order in Council under Act 50 & 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, Tobago became a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from the 1st January, 1899.

Situation and Area.

It is in N. lat. 11° 9', W. long. 60° 12', distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26° N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-western direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,313 acres, of which about 10,000 acres are under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

General Description.

Sugar, rum, molasses, coconuts, and live stock form the principal articles of export. Cocos and rubber are now, however, being fairly extensively planted. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the Windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1789 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The cultivation of cotton is now forming an important minor industry in Tobago, and a cotton gin, operated by a steam engine, has been erected by the Government in the chief town Scarborough.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 42 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1901, of 769. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacolet Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of subsidized coastal steamers, provided under contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was
provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created. Various other changes have been made in the direction of reducing the establishments.

**Turks and Caicos Islands**

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is 169 square miles, about the size of Rutland. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 61 miles long and 2 miles broad. According to the census of 1901 Grand Turk contains 1,751 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

Grand Turk claims, like many other islands, to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermudas. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered being about 1,800,000 bushels, equal to 60,000 tons. The export of salt in 1907 was valued at 16,557l. Sponges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There are three sponge-curing establishments on the Caicos Islands. The export of sponge in 1907 was valued at 3,045l. The cultivation of the sisal fibre (or Pitta plant) has been introduced, and has a fair prospect of success. Fibre to the value of 3,107l. was exported in 1907.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. The commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1907, 42 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,277 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the strong and never-failing sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 79°, the extreme range being from 61° to 92°. The rainfall during 1907 amounted to 28 inches, the rainy season...
being from October to February. Hurricanes occasionally visit the groups. There was a severe hurricane in the autumn of 1908, causing great destruction of property.

Means of Communication.

A steamer of Messrs. Pickford and Black, running under Government contract, leaves Halifax for Jamaica every month, calling at Grand Turk both going and returning. The length of voyage between England and Turks Islands is about fourteen days via New York, and eighteen days via Halifax or Jamaica.

The steamers of the Imperial Direct West India Mail Service from Bristol to Jamaica call off Grand Turk every two weeks to land mails and passengers, but do not touch on the homeward voyage. Length of voyage 11 days.

The Clyde Line from New York to St. Domingo call at Grand Turk every two weeks, the length of passage being five days.

There are no railways or telegraph lines in the Colony.

The estimated number of letters to the United Kingdom is 3,100, and to all other countries 13,200 per annum.

The rate of letter postage is 1d. per ounce to all countries included in the penny post arrangement; outside that, 2½d. per ounce. There is no internal post.

Cable communication with Bermuda and Jamaica was established by the Direct West India Cable Company in January, 1898, the station being fixed at Grand Turk. The rates are per word: To England 3s., to Jamaica 1s., to Halifax 2s.

Education.

There are seven elementary schools supported by Government, with an average attendance in 1907 of 547 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, Mexican, and Columbian gold doubloons, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1907, 238 depositors, with 2,246l. deposit.

Constitution.

The Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.
