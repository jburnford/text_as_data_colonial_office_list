THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Leeward Islands, so called in contrast to the Windward Islands, which are most exposed to the N.E. Trade, the prevailing wind in the West Indies, form the most northerly group of the Lesser Antilles, the whole of which were included among the Windward Islands as the term was used by the Spaniards. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin) and the United States (Bieques and Culebra). The English Leeward Islands comprising the Presidencies of Antigua (with its dependencies, Barbuda and Redonda), Montserrat, St. Kitts, and Nevis (including Anguilla), Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the Colony is 704 square miles, about the size of the county of Surrey, and its population about 129,240.

The island of Sombrero was added to the colony by Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act, on August 10th, 1904.

History.

The islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica, they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are affected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1883, by the Act 3 & 4 Will. IV., c. 74. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Colonies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about
46 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December.

**Constitution.**

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 1 of 1899, the Legislative Council now consists of eight official and eight elective members. Three elective members are chosen by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, and three by those of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The official members are the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, the Administrators of St. Kitts, Nevis, and Dominica, and the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation, and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts for about one week.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the Legislative Body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act.

**Currency and Banking.**

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. The Colonial Bank has a branch in Antigua, one in St. Kitts, and one in Dominica. In the Virgin Islands, Montserrat and Nevis, there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (3,500£), and St. Kitts (14,000£), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

**Means of Communication.**

Mail communication exists with England and also with the other West Indian Islands (including Jamaica) and Demerara, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the southern islands, and to the United States of America, about once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line, and to Demerara, the other West Indian Islands (except Jamaica), Bermuda, and the Dominion of Canada by steamers of the Pickford and Black Line every 12th day. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scruton's Direct Line and others. The usual time occupied by the voyage from England to Antigua is about 14 days.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia (via Martinique) and Guadeloupe, and two cables connect St. Kitts with Antigua and St. Thomas. Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States, Bermuda, Canada and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable stations to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

**Postage.**

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union, but in the case of the U.K., India and certain Colonies,* letter postage is 1d. per oz. Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Dominica, the rates being 1d. for the first oz., and ½d. for every additional oz. within each of the islands.

Chief Towns.

The most important towns are St. John (Antigua), 9,047; Basseterre (St. Kitts), 9,962; and Roseau (Dominica), 5,764.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational, except in Dominica, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics. With four exceptions, all the schools in Dominica are supported wholly from public funds. There are also two Government Schools in Antigua. The schools established by the denominations receive grants-in-aid, amounting, in 1907-8, to 6,951l. The cost of the Government Schools in Antigua and Dominica was, for the same period, slightly over 2,000l. School fees are charged only in Antigua and the Virgin Islands, and the schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. There are about 124 aided and Government Schools, attended by 26,314 children. Grants of varying amount are also made to grammar schools established in all the islands, except Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. Provision is also made for agricultural and technical instruction. The amount of Government Grant to secondary schools in the Colony exceeds 1,000l. for about 300 scholars.
