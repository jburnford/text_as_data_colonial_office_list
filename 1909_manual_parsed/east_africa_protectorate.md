EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The East Africa Protectorate extends from the Umba to the Juba River, and inland as far as the borders of Uganda. It includes certain mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the German frontier to Kipini, the islands of the Lamu Archipelago, and an area of 10 miles round the fort of Kisimayu, these territories having been leased to Great Britain for an annual rent of 17,000£. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers have been defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891).

All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction has, during the present year, been transferred to the British Court. The Protectorate consists of seven provinces and a tract of territory not yet organised lying to the north-west. The provinces are each under a Provincial Commissioner, and are divided into districts and sub-districts as follows: Seyidie (capital, Mombasa), comprising the districts of Vanga, Mombasa, Malindi and Mwatate, and the sub-districts of Rabai and Taveta; Ukamba (capital, Nairobi), including the districts of Kitui, Kikuyu, South Masailand and Ulu; Tanaland (capital, Lamu), with districts of Lamu and Kipini; Jubaland (capital, Kisimayu), consisting of the districts of Upper and Lower Jubaland; Kenya (capital, Fort Hall), with districts of Fort Hall, Nyeri and Embu; the Naivasha Province (capital, Naivasha), including the districts of Naivasha, Eldama Ravine, North Masailand and Baringo; the Kisumu Province (capital, Kisumu or Port Florence), including the districts of Kisumu, Elgon, Nandi, Kericho and Karungu, and the sub-district of Lumbwa. The two provinces last named were formerly the Eastern Province of Uganda, but were transferred to the East African Protectorate on April 1st, 1902.

The Protectorate has an area of about 200,000 square miles. Mombasa is the largest town; the inhabitants number about 30,000, of whom 200 are Europeans. It is situated on an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, the latter having a pier connected with the Uganda Railway. The second largest, and perhaps the most important, town in the Protectorate is Nairobi, the capital of the Ukamba Province, headquarters of the Administration and the central station on the Uganda Railway. The inhabitants number 13,514, of whom 579 are Europeans, and 3,071 Indians. There are also 400 European farmers and some 50,000 natives in the immediate vicinity of Nairobi. Port Florence is the railway station on Lake Victoria.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 4,000,000, including 25,000 Asiatics and 2,000 Europeans and Eurasians. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Masai, the Somalis and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, German, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Legislation is by Ordinances made by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council, the Indian codes being followed as far as applicable. The High Court is situated at Mombasa, and sessions are held at Nairobi, Naivasha and Kisumu. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the East Africa Protectorate.

Climate.

The Lowlands, or districts near the coast, are fairly healthy for the tropics. The hot season is from January to April. The Highlands, or central plateaux, have a temperate climate, the mean average temperature at noon is 78° F. July, August and September are usually cold months.

Products and Trade.

The agricultural products of the lowlands are coconuts, rice, maize, and various native grains; cotton and tobacco are also being cultivated. Experiments with a view to a large extension of cotton growing are being made, and the introduction of other seeds and plants of economic value is being tried. In the highlands potatoes grow freely, and are now exported; coffee, wheat and barley are successfully cultivated,
but not yet on a large scale. On the uplands enormous pasture grounds are available for cattle.

The forest products of the coast are rubber, gum-copal and timber. Mangroves grow on the coast, acacia and ebony in the scrub forests further inland. The highland forests yield rubber, fibres and castor-oil beans, and contain croton, olive, fig and several good timber trees. The greater part of the forest area is quite unexplored, though a large syndicate has now obtained a concession for cutting timber, and is surveying the forest north of the railway. Several large areas of fibre-bearing land have been leased near Voi and Kibwezi for the purpose of developing the Sansevieria fibre, which is indigenous.

The mineral resources of the Protectorate are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; mica and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba; gold mining began, but was discontinued. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

* This is an apparent, not an actual falling off. Included in 1906 is one grant of 320,000 acres to the East African Syndicate.

The value of the imports (exclusive of railway material, administration stores, and specie) and of the exports, the amount of the customs receipts at the eight ports, and the tonnage entered at Mombasa and Kilindini were (rupee 16d.), as follows:

Foreign imports by sea are liable to duty at the rate of 10 per cent. ad valorem, but certain articles imported for agricultural, stock-breeding, railway and some other purposes are free. There are specific export duties.

In 1907-8 the chief imports were cotton goods, 197,044l.; rice, grain, flour, 89,176l.; iron and steel wares, 33,807l.; wines and spirits, 31,800l.; provisions, 65,453l.; tobacco, 18,814l.

Communications.

Mombasa is visited by the steamers of four lines. The vessels of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and those of the Messageries Maritimes, call monthly; those of the German East Africa line every three weeks, and those of a branch of this line from Bombay call fortnightly. A new line, called the Dale Line, commenced in May, 1906, a monthly service. Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by a steamer belonging to the Administration.

The Uganda (Mombasa-Victoria) Railway is worked as a State Railway of the East Africa Protectorate. Its length is 584 miles, with a gauge of one metre. The construction cost to March 31st, 1908, was 5,456,760l. (approximate). The telegraph is worked by the East Africa Protectorate Postal Department at the principal stations, and at smaller stations by the railway staff. Two steamers on the Lake are also worked in connection with the railway. In 1907-8 (exclusive of railway material) 54,855 tons of goods, and 255,700 passengers were carried.

Revenue . . . . . . . . . . £232,070
Expenditure . . . . . . . . . 187,356

The Post Office of the Protectorate (exclusive of the Uganda Post Office, which is worked by the Protectorate Post Office), received and despatched 2,028,576 letters, packets, etc., in the year 1907-8.

The telegraph system, excluding the lines in Uganda, has 2,263 miles of line, the railway telegraph line having three wires. The lines connect Mombasa and Lamu (200 miles), Mombasa and Kisumu (684 miles), Kisumu and Entebbe (225 miles), Entebbe and Butiaba (205 miles), Hoima and Wadelai (115 miles), Londiani and Eldama Ravine (18 miles), Lumbwa and Kericho (19 miles), Nairobi and Fort Hall (55½ miles), and Kibigori and Nandi (12 miles). The Eastern Telegraph Company has a cable connecting Mombasa with Zanzibar.
