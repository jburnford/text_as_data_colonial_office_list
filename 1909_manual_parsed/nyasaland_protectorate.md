NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.

(See Map under Rhodesia, South Africa).

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shiré Highlands and Mlanje.

It is bounded on the north by German East Africa, on the west by the British South Africa Company’s Territory known as “North Eastern Rhodesia,” on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and has a total area of about 43,608 square miles, according to the most recent survey.

It is divided into thirteen districts, each in charge of a resident, who is also a district magistrate. An agent of the Government is stationed at Chinde at the mouth of the Zambesi, where a concession has been leased from the Portuguese Government as a landing and forwarding depot for goods intended for British Territory north of the Zambesi, and where a Postal Agency is also established.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 200 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

History.

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (now Sir H. H. Johnston, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaos round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shiré districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the “Jumbe” or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wainenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (now Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasaland was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shiré and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaos at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled.

The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. On the 22nd February, 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to “The British Central Africa Protectorate,” but the old name “Nyasaland Protectorate” was revived in October, 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.
NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.

Constitution.

The administration of the Protectorate, which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Zanzibar.

Climate and Products.

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shire Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shire Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shire Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

Industry.

The chief products of the Protectorate are cotton, coffee, tobacco, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat; rice and wheat, however, are not exported.

The chief imports are, provisions, cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition.

Population (31st March, 1907).

Europeans, 587; Asiatics (not including Sikh Troops), 515; Natives, 948,270.

Means of Communication.

A railway from Port Herald to Chiromo (the inland "port" of the Protectorate), and thence to Blantyre, with proposed extension to Zomba and Lake Nyasa, is in course of construction. The first 113 miles to Blantyre are open for traffic. There are nineteen steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shire between Chinde and the highest navigable point of the Shire, whence the journey to the Shire Highlands is continued by road. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being 2,938 miles. There are six steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Steamers arrive and depart every three weeks at Chinde (the port of entry at the mouth of the Zambesi) to Europe, via the Suez Canal, or by Durban and Cape Town. Mails to and from England, are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

A message from Zomba to London takes about twenty-four hours in transmission. The total mileage through the Protectorate is 808 miles.

Currency and Banking.

By a Proclamation in the Official Gazette of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling.
