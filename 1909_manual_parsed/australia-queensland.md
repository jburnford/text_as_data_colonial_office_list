AUSTRALIA—QUEENSLAND.

(174 miles) having been carried through Charters Towers, the latter town, a great gold-mining centre, having a population of 20,976 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the sites of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook District a railway is constructed intended ultimately to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 68 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also constructed from Cairns, 69 miles on the sea coast, to Mareeba, with a branch to Atherton, connecting with the private line to Chilagoe and Mungana, 103 miles, with a branch to Mount Garnet, tapping a large area rich in minerals. There is also a line from Cairns to Harvey's Creek, 31 miles. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, 96 miles, south-easterly.

There is also a steam tramway line from Townsville to Ayr, a distance of 44 miles. There are 556 electric telegraph stations in the State. The number of miles of line 10,233, with 21,000 miles of wire. The receipts of the Post and Telegraph Department were 448,396l.

The number of messages during 1907 was 2,119,674. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 4,820 subscribers who use it, and 31 Telephone Exchanges and cables containing multiple wires have been laid underground to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street, and to secure a metallic circuit, and the Revenue amounted to 42,877l.

Communication with London is maintained, via Suez every week; via San Francisco and Sydney every three weeks; via Vancouver every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi is thirty-four days. There is daily communication with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia. The rates of postage are:

A Parcel Post with England is in operation.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict. No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1907 there were in operation 1,083 schools with an enrolment of 105,382 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 163 private schools, with 14,341 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 1,944 pupils on the roll. A University is about to be established. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

Immigration.

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 61,927, and the departures to all countries 57,504, showing an excess of arrivals of 4,423. The arrivals of Chinese numbered 482, and of Pacific Islanders 350, whilst the departures of these coloured aliens numbered 784 and 3,278, and their deaths 82 and 63 respectively.

By Act 53 Vict., No. 2, the number of Chinese to be landed by any one ship is limited to the proportion of one to every five hundred tons of the tonnage of such ship.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The Elections Act Amendment Act of 1905 provides for male and female adult franchise on residential qualification only, a twelve months' continuous residence in the State being the only proviso, subject to disqualifications for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc. Owners of freeholds and leaseholds of a certain value possessing a residential qualification in another electorate can elect to be registered for the former in lieu of that within which they reside, but no persons can be enrolled for more than one electorate.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 44 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act, No. 10 of 1887, as amended by the Electoral Districts Act of 1892, the State is divided into 61 districts, of which 11 return two members, and 50 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.
