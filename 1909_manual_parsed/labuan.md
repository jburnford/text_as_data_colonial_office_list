LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30-23 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

The island, then uninhabited, was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the Island. Hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success, but, in 1833, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited, by whom the mines are at present being developed.

The coal from the Brooketon mine of the Rajah of Sarawak is exported from Labuan, and, in 1906, 11,881 tons were brought over for sale.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty, and vessels drawing 15 feet alongside the old jetties to coal.

A stone pier, with a wooden T-head to allow of coal wagons being directly discharged into vessels drawing 27 feet, has been constructed by the coal company.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton from standcocks close to the piers, and H.M. ships with coal, by agreement, at 15s. per ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, tortoise-shell, and beche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation. There are sago factories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is no bank or savings bank. The currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary coins, Straits notes also circulate in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Brunei, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

Two schools are aided by Government grants, but there are no Government schools, and education is not compulsory.
The Government was until the end of 1906 administered by a Governor, who, under Letters Patent of 6th November, 1889, alone made ordinances, there being no legislative council. Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant-in-aid, but since then the Colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony, which in turn was replaced by armed constabulary from British North Borneo. At the end of 1889 it was arranged that the Governor of the territory of the British North Borneo Company should be appointed Governor of Labuan. This arrangement came to an end in 1905, and from 1st January, 1906, the present Governor of the Straits was commissioned as Governor of Labuan. By Letters Patent issued towards the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of Labuan in the Colony of the Straits Settlements, and the incorporation took effect from the 1st January, 1907.

A railway has been made, 2 feet 5 inch gauge, and of about 10 miles in length, from Victoria Harbour to the coal mines at Coal Point. The railway is the property of the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited.

The Labuan Water Company was started in 1885, and, with two miles of piping, supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with potable water.

The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has connected Singapore, Borneo and Hong Kong by cable via Labuan. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

Steamers go about twice a month to Singapore, and also to North Borneo and Sulu. Most of the vessels calling at Labuan are engaged in the North Borneo trade, and ply regularly between the ports of that State, Singapore, and Manila, making Labuan a port of call, while several vessels call for bunker and cargo coal, on their way to and from northern ports of China, and the Philippines.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are cheaply supplied by a Navy contractor. Labuan has joined the Postal Union and the Imperial Penny Post.*

The chief sources of revenue are the farming of licences to sell tobacco, spirits, opium (retail), and the rent of market stalls.

**BRUNEI.**

Brunei is a state lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. Out of this original state the territories of the North Borneo Company and the Raja of Sarawak have been carved, and it appears to have been at one time powerful, claiming jurisdiction over a large part of Borneo as well as over part of the Philippines. Its area is now only about 4,000 miles, with a population of about 30,000.

The outlying districts are Tutong, Belait and Tamburong, with others of less importance.

An agreement was concluded with the Sultan in 1888, under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan.

A further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000. Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 100 in the capital. The principal imports are cloth and sundries, and the principal exports coal, cutch, rotans, sago and damar. The trade, to which an impetus has been given by the inauguration of a new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

A cutch factory has been established by a London syndicate at Brunei, and coal is worked by the Raja of Sarawak at Muara (Brooketon) at the mouth of the Brunei river, under the terms of a concession granted in 1882.

The Sultan and his leading ministers would derive a considerable income from the yearly cession payments made by the British North Borneo and Sarawak Governments had they not mortgaged them for years to come. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amounts recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from an opium and spirit farm and from the collection of customs duties.

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years prior to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889 by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1885 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Resident-General and to the High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In addition to the above States, the State and Territory of Johore, with which a treaty had been made as early as the year 1855, and other treaties subsequently, entered into closer relations with the Colony in 1885, when the Sultan, by Agreement of 11th December, 1885 (C.4627), placed his foreign relations in the hands of the British Government, and agreed to receive a British Agent, who, however, has not yet been appointed.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States other than Johore, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements stand, the States agree to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States, to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertake to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, all moneys so advanced being considered as loans, and also undertake to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States; and should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power, they engage to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States named meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

**Péra k.**

H.H. Sir Idris Mersid-el-Aüzam Sham, G.C.M.G., Sultan.

Péra k is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula.

* A not inconsiderable portion of Pahang trade is included in the Selangor returns only, at Port Swettenham.

† Square miles.
and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment to the Seychelles of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State, which has an area of 6,580 square miles, is well watered, the Perak, with its tributaries the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam, with its tributary, the Slim. The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

The chief export is tin. Sugar and rice are extensively grown. The cultivation of rubber is now attracting great attention, and such consignments as have been exported have realised very high prices. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 70,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta and Batang Padang are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is 627 of metalled and 65 of unmetalled cart roads, 712 miles of bridle and other paths.

The whole length of the State is traversed by the main line of railway from Penang.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre, and at Kuala Kangsar, where His Highness the Sultan resides. The chief towns are Ipoh (which has made extraordinary progress), Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, Tapah and Batu Gajah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Selangor.

H.H.Suleiman bin Almerhum Raja Musa, C.M.G.
Sultan.

Selangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Perak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

The total area is estimated at 3,200 square miles, with a coast line extending for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Perak and Selangor, the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Perak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines.

The climate is uniform, and may be described as hot and moist. The nights are cool. The average maximum temperature in the low country is 91 and the average minimum temperature is 71. The rainfall varies considerably, as much as 124 inches having been registered. The wettest seasons are during March and April, and from October to December.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 80,000. It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 5½ miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenice design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and a new post office. There is also a branch of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence. The telegraph system extends all over the State, and the telephone, with the exchange at Kuala Lumpur, is worked over about 400 miles of wire.

There are 53 schools in the State; 46 are maintained by Government for education in native languages, the remainder are grants-in-aid schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and has wharves capable of accommodating ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels registered during 1907 was 542,516.

The total revenue of the State during 1907 amounted to $10,514,654, and the expenditure to $7,026,914.

There is no public debt.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, railways and land. The only import duties are those charged on opium and spirituous liquors. In 1907 the gross total value of imports was $25,703,523, and the exports $29,281,438.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1907 was 273,400 piculs, valued at $23,358,197. The area alienated for mining is 72,852 acres, and there are 73,543 Chinese employed exclusively in this industry. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress for some years, but received a severe check owing to the fall in price. There are 21,321 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides, especially in the coast districts, which appear to be the locality most in favour by rubber prospectors. Most of the large estates have been converted into and sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1907 the area alienated for rubber cultivation was 194,183 acres, of which 60,692 acres were planted up. The value of rubber exported during 1907 was estimated at $2,380,050.

There are 115 miles of metalled town streets, 12 miles of metalled, and 69 miles of gravelled country roads, and 213 miles of bridle paths.
Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Tunyku Mohamed, C.M.G., Yany di Pertuan of Sri Menanti, and Chiefs.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan dates, as at present constituted, from 1895; but a similar Federation was already in existence before that year. The present Federation consists of the following States: Sungei Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungei Uj-ong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, on the coast, Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, Kuala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and Tampin.

The total area of the State is about 2,600 square miles. The population, which stood at 96,028 in 1901 and is now considerably over that figure, is mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Tamils.

The value of imports amounted to $4,209,299 in 1907, and that of exports to $8,807,864. The revenue of the State, which in 1907 amounted to $2,265,605, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1907 30,600 acres of land had been alienated for mining and 226,000 acres for agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative.

The Malay population, numbering some 70,000, is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

Besides rice the chief agricultural products are rubber, gambier and coconuts.

During 1907 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:— Rice 35,000 acres, rubber 18,000 acres, gambier 21,000 acres, and coconuts 8,000 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses nearly 50 Malay vernacular schools, and an English school at Seremban, which receives a grant from Government. Education is much appreciated by the Malays of the Negri Sembilan. A few Tamil vernacular schools also have been opened.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 630 miles, and consists of 377 miles of metalled and 29 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 224 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts. The Federated Malay States railway line passes through the State via Seremban and Tampin. Seremban is also connected by rail with the coast at Port Dickson.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Sir Ahmad Maitham Shah bin Almerhum Ali, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the north by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the south by the territory of Johore, on the west and south-west by Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sembilan, and on the east by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, having an estimated area of some 14,000 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Leper and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for house-boats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. This mineral has also been discovered at Penjum, Kechau, Selensing, and several other places in the State.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 208 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River, and 83 miles by road from Kuala Kubu, on the F.M.S. railway, in the State of Selangor.

The Sultan resides at Pekan, the old capital, near the mouth of the Pahang River.

There is a daily motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 83 miles, and from Raub to Bentong, via Tras and Tranum, a distance of 30 miles. The cars meet at Tranum, giving Bentong, a large mining centre, a daily service to and from Kuala Kubu and Kuala Lipis.

A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Raub, Kuala Lipis, and Bentong.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan (104 miles), and from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungei Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles.

An important road is now under construction, and will, when completed, connect Benta, a point
16 miles from Kuala Lipis with Kuantan on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. The distance is about 160 miles in length, and it will render accessible large areas of land which are believed to be suitable for both mining and agriculture; but it will at present be difficult to persuade miners and planters to come to Pahang so long as they can find land in the other States, where means of communication are easier and transport expenses lighter.

The construction of a line of railway from Gemas in the Negri Sembilan to Kuala Semantan in Central Pahang, a distance of about 70 miles, has been commenced. This is expected to prove of great value in opening up the State.

The total revenue of the State during 1907 amounted to $821,425, and the expenditure to $1,297,242. Pahang has at present to look to Perak and Selangor for financial support.

In the absence of complete records, it is only possible to estimate the population approximately. The census of 1901 gave a total of 84,113, and the figure is now probably over 100,000.

Situation and Area.

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange River Colony and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22° S. degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude.

Its area is 111,196 square miles, with a population, according to the census of 17th April, 1904, of 1,269,951, of whom 297,277 are whites, 937,127 aboriginal natives, and 35,547 other coloured races. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea. The climate is healthy, except in the lower country, to the north and east, which is hot and often feverish. The winter is the dry, and the summer the wet, season. Heavy storms are frequent in summer.

History.

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British Government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1858, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession, and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagoa Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1875, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000l., in Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,000l. were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetewayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuana chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; a guerrilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.

The annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shepstone at the time had with him but a few mounted policemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not arrive in the province for some time after the English Government had been set up, with the apparent acquiescence of the public. But subsequently hostile feelings towards the annexation were widely manifested, and two deputations were sent to England after annexation, to represent those who were opposed to that measure and desired a withdrawal of the British Government. In each case the answer of Her late Majesty's Government was a decided negative.

In December, 1880, a majority of the Boers took up arms against the Government, and hoisted the flag of the South African Republic at Heidelberg. The towns held by Imperial troops were immediately invested, and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, which was being withdrawn from Lydenburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force at headquarters, was surprised, and after suffering very heavy loss, compelled to surrender.

The towns, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy Colley, without waiting for reinforcements, collected the small force at his disposal and advanced from Maritzburg to relieve them. A large force of Boers, determined to oppose his entry into the Transvaal, took possession of Laing's Nek, the path by which he had to cross the Drakensberg range.

On the 28th of January the English troops made a gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but they were driven back with heavy loss. The Boers followed up this advantage by cutting off Sir G. Colley's communications with Newcastle, with a view to prevent his receiving the reinforcements which had been sent out, and were now on the way up. To re-open his communications he crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked by the Boers. The action continued all day; at nightfall the Boers drew off, and the English forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being made by President Brand, of the Orange Free State, to bring about an understanding, and in reply to the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's Government, they declared that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition to the English troops, a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of all difficulties. This message was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February,
in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent unopened to the headquarters of the Boers at Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to General Colley that no definite answer could be given to the message from Her Majesty's Government until Mr. Kruger's views were known. Dr. Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the 26th of February, General Colley, having received no reply to his message, moved out with three hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss, while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped, the rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Sir G. Pomeroy Colley himself was killed by a bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood, who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the advance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of President Brand, an interview took place on the 6th of March between him and General Joubert, who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek, which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice, with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr. Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E. Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's Government should allow the Transvaal self-government as regards its own interior affairs; that the control and management of the foreign relations of the State should be reserved to Her Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident. The functions of this officer, and the provisions for the protection of the interests of the native population, were to be determined by Her Majesty's Government on the recommendation of a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to consider the whole question of the settlement of the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand was invited to be present at the conferences of the Commissioners with the representatives of the Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The sittings of the Commission were opened on the 28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recommendations of the Commission were submitted in detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the result a Convention was framed embodying the terms of the peace agreement, assigning the boundaries of the State, defining the functions of the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-general and charge d'afaires, and conferring upon him extensive powers for the protection of the interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also formed the medium of communication between the Government of the Transvaal and the native States on its borders. Stipulations were made for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-commission, composed of the two judges of the High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident, was appointed to consider claims for compensation for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of August, and on the 8th of that month the Government was handed over to the representatives of the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Convention, and constant trouble occurred on the border, especially on the South-Western border, where the Bechuanaland tribes suffered severely from the incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal, which the Transvaal Government entirely failed to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to account by acquiring fresh territory in violation of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her Majesty's Government yielded to representations of the Transvaal Government and granted a new Convention, which was signed in London on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, became of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs, the Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX., to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen.

"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuanaland, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the
South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention. The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to £177,877, had risen in 1890 to £229,061, reaching £329,958 in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time; other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1895 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifts by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1895, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his intermeditation Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances, and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens' Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1898, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiators. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 10th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic, and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volksraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop; this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state; (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as
express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years' offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years' basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years' franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years' franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

After some correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw in its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 29th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslaagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnaissance from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Cape Town for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R. Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chieveley after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enslin, and on the 28th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.

The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronje was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.
The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brebner, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions.

His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7).
placing subsidised schools under the control of the Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (35, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation being accordingly by Ordinance.

On the 31st March, 1905, Letters Patent were passed providing for the constitution of a Legislative Assembly to consist of the Lieut.-Governor and not less than six or more than nine official members, and (provisionally) not less than thirty or more than thirty-five elected members. But in December, 1906, this Constitution was revoked and a new one substituted.

**Constitution.**

On December 6th, 1906, Letters Patent were issued conferring full responsible government upon the Transvaal. The new legislature consists of two chambers. The Legislative Council contains 15 members, who are in the first instance nominated by the Governor for a period of five years. Appointments to fill any vacancies which may occur are made by the Governor in Council, by whom also the President is appointed. But it is lawful at any time after four years from the date of the first meeting of the Council for the Legislature to pass a law providing for the election of members of the Legislative Council. Members of the Council must be of the age of 30 years or upwards, must have resided in the Colony for three years, and must possess the electoral qualification. The Legislative Assembly contains 69 members, of whom 34 represent the Witwatersrand area. Members are returned throughout the Transvaal by single-member constituencies, but the old magisterial districts are retained as separate units, and sub-divided where a district is entitled to more than one member, the divisions following as far as possible the boundaries of the old field countries or magisterial wards. Every white male British subject is entitled to be registered as a voter if he has resided in the Transvaal for six months, either immediately before the framing of the register or within three years, in case of temporary absence during those six months. The qualification for membership of the Assembly is the same as the voter's qualification. There is an automatic re-distribution of seats, on a voters' basis, at the end of every four years. The Legislative Assembly and any elected Legislative Council are dissolved at the end of five years, or earlier at the option of the Governor. The Speaker of the Assembly is elected by the members, and will on election vacate his seat. The language of debate in the Legislature will be either English or Dutch, the language of record being English, while copies of votes and proceedings, and of all proposed laws, will be printed in both languages, in accordance with the practice observed in Cape Colony. It is provided that, in the event of disagreement between the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the Governor may convene a joint sitting of the members of both Houses, presided over by the Speaker of the Assembly, when the matter at issue shall be decided by an absolute majority of the members of both Houses. Members of the Legislature receive as payment for their services a fixed sum of £150 and £2 a day for each day of attendance up to a maximum of £300 in any one year. The Legislature has power to alter or repeal any of the provisions of the Letters Patent, but any bill effecting such repeal or alteration must be reserved.

A special clause in the Letters Patent provides that whereas it is His Majesty's will and pleasure that all persons within his dominions shall be free from any conditions of employment or residence of a servile character, the Governor shall reserve any law providing for the introduction into the Colony under contract, indenture or licence of labourers from places outside South Africa.

Another clause provides for the termination of the system of labour deriving effect from "The Labour Importation Ordinance, 1904," and all Ordinances amending the same, at the end of one year from the date of the first meeting of the Legislature. Under this clause no licence can be issued for the introduction of labourers into the Colony under the Ordinance, and no contract can be renewed under its authority after the commencement of the Letters Patent. The Legislature of the Colony may accelerate the determination of the said system of labour or regulate it subject to the conditions of the Letters Patent, and may provide for all necessary matters and for carrying into effect the declarations and enactments of the Letters Patent in that behalf.

Provision is made in regard to the interests of the natives by enacting that no lands which have been or may hereafter be set aside for their occupation shall be alienated or diverted from this purpose, except by legislation which will be liable to be reserved for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure. The Governor will continue to exercise over all Chiefs and natives in the Colony the authority vested in him as paramount Chief, and the Governor in Council is empowered to convene an assembly of native Chiefs to enable the natives to make known their views on questions affecting their interests.

Special provision is made in the Letters Patent with regard to the Land Settlement scheme which was established during the period of Crown Colony government. The Governor was to appoint and control for five years a Land Board consisting of three members, which will be a body corporate, and will exercise the rights and duties conferred, and imposed upon the Government of the Transvaal in respect of the existing settlers by any Law or Agreement.

To this Land Board were to be transferred all lands and movable property held by existing settlers and any sums approved by a Secretary of State out of moneys hereafter appropriated by the Inter-Colonial Council for Land Settlement purposes. The Government of the Colony may (subject to the consent of the Governor, and with the approval of the Secretary of State) come to an agreement with the Board for determining the functions of the Board at an earlier date.

The arrangement under which the Inter-Colonial Council has administered certain services common to the Transvaal and Orange River Colony was to be liable to be terminated on the motion of either Colony. This termination was carried out (see under Railways).
Customs Union.

On 23rd March, 1903, a Customs Agreement was signed, under which the Transvaal and Southern Rhodesia entered the Customs Union, the result being that a common tariff was established for all the South African Colonies. All transit dues were abolished, and considerable reductions were made in through railway rates. The list of South African products which are carried over the railways at preferential rates—this constituting a second line of Protection—was reduced from 110 to 58 articles. A rebate is granted on articles manufactured in the United Kingdom of 25% of the duty in certain cases and of the whole duty in those cases where it is 2½ ad valorem (ironmongery, etc.) ; a similar rebate may be made to any British colony giving equivalent reciprocal privileges to the Union. This Union was superseded by a new Agreement in 1906, which provided for a general increase in the Customs duties. The Agreement maintained the principle of preference for imports from the United Kingdom and reciprocating Colonies, a rebate equal to the increase in the duties being granted on such imports.

Local Government.

Municipal Government was established throughout the Colony by Ordinance enacted in 1903, as extended and amended in 1904, 1905 and 1906. These Ordinances give Local Authorities very extensive powers—interference by the Government being practically limited to powers of audit, the limitation of local loans, the approval of schemes for municipal works and the alienation of municipal property. The basis of municipal qualification is the ownership of real property to the value of £100, or the tenancy of premises of the value of £300, or annual value of £24, but the franchise is not extended to aliens or to coloured British subjects. Thirty-five municipalities have already been established, and considerable progress in the improvement of the towns has been made.

The integral unity of the Witwatersrand area has been recognised by the establishment, under Ordinance No. 48 of 1904, of the Rand Water Board, composed of representatives of the six Municipal Councils in the area and of the Chamber of Mines, which is charged with the task of obtaining water for and supplying it in bulk to its constituent authorities; and further by the creation under Ordinance No. 9 of 1906 of the Rand Provisional Joint Committee, composed of representatives of the Municipal Councils within the area, with the duty of dealing with Hospital matters, the prevention of epidemic diseases in the area and the upkeep of the Main Reef Road—a main trunk road traversing practically the whole of the area.

Local Self-Government in rural districts has not yet been inaugurated, though in hospital matters provision is made for the formation of Joint Committees representative of Urban and Rural Committees, and further legislation was enacted in 1905 and 1906 providing for the creation of Health Committees where the density of the population makes it necessary for sanitary measures to be enforced.

In June, 1904, a Commission was appointed to inquire into the financial relations between the Central Government and the various Municipal Governments. This Commission has already issued three reports and will shortly issue its fourth and final report, completing an exhaustive survey of the important subjects which were referred to its consideration. Many of the recommendations of this Commission have already been adopted.

The Occupation Farms Ordinance, 1904, is administered by the Department, as are also several minor Ordinances affecting town lands, etc.

Railways.

The Central South African Railways include the lines of the late Netherlands South African Railway, the late Orange Free State Government Railways, and the line known as the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway, which formerly belonged to a London company. On the 30th September, 1908, the length of open lines in the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies was 2,568 miles, and the Belfast-Lydenburg line (65 miles) was under construction.

At the present time the railway mileage opened and in working is considerably more than double that open in 1898. It is to be remembered, however, that various railway projects were under construction and others under consideration when the war broke out, and the policy pursued since then has therefore been in consonance with the views held of late years by the older inhabitants of the two Colonies.

The first-class single fare from Cape Town to Pretoria is 9½, 7s., 6d., and from Cape Town to Johannesburg 9l., 0s., 2½d., with free conveyance of 100 lbs. personal luggage; the second-class fares from Cape Town to Pretoria and Johannesburg are 6l., 19s., 9½d., and 6l., 13s., 11½d., respectively, with a free allowance of 75 lbs. luggage.

The financial administration of the railways is under the control of the Railway Board, composed of representatives of both the Transvaal and Orange River Colony Ministries and Parliaments.
Native Schools (Aborigines).

The returns for this branch are not yet complete. There are approximately 220 schools, of which 195 have furnished returns showing a total enrolment of 10,725.

Number of Pupils receiving Secondary Education, June 30th, 1908.

| 22 Schools mentioned in Schedule I. of Education Act, 1907 (above Form IV. A)* | 813 |
| 116 Schools under control of Boards, providing education above Standard VI. | 686 |

Finances.

The accounts of the Colony begin practically with the year 1902-3.

| Receipts. | Expenditure. |
|-----------|--------------|
| Ordinary. | Extraordinary. |
| 1902-3 ... £4,683,206 | £5,863,062 |
| 1903-4 ... 4,423,212 | 4,378,204 |

Receipts.

| Ordinary. | Extraordinary. |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1905-6 ... £4,587,165 | £83,066 |
| 1906-7 ... 5,137,123 | |
| 1907-8 ... 4,278,968 | |

Expenditure.

| Ordinary. | Extraordinary. |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1905-6 ... £4,257,646 | £695,849 |
| 1906-7 ... 4,432,767 | 833,928 |
| 1907-8 ... 4,052,676 | 226,292 |

The principal receipts during 1907-8 were:

- Customs: £1,546,444
- Mining Revenue: 1,068,642
- Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones: 379,899
- Native Revenue: 663,277
- Stamp Duties: 154,767
- Transfer Duty: 173,469
- Land Revenue: 69,801
- Taxes on Trades and Professions: 149,715

The extraordinary expenditure figures include an amount of 30,000l. for the extirpation of cattle disease; 38,647l. purchase of hypothecated properties bought in; 21,500l. relief works—unemployed; 38,557l. expropriation of Pretoria Mint; 67,776l. Selati Railway Debentures redeemed.

In addition to the above-mentioned revenue expenditure issues there were the following loan expenditure issues:

- Land Settlement: £80,075
- Public Works: 109,283
- Transvaal Land & Agricultural Bank: 500,000
- Agricultural Settlement and Development: 8,219

During Mr. Chamberlain's stay in Johannesburg, an arrangement was made between him and a large representative body of the colonists that a loan of 35,000,000l. should be issued, guaranteed by the Imperial Government, and secured on the general revenue of the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies, bearing interest at 3% per annum, with a sinking fund of 1%. It was understood that the proceeds of this loan would be used for the extinction of liabilities, the purchase of public works and railways, and other local requirements.

It was further understood that a further loan of 30,000,000l., bearing interest at 4%, should be issued, and that the proceeds of this loan should be paid to the Imperial Government as a contribution towards the cost of the war. This issue was to take place in three instalments of 10,000,000l., at an interval of at least twelve months between each, and the first instalment was to be raised about January, 1904, the success of this issue being guaranteed by certain South African firms. The loan was to be a charge on the general revenue of the Transvaal.

The necessary legislation having been passed in the Imperial Parliament and the local Legislature, the first of these loans, to the extent of 30,000,000l., was issued (at par) in May, 1903. Throughout this and subsequent years, however, there was considerable depression in the Colony, and His Majesty's Government did not press for the raising of the second or war loan.

His Majesty's Government, in granting Responsible Government to the Transvaal in 1906, announced their intention of abandoning their claim on the Transvaal for the 30,000,000l. war loan.

The balance of the 35,000,000l. loan (5,000,000l.) was raised about the middle of 1904. This loan was put up to tender, and realised an average price of 98l. 10s. 3d. By that time the whole of the first issue had been practically expended, counting in the amounts earmarked for definite impending liabilities—such as the redemption of the shares of the Netherlands Railway Company. The issues from loan funds were as follows in June, 1907:

| Head I. Existing liabilities of Transvaal and O.R.C.: |
| (a) Deficit of Transvaal, 1901-2: | 541,510 |
| (b) Former debt of South African Republic: | 2,500,380 |
| (c) Compensation to Loyalisits in Cape Colony and Natal: | 1,560,852 |
| **Total:** | 4,602,742 |

| Head II. Acquisition of Railways: | 13,077,619 |

| Head III. Repatriation and Compensation— |
| (a) Advances by way of loan: | 2,693,759 |
| (b) Other charges: | 4,513,729 |
| **Total:** | 7,207,488 |

| Railways— |
| (a) Construction of New Railways: | 3,818,308 |
| (b) Rolling Stock and Workshops: | |
| (c) Improvement of existing Railways: | 1,542,000 |

| Land Settlement— |
| (a) Transvaal: | 1,219,925 |
| (b) Orange River Colony: | 1,246,000 |

| Public Works— |
| (a) Transvaal: | 1,290,717 |
| (b) Orange River Colony: | 500,000 |

| Balance: | 9,616,949 |

| **Total:** | £35,000,000 |

The heavy task of repairing the ravages of war and relieving the necessities of all classes of
people in the new Colonies was dealt with from four funds, viz:—

1. The 3,000,000l. mentioned in the Terms of Surrender, and paid as a free grant from Imperial funds.

2. 5,000,000l. appropriated for "repatriation and compensation" from the guaranteed loan. This amount was fully spent by the middle of 1904, and has since been largely over-spent. The expenditure at 30th June, 1907, after allowing for credits received from debts to the fund liquidated from the 3,000,000l. grant, and sundry repayments of advances, amounts to 7,207,489l., of which 2,693,759l. represent advances repayable in the course of three years.

3. 2,000,000l. allotted to compensation to "British subjects, foreign subjects, and natives." This, like (1), was a free grant from Imperial funds. More than half of it was paid by the 30th April, 1904, to persons who had suffered losses from the war, at the rate of 13s. 4d. in the pound on their assessed losses, and the final instalment of 4s. in the pound brought the rate up to 17s. 4d., a very remarkable degree of compensation. 300,000l. was set aside for the compensation of natives.

4. 2,000,000l. paid by the War Office for disbursement to the "protected burghers," being men to whom the military authorities had incurred some special obligation.

To this was added a further sum of 2,500,000l. to discharge the military receipts given during the war. This must be distinguished from the previous funds, as it was required for the payment of debts which formed part of the expenses of the war; the payments, however, in common with those under the previous heads, assisted the people to re-build, re-stock, and make a fresh start in their occupations. The amount actually paid has slightly exceeded the 2,500,000l.

Thus the total amount provided for relief was 14,500,000l., of which 2,500,000l. was in payment for goods received.

When the guaranteed loan was about to be issued, several difficulties arose as to the allocation of the proceeds, as there were various matters in which both of the new Colonies were interested, and it was accordingly decided to treat the railways as the joint property of the two Colonies, and to establish a common fund for that and the like common services. For these purposes the Inter-Colonial Council was constituted. (See under "South Africa.") The revenue of this body for the year 1905-6 was 6,752,629l., which included railway receipts of 5,855,232l., and contributions from the Transvaal and Orange River Colony of 849,668l., the arrangement being that these contributions are (unless the Secretary of State decides otherwise) to be in proportion to their respective customs receipts for the preceding year. The expenditure was 6,752,629l., the principal items being:—Service of guaranteed loan, 687,710l.; South African Constabulary (about 5,000 men), 1,019,834l.; Central South African Railways, 4,940,465l.

Mining.

The Transvaal stands at the head of the gold-producing countries of the world. The production, which in 1887 amounted to a value of 169,401l., rose steadily until 1898, when it reached a value of 16,240,630l. The following are the values for recent years:—

| Year | Ounces | £     |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1903 | 2,972,897 | 12,628,057 |
| 1904 | 3,773,517 | 16,028,883 |
| 1905 | 4,901,541 | 20,854,440 |
| 1906 | 5,792,823 | 24,606,336 |
| 1907 | 6,450,740 | 27,400,292 |
| 1908 |        | 29,957,610 |

The total output of the Transvaal from 1884 to December, 1907, was valued at 197,078,330l. Almost the whole production is from reef, the alluvial gold being inconsiderable in amount.

In 1897, the average number of persons employed by gold mines was 9,530 whites and 69,127 natives. These numbers rose to 12,000 and 107,000 just before the war in 1899, but then fell to about 10,000 and 45,000 in December, 1902. In June, 1908, the whites numbered 18,181 and the natives 147,557. The wages in 1906 were from about 15s. to 33s. per shift for skilled white workmen, and 52s. monthly for natives; the latter are also provided with housing and food.

Chinese labourers were imported under an Ordinance (17 of 1904) passed in February, 1904. At the end of 1905 the further issue of licences for the importation of these labourers was arrested by His Majesty's Government, and subsequently, on the promulgation of the Transvaal Letters Patent, provision was made for the repatriation of all Chinese labourers on the expiration of their contracts. The first batch of Chinese to be repatriated in terms of this condition left the country at the end of June, 1907. The month of January, 1907, shows the highest number (viz. 53,856) of Chinese in the employ of mines, whilst in June, 1908, there were 21,460 Chinese.

During the year ended 30th June, 1908, the Transvaal produced copper ore value 33,132l.; tin ore, 78,589l.; galena, 21,344l.; lime, 52,474l.; other base minerals, 30,018l.; and the silver contained in the gold bullion exported was valued at 88,297l.

The Premier (Transvaal) Diamond Mining Company still maintains its position as one of the largest diamond producers of the world; its production up to the end of June, 1908, being 5,883,230 carats. The total value of the diamonds produced in the Transvaal since the war is as follows:—

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1901-2 | 1,199 |
| 1902-3 | 46,358 |
| 1903-4 | 685,720 |
| 1904-5 | 1,198,530 |
| 1905-6 | 968,229 |
| 1906-7 | 2,263,511 |
| 1907-8 | 1,879,551 |

In 1905 the output of coal was 2,606,799 tons (of 2,000 lbs.), valued at 846,272l.; 1907, 2,883,423 tons valued at 773,649l., and for the six months ending June, 1908, 1,436,738 tons, valued at 381,354l.
