TASMANIA.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide, the important colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 33' and 43° 39' S. lat., and 148° 39' and 148° 23' E. long.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Diemen's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1853. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British possessions, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian States.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1907 the highest shade temperature recorded was 96° 2' on Dec. 26th, and the lowest 30° 5' on the 7th June. The mean range for the year was 65° 7'. In 1907 rain fell on 166 days in the year, and the rainfall was a little more than 25.92 inches.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 2,027 miles of telegraph (with 3,783 miles of wire) open in the State. This excludes 432 miles of cable belonging to the Tasmanian Cable Company. The total cost of telegraph and telephone construction up to 31st Dec., 1907, was £211,283l., the receipts for telegraphs in 1907 being £18,994/. There are also 1,850 miles of telephone, which yield an annual rental of £13,426/.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The number of messages sent was 559,882, of which 270,481 were cable.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Launceston three times a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney twice a week. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and Melbourne, and Hobart and New Zealand every week. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamers from Sydney calling for fruit, also carry passengers. The steamer with mails from Melbourne to Colombo and London every week; time 32 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 40 days. The mail steamer via Vancouver, once a month. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Batavia, Aden, and Brindisi every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 55 days. Direct communication is also afforded by the steamers of the Shaw, Saville Co. and New Zealand Shipping Co., one vessel of each Company calling at Hobart every 2 weeks.
In addition to the above, mails are deposited by Messageries Maritimes de France and by German Line packets once a month.

There are 375 (in addition to 31 receiving offices and 2 travelling offices) places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

- Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers,
  - Within Metropolitan District (13 miles radius from G.P.O.) 1d. ... ¼d.
  - Within Australasia ... ... 2d. ... ... ¼d.
  - Europe, United States, &c., ... 2d. 1d. per 4 oz and ¼d. every additional 2 oz.

The number of letters and postcards received and despatched was 14,910,930; packets and newspapers, 14,510,755.

**Area.**

The State contains 26,215 square miles, the main island containing about 15½ million acres of land, and the smaller islands connected with it 1½ million acres; 5,630,898 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown, leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 11,174,102 acres, of which 1,253,754 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass' Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group, including Flinders Island, Robins Island, King Island, and Bruni and Maria Island on the east coast.

**Roads.**

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the State, and is maintained in fair order by the various road trusts. All the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the Treasury. In 1906 the maintenance of main roads cost £8,025/., of cross and bye roads £1,870/., in all £9,895/.

**Railways.**

There are now 619 miles of railway in the State, constructed mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. Of these 619 miles, 463½ belong to Government, and cost £3,977,610/., and 155½ miles to private companies, and cost £1,127,143/.. The total cost of railway construction up to time of last balancing was £5,070,268/., the gross receipts in 1907 being £376,806/., and the working expenses £256,022/., showing a return of 2¾ per cent. on the capital.

**Land.**

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1½ an acre; the upset price of second-class lands a sum not less than 1½ an acre; and of third-class land a minimum of 5½ per acre.

Under the Crown Lands Act, 1903 (3 Ed. VII., No. 39), any person of the full age of 18 years may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of first-class land not exceeding 200 acres, at 1½ an acre; 250 acres of second-class land, at not less than 1½ per acre; and 400 acres of third-class land, at not less than 5½ per acre, with one-third added for credit, payable by annual instalments for 14 years. First-class lands must be resided upon for 5 years and improved to the value of 1½ per acre before grant can issue, or any person of the age of 18, who has not already selected or purchased under that Act, may take up land, not less than 15 acres, or more than 50 acres, and beyond a deposit of 2½ per acre, no further payment is to be made until the fourth year. But a grant cannot be issued for the land unless improved to the extent of 1½ per acre and resided upon for 5 years, inclusive of the 3 years' free occupation. Second-class lands must be improved to a value of 5½ per acre, and third-class lands to a value of 2½ 6½ per acre, before grant can issue therefor.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15½.

**Industry.**

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, copper, hides, skins, and leather, hops, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark.

The land in crop on 1st March, 1908, was 257,028 acres and 465,673 acres permanently artificially sown grasses. There were in the State 215,523 horned cattle, and 1,748,800 sheep.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, which are now being turned to good account. Gold, silver, copper, tin, coal, wolfram, and also other minerals are found throughout the island. The principal goldfields are at Beaconsfield, Lefroy, and Mathinna. At Beaconsfield the Tasmania Mine is the main producer. Since the reef was discovered in 1877 up to 31st December 1907, this mine has produced 670,893 ozs. of gold, and the total amount paid in dividends is £72,672/.. At Lefroy several mines are sinking, driving, &c., the total output for the year ending 31st December, 1907, being 819 ozs. At Mathinna the chief mine is the New Golden Gate, which is being opened out at 1,600 feet level, and the shaft sunk another 200 feet. The total quantity of gold obtained from this mine is 227,417 ozs., value £855,328/., and total amount paid in dividends £355,200/.. Silver is found on the west and east coasts. Several large silver mines are in full operation at Zeehan and Dundas, and a smelting plant erected at Zeehan, costing over £7,000/., is now treating a large quantity of ore produced. Total quantity of silver lead ore produced during the year ending 31st December, 1907, amounted to 89,762 tons, value £572,500/.. Copper is also found, chiefly on the west coast, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company's mine being a large producer. This company has its own smelting and reduction plants, and for the year ending 31st December, 1907, produced 8,247 tons of blister copper, value £832,691/., (ex. value of gold contained). Tin is obtained in various parts of the island, the principal workings being at Mount Bischoff in the north-west and Braunholm and Mount Cameron in the north-east. The Mount Bischoff Company produced during the year ending 31st December, 1907, 730 tons, and paid in dividends £36,000/., making a total of £2,124,000/., distributed amongst the shareholders. Coal deposits exist more or less throughout the State, the principal mines being the Cornwall and Mount Nicholas in the northeastern part. Output for the year ending 31st December, 1907, 58,891 tons, value £26,500/., at pit mouth.

Hobart and Launceston are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1906, 225 vessels, of 18,203 aggregate net tonnage.

**Population.**

The population in 1881 was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females.
On 5th April, 1891, the population of Tasmania was 146,667, of whom 77,560 were males, and 69,107 females, being 5·60 persons to the square mile. On 31st March, 1901, the population was 172,475, of whom 89,624 were males, and 82,851 females, being to the square mile 5·05. The death-rate of 1904 was 11·04 to the 1,000 of the population. The number of inhabited houses not including tents (1,013) was 31,046. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds (157).

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing within the Registration boundary 41,610 inhabitants.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the State, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 24,536.

Local Government.

The original of this form of Government was superseded in 1907 by the "Local Government Act" which divided the State into 49 municipalities, exclusive of Hobart and Launceston (founded in 1855). The former 49 municipalities are made up of wards, each receiving its own representatives. The Presidents of the Councils are called wardens, and are elected annually. The functions of the old town boards, road trusts, etc., are now merged into the new municipalities. Every elector of the municipality who is a resident or has a place of business therein is eligible to be elected as a councillor for so long as he continues to reside or to have a place of business in the municipality. Every male or female of the age of 21 years whose name is on the assessment roll as the owner or occupier of any property within the municipality, is entitled to vote in the election of councillors. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, Table Cape, Leven, and Strahan, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards. The total revenue of these various bodies, exclusive of Government grants, in 1906 was 275,230l., and the expenditure 271,672l.

The outstanding local debt on 31st December, 1906, was 1,043,668l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are five banks established in the State—viz., The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, with, together, 40 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1907, amounted to 3,906,827l., deposits 3,691,568l. The note circulation on same date amounted to 161,016l.

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the State, established by Government in connection with the Post Office Department, total deposits at time of last balancing being 1,560,951l.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1887 the board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a Director of Education, working under the Minister of Lands as Ministerial head. The system is national and compulsory, but free only to children unable to pay fees, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 360 State schools in operation on 31st December, 1907, the number of scholars on the rolls 25,157, and the average attendance 14,464.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and higher course of education amongst the youth of the State, the University of Tasmania was established in the year 1890, with power to grant scholarships. In all eight scholarships are now awarded annually.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17), constituting "the Parliament of Tasmania," and various amending Acts.

The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as nine members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council nor any person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers) nor contractors to Government. The qualification for a member is to be 30 years of age, and to be a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 10l. or leasehold of 30l. annual value, or being a graduate of any University in the British Dominions, or Associate of Arts of Tasmania, or qualified legal or medical practitioner, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy, or retired officer of the Tasmanian Volunteer Force.

The House of Assembly consists of 35 members, elected for 35 electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court, a person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers), nor a contractor to Government.

The duration of the Assembly is three years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to be a British subject, 21 years old, and resident for 12 months. The Franchise is extended to women. Voting by ballot is regulated by 1st Ed. VII., No. 57. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for about four months. Members, excepting Ministers and certain officers of Parliament, are paid 100l. Members of the Commonwealth Parliament are disqualified for a seat in either House, and a Minister of the Crown under the Commonwealth cannot hold a post as Minister in Tasmania.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,972,578 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places. That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other States of the group, that it now contains 30 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The enumerated population, at the date of the census, 31st March, 1901, was 1,201,341, viz., 603,883 males and 597,458 females. These numbers give a proportion of 98·9 females to 100 males. The estimated population on 31st Dec., 1907, was 1,258,140, viz., 631,140 males and 627,000 females.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 577 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and
by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number 1,656. The postal and telegraph revenue was $819,423.7$ in 1907, and the expenditure $687,915.7$.

Victoria, with the other Australasian States, having joined the Universal Postal Union from 1st October, 1891, the rates of postage are now uniform for all countries outside Australasia.

There are 3,401 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1907, was $41,547,233.7$. The revenue for 1906-7 was $4,022,231.7$, and the expenditure $2,370,695.7$.

There are 7,008 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 15,326 miles of wire; also about 41,391 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1907 was 2,567,289. There are 40 telephone exchanges in the State, with 12,935 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1907 was $255,052.7$.

Stage coaches run to all parts of the State where railway communication is not available.

**Climate.**

From its geographical position Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other State of Australia. In regard to heat the weather is never severely oppressive, except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was $57.3^\circ$; the mean atmospheric pressure at 913 feet above the sea level was 29.93 inches; rain falls on the average upon 131 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25.59 inches.

**History.**

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonisation, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by Acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year an attempt was made to colonise the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the (as yet) unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements, but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when, on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose
amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 3rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is grazing and agriculture, 412,823 acres being under cultivation in 1907-08. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 1,847,121 acres, producing 12,100,780 bushels; oats, 398,749 acres, producing 3,201,408 bushels; barley, 63,074 acres, producing 1,039,295 bushels; potatoes, 54,149 acres, producing 135,110 tons; and hay, 682,194 acres, producing 682,370 tons. About 26,405 acres were devoted to the culture of the vine, producing 1,365,900 gallons of wine, 68,617 cwt. of raisins, and 10,440 cwt. of currants. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. The dairying industry has made rapid strides in the last few years; in 1907 there were produced 63,746,354 lbs. of butter (of which 42,578,114 lbs. were exported) and 4,307,909 lbs. of cheese. On the 31st March, 1908, there were in the State 24,048 horses, 1,842,807 (including 709,279 milch cows) cattle, 14,146,734 sheep, and 211,002 pigs. The wool exported in 1907 amounted to 167,506,728 lbs., valued at 7,372,148L. The amount of gold raised in 1907 was 754,270 ozs., making a total since 1851 of 69,956,448 ozs., valued at 279,471,595L. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the State will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of coal raised in 1907 was 38,634 tons, valued at 79,731L. The chief imports other than wool and gold (which comprise nearly half of the total), are grain and flour, butter, hides and skins, meats, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, oil, tea, and iron. Melbourne does 87 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Todonga, Wahgunyah, Yarrawonga, Gooramadida, Moondrook, Tocumwal, Cobram, Mildura, and Ivan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1907 numbered 369, with a total tonnage of 25,119.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments employing four hands or upwards, except when machinery worked by steam or other power is employed, and except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special mention. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on therein; were this done, the manufacturers of the State might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. The following is a statement of the number and nature of manufactories and hands employed therein during 1907:

| Nature of Industry | Number of Manufactories | Hands employed |

Total | 4,530 | 90,903

The total number of all establishments is 4,530, of which 1,997 use steam or gas engines, the total horse power of which is 47,461. They employ 90,903 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is 15,148,100L. The value of materials used was 18,632,439L., and of articles produced or work done 30,399,945L. The wages paid amounted to 5,982,677L.
The estimated value of Victorian production in 1907 was as follows:

| Production Type                  | Value       |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Agricultural Production          | £8,375,454  |
| Pastoral and Dairying Production | £12,165,276 |
| Mining Production                | £3,147,059  |
| Forest                           | £635,170    |
| Miscellaneous Production         | £1,738,824  |
| **Total Primary Products**       | **£26,061,783** |
| Manufacturing—value added during process | **£11,212,871** |
| **Total**                        | **£37,274,654** |

**Irrigation.**

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other States. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. By the Water Act of 1905 all existing irrigation trusts, with one exception, were abolished, and their works and duties transferred to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. The capital expenditure on the irrigation works controlled by the Commissioners on the 30th June, 1907, amounted to £1,867,122. The Commission is empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation under their jurisdiction; the net area of which, was 2,702,180 acres, the total area irrigated being 160,574 acres. In addition to the foregoing there is the Mildura Irrigation Colony, the lands, works, and approaches of which are controlled by the First Mildura Irrigation Trust. From time to time the Government has assisted the Mildura Trust until on the 30th June, 1907, the total amount advanced was £8,700, which, together with interest accumulated to that date (17,729/.), represents the total indebtedness of the Trust to the Government.

**Chief Towns.**

Melbourne, the capital, at the end of 1907, had a population of 538,000. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (48,607), Bendigo (44,458), Geelong (28,021), Warrnambool (6,600), Castlemaine (8,530), Maryborough (5,903), and Stawell (5,300).

**Coloured Immigrants.**

With a view of restricting the immigration of Asiatics and other coloured persons, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, which provides that any person, who, when asked to do so by a public officer, fails to write out from dictation and sign in the presence of the officer, a passage of fifty words in any prescribed language, is prohibited from landing in Australia. Certificates of exemption are granted in certain cases, and members of the military and naval forces, as well as the master and crew of any public vessel of any government, are excepted. There are not more than 6,500 in the State.

**Banking and Currency.**

The following banks had branches, numbering about 608 in all, throughout the State during the last quarter of 1907:—The Bank of Australasia; of New South Wales; of New Zealand; of Victoria; Colonial of Australasia; Commercial of Australia; English, Scottish and Australian; London of Australia; National of Australasia; Royal of Australia; and the Union of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to £38,247,289/., and the value of the notes in circulation to £889,357/.

There are also 56 banks and branches, with 329 agencies at Post Offices of the Savings Bank. The number of accounts open on the 30th June, 1907, was 491,318, and the amount on deposit was £12,792,500/. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of about £4,000,000/ is coined annually.

**Education.**

Education establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education; private schools for both primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognised in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1907 was 980. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1907, the total number of students who matriculated was 5,645, and 3,651 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, embrace 3 Schools of Art, 10 Schools of Mines, 1 College of Domestic Economy, and 2 Working Men's Colleges; there are also 2 Agricultural and 1 Horticultural College. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes, open to women as well as men; the number of students enrolled in the fourth term of 1907 was 2,204.

The system of primary public instruction, which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14, and State instruction is granted free of cost. In 1906-7 there were 1,974 State schools, with a total enrolment of 231,759 scholars, instructed by 4,721 teachers. The average attendance was 147,270. In 1906-7 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was £86,106/. There is no local control over the schools.
The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1906-7, there were 751 private schools in Victoria, with 2,313 teachers, and an attendance of 48,803 scholars. Of these the Roman Catholic denomination had about one-fourth, about one-third of the teachers, and over half the scholars.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is the official head of the Legislature, and assents in the name of the Crown to Acts passed by the Parliament. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 34 members elected for 17 Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 65 members returned by 65 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

The constitution of the two Houses and the qualification of Members and Electors have been amended on several occasions; and a Reform Act received the Royal Assent on 26th November, 1903. By this Act the number of Members of both Houses was reduced, the franchise for the Upper House broadened, and the property qualification for membership reduced, and several other reforms made. In 1907 an Act was assented to abolishing the separate representation of railways and public officers in the Parliament of the State—one of the provisions of the Reform Act of 1903. Officers in the service of the Government are, however, forbidden to take any part in the political affairs of the State otherwise than by recording a vote, and are prohibited from using any influence in respect to any matter affecting their remuneration or position in the public service.

One of the two Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every three years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council, except in case of a deadlock between the two Houses. The property qualification of members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of £50. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10/- per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 15/- annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British Dominions, matriculated students of the University of Melbourne, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated school-masters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered. By the Reform Act of 1903 the Council is now empowered to suggest alterations in these Bills.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage virtually exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. Plural voting was abolished by an Act passed in August, 1899, so far as the election of members of the Assembly is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is, under ordinary circumstances, three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856, and by an Act passed in October, 1900, provision is made for voting by post in certain cases.

All members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The members of the Legislative Council are not paid. An Act was passed in December, 1903, limiting the amount which may be expended by candidates for election expenses to 400l. and 150l., for the Council and the Assembly respectively. The purposes for which such expenditure may be incurred are also defined.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,234 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the State. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality, except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1906-7 there were 60 cities, towns, and boroughs and 146 shires. The number of ratepayers was 329,393; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 12,638,900l.; representing a value in fee simple of 232,725,666l.; the total income in 1907 (including 117,504l. received from Government) was 1,504,431l., and the expenditure was 1,534,473l.; whilst their loan indebtedness amounted to 4,442,713l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1907 was 214,261l., and its expenditure 176,933l. The debt of the Trust at the end of 1907 amounted to 2,000,000l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1906-07 the Board's ordinary revenue was 476,949l., and its expenditure 476,954l., exclusive of 437,330l. from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1907, amounting to 9,639,663l., of which, however, 1,688,663l. was raised in the first instance by the general Government, and is included in the Public Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works in course of construction amounted to 5,501,832l. up to the 30th June, 1907.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities and the Insurance Companies. In 1907 their revenue amounted to 56,386l., their ordinary expenditure to 57,963l., and their debt to 130,000l.
The Melbourne Tramways Trust is a Municipal Corporation, created for the purpose of constructing tramways in Melbourne and suburbs, which it has done at a cost of £1,705,794., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. This debt will be gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a public company, to whom the lines have been let for a period of 30 years. On the 3rd February, 1908, the sinking fund amounted to £1,000,500.
