BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian down to the 54th parallel, thence by summit of Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean—the average breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of coast line over 1,000 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 383,000 square miles, and the population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173, and at that of 1901, 190,000.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and seven in the House of Commons of Canada.
Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and legislative assembly of 42 members on the system of executive administration known as a "responsible government." The assembly is elected for four years, every male adult (British subjects) having resided six months in the province, duly registered, being entitled to vote.

Members receive $1,200 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

Description.

The population is about 260,000, of whom 29,000 are Indians, 13,000 Chinese, and 4,600 Japanese.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream (Japan current) striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains; the climate is for the most part drier, and the snowfall consequently less.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; in 1906 the imports amounted to $15,718,579, and the exports $22,817,578, a remarkable fact considering the number of the population. Exports consist of minerals (chiefly gold, silver, copper and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon, halibut, herrings, whale products and oil), lumber, furs, skins, etc. The figures quoted show an increase in the total trade of the province of ten million dollars in two years.

The mineral production of the Province to the end of 1907 amounts in value to $292,512,483, towards which sum coal has contributed $67,972,511.

A great advance has been made in metalliferous mining; the oldest districts have increased their production, while new fields have been opened up; this advance is clearly shown by the increase in the production since 1896, which is as follows: 1896, $4,257,179; 1902, $12,174,242. Total output of metalliferous mines for 1903, $16,964,084; 1904, $18,377,359; 1905, $22,461,325; 1906, $24,980,546; 1907, $25,882,560. There has been a corresponding increase in the population; some of these new mining districts, which a year or two ago were only inhabited by a few hardy prospectors, are now dotted with active and prosperous mining towns.

The chief towns are Victoria (30,000) and Nanaimo, city and neighbourhood (7,000), the seat of the coal-mining industry on Vancouver Island. On the mainland, New Westminster (9,500), Vancouver (80,000), Rossland (6,100), Trail (2,000), Nelson (6,000), Kaslo (2,000), Sandon (800), Kamloops (2,500), Fernie (3,500), Ashcroft, Revelstoke, and Golden are thriving places. Esquimalt, V.I., is a coaling station, and is the site of a large dry dock.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of the members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in city school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether first, second or third class) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 16 high schools in the Province, employing 42 teachers. The number of schools in operation in 1906-1907 was 392, under 697 teachers, with an enrolment of 30,039 pupils.

The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma nor creed is permitted to be taught.

School districts are formed wherever there are 20 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years available for school purposes.
