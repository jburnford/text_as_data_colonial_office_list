ORANGE RIVER COLONY.

Situation, Area, and Population.

The Orange River Colony lies to the north of the Orange River and Cape Colony, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts.

The population, according to the last census, which was taken in 1904, was 387,315, of whom 142,679 were white.

History.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Moshesh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the rush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of £6,000/- in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted* in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa. On the establishment of Responsible Government, July, 1907, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams became Governor of the Colony.

On the restoration of peace in 1902 Crown Colony Government was established, and continued till 1907, when Responsible Government was granted.

The election of the first Legislative Assembly took place in November, 1907. In accordance with provisions contained in the respective Letters Patent the Governments of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony on 2nd December gave notice the one to the other to terminate the Inter-Colonial Council, and on 1st June, 1908, the Council ceased to exist. In connection with the dissolution of the Council, three Conventions were agreed upon by the two Governments: (1) For the apportionment of the assets and liabilities of the Council; (2) For the future joint working of the Central South African Railways in the two Colonies; and (3) For the payment of pensions to officials of the Inter-Colonial Council.

On 28th October, 1908, the Government offices at Bloemfontein were destroyed by fire, but most of the important records were saved.

Constitution.

Letters Patent providing for the establishment of Responsible Government in the Orange River Colony were issued on June 5th, and promulgated on July 1st, 1907. In their main features the provisions approximate very closely to those of the Transvaal Constitution.

The Legislature consists of two Chambers—namely, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly.

The Legislative Council comprises eleven members, who, in the first instance, are nominated by the Governor. Of these three vacate their seat at the expiration of their third year of office, four at the end of the fifth year, and four at the end of the seventh year. Their places will be filled by persons to be appointed by the Governor in Council, who will hold office for five years from the date of appointment. Appointments to fill casual vacancies are also to be made by the Governor in Council, but such appointments will continue only until the completion of the period for which the retiring member would have held office.

It will, however, be lawful at any time after four years from the date of the first meeting of

* For an account of the events leading up to the war and the war itself, see Transvaal.
the Council for the Legislature to pass a law providing for the election of members of the Legislative Council.

Members of the Legislative Council must not be less than thirty years of age, and must have resided in the Colony for three years, and possess the electoral qualification.

The Legislative Assembly consists of thirty-eight members, of which eleven represent urban and twenty-seven rural divisions. A Bill was passed by the Legislature during the 1908 session, providing for separate representation for the district of Jacobsdal. When the Act comes into force the Legislative Assembly will consist of 39 members. Members are returned for single member constituencies.

The existing magisterial districts are generally retained as separate units, being sub-divided where a district is entitled to more than one member, but in one instance two such districts are amalgamated as one constituency.

In case of subdivision the boundaries of the existing Magisterial Wards are, as far as possible, followed. Every white male British subject is entitled to be registered as a voter if he has resided in the Colony for six months, either immediately before the framing of the register or within three years in case of temporary absence during those six months. The qualification for membership of the Assembly is the same as the voters' qualification. There will be an automatic redistribution of seats, on a voters' basis, at the end of every four years. The Legislative Assembly and any elected Legislative Council will be dissolved at the end of five years, or earlier, at the option of the Governor. The Speaker of the Assembly will be elected by members, and will, on election, vacate his seat.

The language of debate in the Legislature will be either English or Dutch, the language of record being English, while copies of votes and proceedings, and of all proposed laws, will be printed in both languages, in accordance with the practice observed in Cape Colony. It is provided that, in the event of disagreement between the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the Governor may convene a joint sitting of the members of both Houses, presided over by the Speaker of the Assembly, when the matter at issue shall be decided by an absolute majority of both Houses. The Legislature will have power to alter or repeal any of the provisions of the Letters Patent, but any Bill effecting such repeal or alteration must be reserved.

The following Laws must also be reserved—namely, any Law whereby persons not of European birth or descent are subjected to restrictions or disabilities not imposed on persons of European birth, or providing for the introduction under contract, indenture or license of labourers into the Colony from places outside South Africa. Special provision is made with regard to the system of Lands Settlement established under Crown Colony Government. The Governor was to appoint and control for five years a Lands Settlement Board, consisting of three members, which will be a body corporate, and will exercise and discharge the rights and duties conferred and imposed on the Government of the Colony by any Law or agreement in respect of Lands Settlement property and the persons in occupation thereof. The Lands Settlement property will consist of all lands held by settlers at the date of the Board's appointment under the Lands Settlement Ordinances, and all other fixed property in any town or village purchased by the Government out of funds allocated for the purposes of Lands Settlement, all movable property vested in the Government and used in connection with such lands or other fixed property, and all stock required for Lands Settlement purposes.

All such property, together with all moneys paid to the Government by settlers, and held by it on the day of the Board's appointment for or on account of Lands Settlement, and any balance of money appropriated to the Government by the Inter-Colonial Council for Lands Settlement purposes, or which with the approval of the Secretary of State may subsequently be so appropriated, will be transferred to and vested in the Board during its five years' existence.

The Government of the Colony may at any time prior to the termination of the four years (subject to the consent of the Governor and the approval of the Secretary of State) enter into an agreement with the Board for determining the functions of the Board at an earlier date.

Railways.

The railways are worked under the name of the Central South African Railways, and administered by a railway board of five members, three of whom are nominated by the Transvaal Government, and two by the Orange River Colony Government.

The railway system in the Colony consists of:

(1) A main line connecting the Cape Colony ports of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London with the Transvaal, running from Mid Norval's Pont Bridge and Mid Bethulie Bridge to Mid Vaal River Bridge, a distance of 334 miles from Mid Norval's Pont Bridge, the line from East London connecting at Springfontein, a distance from Mid Bethulie Bridge of 28 miles.

(2) The following branch lines:—Springfontein to Fauresmith (57 miles); Hamilton Junction to Beaconsfield (Cape Border) (100 miles); Hamilton Junction to Tempe Cantonments (4 miles); Bloemfontein to Bethlehem (188 miles); Modderpoort to Ladybrand (7 miles); Marseilles to Maseru (16 miles); Smaldeel Junction to Winburg (28 miles); Dover to Parys (20 miles); Wolfhoek to Heilbron (31 miles); Vierfontein to Eastleigh in the Transvaal (10 miles) connecting with the Klerksdorp-Fourteen Streams line, making a total of 823 miles.

To these must be added a line from the Natal border to Kroonstad Junction (178 miles), worked by the Natal Government.

It is also contemplated to construct a line from Wepener to a point on the Bloemfontein-Modderpoort line (about 60 miles), when all parts of the Colony, with the exception of the Vrede district, will be within fairly easy reach of the railway.

Climate.

The Orange River Colony can be separated, roughly, into three divisions—viz., the western, the middle, and the eastern.

The western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile, but requires irrigation.

The middle division, through which the railway runs, holds moisture longer than the western division, and will grow certain crops without irrigation. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock.

The eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of
wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe.

The heat, especially in the middle and western divisions, is great during the months of December, January, and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein, altitude 4,510 feet above the sea, often rising on individual days to 105° and 108° Fahr. At noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 76°7' and the mean minimum 45°8'.

The eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein:

| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May. | June |
|------|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 4°04 | 2°93 | 2°87 | 1°88  | 1°01 | 0°54 |

| 0°44 | 0°42 | 0°87  | 1°37 | 1°32 | 2°33 |

Total for Year ... ... 20°02

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

Public Works.

The practical completion of the programme of works under the Guaranteed Loan Fund and the Treasury Balances has brought the equipment of the towns and villages with buildings to a more satisfactory condition, although much remains to be done in providing new buildings that are required or in replacing obsolete existing buildings.

The full scheme for the new Grey College and University, which is the most extensive the Colony has undertaken, is now well advanced, and the institutions should be fully prepared for the advancement of higher education within the next year.

The new Law Courts of the Colony are well advanced, and a programme of useful public buildings is being dealt with in the current financial year.

A serious disaster to the civil administration of the public business has occurred in the demolition of the Central Government Offices with a large quantity of public records on 28th October last. Severe dislocation of most of the departments has occurred, but the buildings are not beyond reconstruction.

Currency and Banking.

British sterling and the gold of the late South African Republic are legal tender, and accounts are kept in British sterling.

Under the law of the late Orange Free State the National Bank of the Orange River Colony (in which the Government is represented by 70,000£ out of the total share capital of 100,000£), and the Bank of Africa were the only ones that were legally entitled to transact business in the Colony, but banking has since been made free for all banks obtaining the permission of the Government to open branches. The banks at present represented are the National Bank, the Standard Bank, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, the National Bank of South Africa, Natal Bank, and the Netherlands Bank of South Africa.

Notes of all the above banks are in circulation in the Colony.

Industries.

The leading industry of the country is agriculture, inclusive of stock and sheep-farming. The output of coal for the year 1907-8 has increased from 499,590 tons to 524,487 tons. The diamond output, which was expected to be a record one, was disappointing owing to the crisis in the diamond trade. The value of the diamonds produced during the year was £1,051,725£, as compared with £1,222,202£ for the previous year. As a result of the South African Products Exhibition held in London local industries are receiving considerable attention, and branches of the South African National Union, which has for its object the furtherance of South African industries, have been formed in the Colony.

Land Settlement.

The 1908 season has been more favourable for agriculturists, and settlers have generally improved their position. The stock census return for 1907 showed an increase of over 53,000 sheep, over 8,000 cattle, and other stock in proportion, from the previous twelve months. Up to 30th September, 1908, there were 6,900 heads of families, of which 630 are British and 60 Dutch. The new Land Board, appointed by H.E. The Governor under the terms of Letters Patent granting responsible Government to the Colony, took up their duties on October 1st, 1907. The title deeds of 1,043,454 acres of land were transferred to the Board, the remaining unallotted and undeveloped land, amounting to 118,500 acres, passing to the control of the Government. Revenue received from settlers from October 1st, 1907, to September 30th, 1908, amounted to £43,895£. Expenditure during same period in loans to settlers, development of land, administration expenses, etc., £43,511£. There are a number of approved applicants for land under the control of the Board, but only that which reverts to the Board is available.

Education.

The educational policy of the Government is administered through the Education Department. From 1900 to 1905 the schools were managed, teachers were selected and appointed, and all expenditure was borne by the Government. Local Education Committees were established in the towns in 1903, but these were merely advisory bodies. In terms of an agreement come to between the Government and representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church in March, 1905, the Christian National Schools, which had been started a year previously, were amalgamated with the Government Schools.

In 1908 a new School Act was passed and came into force on the 1st November. The principal changes introduced by this Act are as follows:

Fees are payable in respect of pupils at all primary and secondary public schools and aided private schools, provision being made for exemption in necessitous cases. English and Dutch are put on an equal footing as media of instruction in the various subjects of the curriculum, certain modifications being permitted according to circumstances during the first three years after the taking effect of the Act. With the exception of certain high schools, every primary and secondary public school is placed under the supervision of a committee consisting of five or seven members (according to the size and importance of the school) elected by the parents of children attending such school. The
central local control in each district is vested in the District Board, which consists of nine members, the bare majority of whom are elected by the committees within the district, and the rest appointed by the Minister in charge of Education. Religious instruction can only be given by members of the school staff, and dogmatic teaching is prohibited during school hours, except in country schools when parents request that such instruction be given.

On the termination of hostilities in 1902 the total number of pupils attending permanent schools in the Orange River Colony was 1,933. Many children were then receiving instruction in the refugee camp schools. In June, 1903, when all the refugee camps had been broken up, the numbers in attendance at town and country schools in the Colony were 9,031. In June, 1904, the roll was 12,507; in 1905, 15,577; in 1906, 16,338; in 1907, 17,201; and in 1908, 19,502.

Students are prepared for the B.A. and M.A. degrees, Law, Survey, Engineering and Pharmacy Examinations at Grey University College, Bloemfontein, new buildings for which are now in course of erection on an extensive site in the west of the city, where the Grey College School and hostels are already in operation.

A normal school in Bloemfontein provides for the training of teachers, and bursaries are given on the results of an entrance examination held annually in April.

There is also an industrial school in Bloemfontein where orphans and sons of poor parents are maintained and supervised at Government expense, and apprenticed to various trades and industries in the town.

Courses of instruction are also given in agriculture at Grey College, in household economy at Eunice High School, and in cookery, dressmaking, art needlework and millinery in Bloemfontein and at various other centres in the Colony.

Spinning and weaving schools have also been started recently, and have met with a considerable measure of success.

The above statement refers to the education and training of white people only. A small grant is also given annually in aid of the education of natives. This grant is paid to the various religious denominations which undertake the work of native education, and the amount is in proportion to the number of children in the schools. There are about 10,000 native children in these schools.

The Department of Education sustained a severe and irreparable loss in the fire at Government buildings, Bloemfontein, on the 28th October of this year. Its offices were completely destroyed, and all books, correspondence and other valuable records perished in the flames.
