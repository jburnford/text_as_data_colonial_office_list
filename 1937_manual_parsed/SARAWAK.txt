SARAWAK.

General.

In 1864 Great Britain recognized Sarawak as an independent State. An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 442,900 composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 450 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kedurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kedurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1884 another cession was obtained of the Trusun River situated on the north of the mouth of the Brune River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawu River was added in 1908. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Heir presumptive, Bertram Brooke (H.H. the Tuan Muda), born 8th August, 1876.

*Note.—Jelutong gutta is the sap of a fairly common jungle tree. It is said to be shipped mostly to America, and used in the manufacture of paint, chewing gum, and insulating material.

—The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33' 10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses hospitals and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 480 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under four resident priests and a girls' school under the sisters.

The S.P.G., and Roman Catholic Missions have stations at various other places all over the Country.

Sibu, on the Rajang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Mukah, a large town on the Mukah River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to...
carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be ended.

Other towns are Sadong, Lundu, Simanggang, Siong, Saratok, Engkilili, Sarikei, Binatang, Atu, Kapit, Oya, Rejang, Miri, Baram, Limbang, Lawas, Trusan.

Communications.

Vessels of the Sarawak Steamship Company Limited and Straits Steamship Company Limited provide a service every week between Kuching and Singapore. A service between Sibu and Singapore is maintained by the Sarawak Steamship Company Limited, which also provide a fast service.

There are roads around the capital and hence to Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles) and to Sadong (about 40 miles). Internal communication is almost entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.

Posts and Telegraphs.

Sarawak joined the Postal Union in 1897.

Local.—To any place in the country, 5 cents per 2 oz., and 5 cents to Singapore. Inland postcards 2 cents.

**Trans-Jordan**.

A strip of country fringing the Syrian sea and extending from Syria in the north to that of Akaba in the south forms the territory known as Trans-Jordan. It is divided from Palestine by the Rivers Yarmuk and Jordan and the Dead Sea.

The frontier between Nejd and Trans-Jordan starts in the north-east from the point of intersection of meridian 39°E. and parallel 31°N. and proceeds in a straight line to the point of intersection of meridian 37°E. and parallel 31°30'N. and thence along meridian 37°E. to the point of its intersection with parallel 31°25'N. From this point, it proceeds in a straight line to the point of intersection of meridian 38°E. and parallel 30°N., leaving the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan in the Territory, and thence proceeds along meridian 38°E. to the point of its intersection with parallel 29°35'N.

The southern boundary of Trans-Jordan is yet to be defined.

The northern portion of Trans-Jordan consists of elevated country, rising to 3,500 to 4,000 feet above sea level, which on the western margin abruptly to the narrow fertile plain of the Jordan valley, and on the eastern falls more gradually into grass lands through which runs the Hejaz railway line and which gradually merges into the desert.

The grass land strip forms the summer pasture of Bedouin tribes who in the winter move northeast for pasturage. West of the railway are wheat and barley lands of the Kerak, Balqa, Ajlun tribes as well as of the Circassian colonists, the Balqa and the numerous Arab villages to the north. Perennial water is found in the deep valleys which is used for the irrigation of cultiva-land in the valleys themselves, and subsequently waters relatively large areas of the fertile lands of the Jordan depression which are cultivated by semi-nomad tribes. The remainder of the depression is used by these tribes as winter grounds. In the north there are a number of villages, but only towns of any size are Amman, Salt, Kerak and Irbid.

No census has been taken but the population is believed to be between 250,000 and 300,000.

His Britannic Majesty is the Mandate for Trans-Jordan, to which the terms of the Mandate for Palestine, with the exception of the provisions dealing with the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people, are applicable. The declaration of His Majesty's Government with regard to its Mandatory obligations in Trans-Jordan to the Council of the League of Nations in September, 1922 (Cmd. 1788) was in the following terms:

"In the application of the Mandate to Trans-Jordan, the action which in Palestine is taken by the Administration of the latter country, will be taken by the Administration of Trans-Jordan under the general supervision of the Mandate."

His Majesty's Government accept full responsibility as Mandatory for Trans-Jordan and undertake that such provision as may be made for the administration of that country in accordance with Article 23 of the Mandate shall be in no way inconsistent with those provisions of the Mandate which are not by this resolution declared inapplicable."

On the 20th February, 1928, an Agreement between His Britannic Majesty and His Highness the Amir for the purposes of setting up an independent and constitutional Government and placing His Britannic Majesty in a position to fulfil his international obligations in respect of Trans-Jordan was
signed by the representatives of the High Contracting parties and an Organic Law thereupon came into force provisionally, pending the ratification of the agreement after its acceptance by the Legislative council provided for in the Law. The provisions of this Agreement relating to the expenses of the British Resident and his staff, customs duties and consular presentation were amended by a supplementary agreement which was signed at Jerusalem on the 2nd June, 1934.

The Legislative Council, consisting of six official and sixteen elected members, met for the first time on the 2nd April, 1929, and accepted the Agreement during its first session.

The Mandatory is represented in Trans-Jordan by the British Resident, assisted by a few British officers and a small clerical staff. The British Resident acts under the instructions of the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, who is also the High Commissioner for Palestine.

A local Arab Administration has been formed under His Highness the Emir Abdullah ibn Hussain, G.C.M.G., G.B.E. (son of ex-King Hussain of the Hejaz and uncle of King Ghazi of Iraq).

Amman is the capital. Amman, Kerak, Irbid and Ma'an are headquarters of District Governors.

The Ottoman Code is in operation with but few changes. The official language is Arabic.

The system of Turkish taxation, which was most uneven in its incidence, has been replaced by a Land Tax based on a fiscal survey. The Land Tax is assessed at the rate of 6% of the annual revenue of the land. Urban property is subject to a House and Land Tax assessed at the rate of 10% of the rental value.

The Customs Tariff is mainly on a specific basis. The following are the principal articles subject to specific duties:—Cigarettes, Tobacco, Benzine and Kerosene, Flour, Rice, Sugar, Coffee, Cotton, woollen and silk materials, Timber, Rubber Tyres and Tubes, and Matches.

Palestine pays Trans-Jordan an annual sum of £P.17,000 on account of the Customs Duty collected on goods of foreign origin which are re-exported to Trans-Jordan. The Trans-Jordan collects and retains the import duty on goods imported in transit through Palestine. The Syrian Government also refunds the duty collected on articles of foreign origin when re-exported to Trans-Jordan; and Trans-Jordan in addition collects a further small percentage of the value of the goods as assessed at Damascus. Trans-Jordan collects a specific additional excise duty on imported alcohol and tobacco.

Until 1926, public security in Trans-Jordan was maintained by a locally-recruited force known as the Arab Legion and a number of civil police in the larger towns. In 1926 these forces were reorganised. A military force called the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force was raised in Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the defence of the two territories, and police duties in Trans-Jordan were entrusted to a civil police force, to which the old name of the Arab Legion was given.
