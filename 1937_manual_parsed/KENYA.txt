KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the East African coast line from Umba River to Dick's Head, and territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1923, a Commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew in 1893.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays a rent of 10,000l. per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the latter has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 224,960 square miles.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into four Provinces, and three extra-provincial districts.

1. The Nyanza Province, comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho, and Kisumu-Londiani.

2. The Rift Valley Province comprising the districts of Nakuru, Ravine, Baringo, Naivasha, Laikipia, Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo, and Trans-Urzia.

3. The Central Province comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kyambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, North Nyeri, Embu, Meru, Machakos, and Kitui.

4. The Coast Province comprising the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, and Lamu.

5. The Northern Frontier District comprising the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir, and Telenguger.

6. The Turkana District, comprising the districts of Turkana and West Suk.

7. The Masai District, comprising the districts of Ngong and Kajiado.

The Capital of the Colony is Nairobi. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Europeans | Non-Europeans | Natives | Total |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| 1935 |           |               |         |       |
|      | 5,530     | 16,500        | 28,000  | 50,030|

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 50,000, of whom about 800 are Europeans. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours, Mombasa harbour on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the port. A Municipality was established at Mombasa in 1928.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 31st December, 1935, as follows:

| Race          | Number |
|---------------|--------|
| Europeans     | 17,997 |
| Indians       | 38,461 |
| Arabs         | 12,599 |
| Goans         | 3,437  |
| Other non-natives | 1,436 |
| Total non-natives | 71,930 |
| Africans      | 3,012,421 |
| Total         | 3,084,351 |

On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Lumbwa, the Suk, the Turkana, the Masai, the Somalis, and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made some progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Under the Royal Instructions dated the 29th March, 1934, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner, Commissioner for Local Government, Lands and Settlement, Director of Medical Services, the Director of Agriculture, and Director of Education (ex-officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the
Kenya.

Colony shall consist of the Governor as President eleven ex-officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, and two nominated unofficial members to represent the interests of the African community. The ex-officio members are the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate forms one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

East Africa Governors' Conference.

In pursuance of a recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission which visited E. Africa in 1924, a first Conference of Governors of the British East African Dependencies was held in Nairobi in January and February, 1926, for the discussion of matters of mutual concern. It was then decided that a permanent Secretariat for the Conference should be established at Nairobi and conferences held as and when necessary. Subsequently the Joint Select Committee on Closer Union in East Africa recommended that the machinery of the Governors' Conference should be increasingly utilised for the purpose of ensuring continuous and effective cooperation and co-ordination in all matters of common interest to East Africa. As a result of this, it was decided that the Conference should be deemed to be in permanent session with a view to its being convened at any time when necessary, and that there should in any case be an annual meeting of the Governors of Kenya, Tanganyika Territory and Uganda, attended, if desired, by the Governors of Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and the British Resident, Zanzibar. The cost of the Secretariat is contributed in varying proportions by the East African Governments and by the Kenya and Uganda Railway Administration. The Secretary of the Conference is Mr. L. B. Freiston, O.B.E., who is also Secretary to the High Commissioner for Transport, Kenya and Uganda. Salary £500.

Climate.

With the exception of the coast and the immediate interior where the average temperature is about 80°F, the climate of Kenya is cool and invigorating. At Nairobi, the mean temperature is 67°F, the mean maximum being 77°F and the mean minimum 57°F.

There are generally two rainy seasons: the "long rains" of April to June when the greater part of the rain falls, and the "short rains" of October to December. No month is invariably dry, and near Lake Victoria showers occur on most afternoons. The mean annual rainfall on the coast is 40 inches, of which 20 inches may fall in April and May. Inland the rainfall decreases to 10 inches and then increases with altitude to an average of 40 inches over the Highlands. On higher ground and near the Lake average annual totals reach 70 inches.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at 1s. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw from circulation the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a rupee) have been withdrawn from circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a shilling) have been introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Treasurer.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26, Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe, and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London), have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Kitale, Kakamega, in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) with which is amalgamated The National Bank of South Africa Ltd., has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kitale, Eldoret and Kakamega in Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Land and Products.

As the pursuit of agriculture is possible from sea level to altitudes of over 9,000 feet, climatic conditions are extremely varied and tropical, subtropical and temperate crops are grown.

In the highlands, coffee, maize, wattle, tea, wheat and potatoes are the principal crops. Beans, pyrethrum and various kinds of temperate fruits
and vegetables are also grown. In the lower and intermediate areas, sisal, cotton, coconuts, sugar cane, miscellaneous grains and oil seeds are grown.

Extensive pasture grounds exist and maintain considerable numbers of cattle and sheep, grade and native. Butter and cheese are prepared and exports of the former are increasing rapidly. Considerable quantities of hides and skins are exported annually.

Exports of agricultural commodities in 1935 were valued at 2,510,216/.

Whereas considerable quantities of foodstuffs for the non-native population were imported in former years these have now been largely replaced by home produced articles. Local products now comprise not only all the staple articles of diet, but also a wide variety of specialities.

Fishing industries are established on the Coast and on Lake Victoria and provide valuable supplies for local consumption.

The forest products of the Coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony, and gum copal. The highland forests contain large quantities of pencil Cedar and several other good timbers such as Podocarpus, Olive, and East African Camphor, also large areas of bamboo suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.

The following minerals have been located:

Gold has been found throughout the Nyanza Province and in the southern part of Masai Reserve. Traces of gold are widespread in rocks of the basement complex.

Silver is commonly associated with the gold discoveries, and also occurs with base metals in the Coastal Province.

Copper. A copper impregnation in gneiss is being investigated. Elsewhere copper occurs only in very small quantities.

Lead and zinc are found in the Coastal Province.

Asbestos occurs in basement complex rocks at a certain horizon, the best known occurrences being in Machakos and West Suk.

Arsenic occurs in the form of arsenical pyrites in the Nyanza Province.

Barytes is found in the Coastal Province.

Diatomite is found near Gilgil and in many other parts where lacustrine beds occur.

Gypsum has been discovered near Simba.

Iron Magnetite-quartzites occur in the basement complex and form a possible ore for the future.

Ilmenite (Titanium). The sand is abundantly concentrated in the rivers of the Nyanza Provinces.

Limestone. Abundant in Coastal Province. Recrystallized as marble it occurs in enormous quantities near Voi, Kajiado, in Loldaika Hills and in other places.

Manganese occurs in the Coastal Province.

Mica occurs in basement complex rocks. It has been worked in West Suk and in the Ukamba Reserve.

Olivine is concentrated in the rivers draining the Aberdares.

Potash and Soda. These salts are being exploited at Lake Magadi.

Tin. Cassiterite has been discovered in the Trans Nzoia.

Zircon is an abundant constituent in the river beds of Nyanza, but is particularly plentiful in the streams draining the Coastal Range.

The total area of land alienated as at December 31st, 1935, was 6,708,000 acres. In addition, there are 324,480 acres of Township and Government Reserves.

Trade, Customs and Excise.

Under the terms of the Congo Basin Treaties equality of treatment in respect of imported goods irrespective of origin is ensured, and the grant of Imperial Preference is therefore inadmissible. Goods declared as in transit are allowed to be imported and forwarded under Customs control on payment of expenses of administration (6d. per package).

For purposes of Customs, Kenya and Uganda form a single unit and by agreement with the Tanganyika Territory Government a common Tariff has been accepted by the three territories, the free and unrestricted movement within the territories of both imported goods and local products being thus secured.

The Common Tariff, however, includes a small number of "suspended duties" which are of a protective nature and may be imposed by Proclamation either in part or in full in any or all of the territories.

The general duty rating under the Common Tariff is 20 per cent. ad valorem based on the landed value at the port of entry, building materials, artisans' tools, and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on such articles as readily lend themselves to this form of assessment and in certain cases alternative specific or ad valorem charges are levied. Exemption from duty is allowed on drugs and medicines, packing materials, disinfectants, germicides and vermin killers, machinery, and many articles necessary for road construction, sanitation, irrigation and drainage purposes, and for the agricultural, industrial, and educational development of the territories.

The Customs Tariff (Amendment) Ordinance of the 24th October, 1934, introduced modifications of the specific duty ratings on piece goods and certain other textiles, boots and shoes, and bicycles and tricycles, the alternative ad valorem ratings of 20 per cent. being unchanged. The revised ratings are as follows:

| Article | Duty |
|---------|------|
| Apparel and blankets—Blankets. | Each, 30 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Boots and shoes of which the soles are made of rubber and the uppers of canvas and/or leather. | Per pair, 40 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Cardigans, jerseys and pullovers. | Each, 35 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Shirts. | Each, 35 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Piece goods—Cotton, grey and unbleached, not elsewhere specified. | 10 Cents per square yard or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Other (including scarves, shukas, chadders, khangas, bedspreads and the like), made of cotton or admixtures of cotton with other material not elsewhere specified. | 12 Cents per square yard or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Made of silk or artificial silk or of materials containing silk or artificial silk. | 20 Cents per square yard or 20 per cent ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Bicycles and tricycles, n.e.c. | Each, Shs.12, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
Parts and accessories of bicycles and tricycles were removed from the general ad valorem rating of 20 per cent., certain specified parts being subjected to alternative specific ad valorem ratings as follows:

| Article | Duty |
|---------|------|
| Parts and accessories of bicycles and tricycles (not including rubber tyres or tubes when imported separately), viz.: Frames, including front fork and back stay. | Each, Shs. 6, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Frames, excluding front fork and back stay. | Each, Shs. 4, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Front forks. | Each, Shs. 1/25, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Back stays. | Each, 75 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Handle bars (with fittings or otherwise). | Each, Shs. 1/50, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Saddles. | Each Sh. 1, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Rims. | Each, 40 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Chains. | Each, 40 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Other parts | 20 per cent., ad valorem. |

Other minor modifications of the tariff were the transfer to the free list of batching oil and ingredients thereof, and of mineral mixtures for stock feeding containing 70 per cent. of one or more of the following ingredients:—Calcium, phosphoric oxide, iron, iodine.

Under the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Ordinance of the 27th June, 1935, the specific duties on imported tobacco and cigarettes were increased by cents 25 per lb. to Shs. 2/65 per lb., the alternative ad valorem rating of 82½ per cent. remaining unchanged.

The Excise Duties (Amendment) Ordinance, 1935, enacted concurrently with the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Ordinance, 1935, imposed increases in the Excise duties on the locally manufactured tobacco and cigarettes as follows:

- Tobacco, increased from 50 cents per lb. to Shs. 1/25 per lb.
- Cigarettes, increased from 75 cents per lb. to Shs. 1/25 per lb.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of Trade Imports (excluding imports on Government Account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya Ports, were as follows:

| Years | Trade Imports | Trade Exports | Customs Receipts | Tonnage |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------------------|---------|
|       | £             | £             | £                |         |
| 1927  | 7,851,611     | 6,952,718     | 1,176,077        | 1,703,896 |

Communication between the coastal ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co.

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by an Inter-Colonial Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Territory (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On the 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda. It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the Governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway. The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory's representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

The length of the line, which is metre gauge, including branches open to traffic at the end of 1935 is 1,622 miles, excluding loops and industrial sidings.

The Railway Marine consists of the Lake Victoria, Lake Kioga, Lake Albert, and River Nile flotillas. Their respective strengths are as follows:

- **Lake Victoria**: 3 Steamers, total displacement 3,546 tons.
  - 5 Tugs and 1 Launch.
  - 1 motor vessel (Kagera River Service).
  - 31 Lighters, total capacity 3740 tons.

- **Lake Kioga**: 3 Sternwheel Steamers.
  - 1 Launch.
  - 17 Lighters, total capacity 1800 tons.

- **Lake Albert and River Nile**: 4 Steamers, total displacement 1256 tons.
  - 1 Launch.
  - 4 Lighters, total capacity 270 tons.

The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda:

In 1927 the title of the Kenya and Uganda Railway was changed to that of Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and the Administration assumed control of the working of the Port of Mombasa and coastal ports.

The old harbour at Mombasa is now entirely used by dhows. Kilindini Harbour has been the scene of intensive development during recent years, and some 3½ million pounds sterling have been expended there. There is now, in addition to the former lighterage quay, a deep-water quay having a length of approximately 3,000 feet. This quay can accommodate six ships alongside of the normal type using the port. The quay is served by 25 electric level-luffing cranes and there are five transit sheds, three of which are double storey. The total number of quay, shed and stacking ground cranes are 82 up to date. A jetty at which bulk oil ships discharge to tanks ashore is now in use. A Harbour Advisory Board advises the High Commissioner for Transport on Port Matters.

Kilindini Harbour, at the Port of Mombasa is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana, which is navigable for about 400 miles by small shallow draft steamers. The bar at Kipini is an obstacle to navigation from the sea.

The Port of Kilifi consists of a land-locked Harbour, 30 miles North-East of Mombasa. It offers good anchorage for small vessels, and opens out into the Bandari Ya Wali, a bay about one-and-half miles wide, with shallow anchorage.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Kilifi.

The Port of Malindi is an open Harbour, 60 miles North East of Mombasa. Ships of any size can anchor off Malindi, but the anchorage is very exposed to the Monsoons. Cotton, Sim sim, and Copra are exported.

A District Officer resides at Malindi.

About three miles North of Malindi is the mouth of the Sabaki River. This river, which has recently been bridged about a mile from its mouth, passes through a country of great fertility, but is shallow and only navigable by canoes.

The Port of Lamu lies between Lamu and Manda Islands, 140 miles North-East of Mombasa. The town of Lamu, the most important Coast town North of Mombasa, is situated on Lamu Island. There is a good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, but the bar carries only 15 feet at low water. The exports are cocoa-nuts, copra, rope, mat bags, and some cattle.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Lamu.

**Posts and Telegraphs.**

The Post Office of the Colony (exclusive of Uganda and Tanganyika, which are worked by the Kenya Post Office) received and despatched during 1935, 13,507,926 letters, packets, etc., and 405,400 telegrams.

The telegraph and telephone system has 16,214 miles of wire (exclusive of Uganda and Tanganyika).
The lines connect Mombasa with Lamu (166 miles), Kipini with Witu (13 miles), Mombasa to Tanganyika Border (61 miles), Mombasa with Nairobi (331 miles), Voi to Tanganyika Border (81 miles), Konza with Magadi (91 miles), Konza with Machakos (22 miles), Nairobi with Thika (35 miles), Thika with Makuyu (19 miles), Makuyu with Nyeri (58 miles), Nyeri with Nanyuki (32 miles), Nanyuki with Isiolo (110 miles), Nairobi with Kiambu (10 miles), Nairobi with Kijabe (43 miles), Kijabe with Narok (61 miles), Kijabe with Gilgil (39 miles), Gilgil with Thomson's Falls (46 miles), Thomson's Falls with Rumuruti (22 miles), Gilgil with Nakuru (38 miles), Nakuru with Nakuru Junction (5 miles), Nakuru Junction with Kisumu (132 miles), Lumbwa with Kericho (19 miles), Kericho with Chemagei (32 miles), Muhoroni with Songoro (10 miles), Kibigori with Eldoret (54 miles), Kisumu to Uganda Border (89 miles), Nakuru Junction with Eldoret (117 miles), Rongai with Lake Solai (27 miles), Maji Mazuri with Eldama Ravine (6 miles), Eldoret with Moiben (25 miles), Eldoret to Uganda Border (98 miles), Leseru with Kitale (40 miles), Kitale with Endebess (11 miles), Kitale with Kiminini (11 miles), Kapasab with Kakamega (29 miles). Lines follow all Railway routes. Communication between Mombasa and ships at sea and Italian Somaliland is maintained by means of radiotelegraphy. A cable connects Mombasa with Zanzibar. A short-wave wireless station, owned and maintained under licence from Government, by Cable and Wireless Limited, is established at Nairobi and provides communication between the Colony and Protectorate and Great Britain.

Telegraph communication exists with Uganda and Tanganyika Territory. The Kenya telegraph system is also linked up via the Tanganyika Territory, Nyassaland and Rhodesian systems with the South African service. Communication with the Belgian Congo is maintained through Uganda, with which the Belgian Congo system is linked up.

Telephone Exchanges are worked at Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Kitale, Kiambu, Koru, Ruiru, Kabete, Meru, Mitubiri, Molo, Nyeri, Thika, Kericho, Kikuyu, Lumbwa, Limuru, Njoro, Sotik, Soy, Turbo, Gilgil, Makuyu, Naivasha and Rongai. Radio Telephone communication exists between all exchanges in Kenya and Great Britain. There is telephone communication between Nairobi—Dar-es-Salaam and intermediate points.

3,131 telephones were in use in Kenya at the end of 1935.

Civil Aviation.

Civil aviation continues to show rapid development in the Colony.

Government Civil landing grounds exist at 35 of the more important centres of which 20 can only be classed for the present as emergency landing grounds, while 3 (Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu) have been gazetted as Customs Aerodromes.

Licensed privately owned landing grounds are maintained at Eldoret, Nakuru, Kitale, Lolgorien, Lathbury's Njoro and Kitere. In addition there are twelve privately owned unlicensed landing grounds in the Colony and a seaplane base at Kisumu.

Imperial Airways (Africa) Limited, operate a regular bi-weekly service for the transport of passengers, mails and freights between Cairo and Cape Town, and call at Nairobi and Kisumu. At Cairo, the service connects with a similar service to England.

Wilson Airways Limited operate a twice weekly coastal passenger, freight and mail service linking Nairobi and the Cape-Cairo route with Mombasa, Tanga, Zanzibar and Dar-es-Salaam, and a weekly service from Nairobi to Mwanza via Lolgorien and Musoma, as well as charter, ambulance, and instructional services.
