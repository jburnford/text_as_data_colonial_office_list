CAYMAN ISLANDS.

Description.

The Cayman Islands, which form a dependency of Jamaica, consist of three islands—Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac—lying between 79° 83' and 81° 30' W. longitude and 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. latitude, and having a total area of about 104 square miles. They were discovered by Columbus on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession soon after the conquest of Jamaica in the middle of the seventeenth century and the islands were mainly colonised from Jamaica, though many English and Scottish mariners, shipwrecked on the coast of Cuba, settled on the islands.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is considerably larger than in other parts of the West Indies.

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, with a varying breadth from 4 to 7 miles, and has an area of 85 square miles. The total population of the islands is 6,009, of which some 4,592 live in Grand Cayman, where Georgetown, the capital town, with a population of 1,321, is situated.

The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized deep-water harbours.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

The chief industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle—or "turtling," as it is called. These turtles are brought to the island and placed in "crawls" to recover and fatten before export. The demand for turtle showed an increase during 1935 in the American markets, the total number exported being 1,673, valued at 2,059l. The export of shark skins in 1935, 11,962 skins, was valued at 2,532l.

The people are first-class shipbuilders and many fine schooners are built in these islands for local use and sale abroad.

Georgetown is a Port of Registry and 46 sailing vessels and 12 motor vessels, with an aggregate net-tonnage of 3,798, are on the registry of shipping there.

The islands are in some parts fruitful and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable acreage is traversed by honeycombed limestone and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found. Agricultural pursuits are fostered and encouraged by an Agricultural Society.

Many of the islanders find employment on the mainland of America and in foreign vessels, supporting their families in Cayman by remittances from abroad.

An ad valorem customs duty of 12½% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. The revenue derived from these duties amounted to 3,322l. in 1935.

There is a British preferential tariff on certain articles.

Climate.

The climate from November to March is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, but during the summer months, it is hot, with southerly winds. Mosquitoes abound in the summer. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1935 was 61.50 inches, the average annual rainfall being about 55 inches.

The more recent hurricanes at the islands occurred in November, 1932, September, 1917, August, 1909, and August, 1903—previous to this there was a severe hurricane in October, 1876. During 1935 a modern Meteorological Station was erected at Georgetown, and it is expected that observations taken will form an important study of Meteorological phenomena in the Caribbean, especially in connection with hurricanes.

Communications.

A regular motor-schooner service is maintained from Georgetown with Kingston, Jamaica. There is also communication by sailing and motor vessels with the ports of Central America and the United States.

Communications by motorable roads increased considerably during 1935, and every district is now linked up.

The first wireless station to be established in the islands was opened on 23rd November, 1935. The installation, which is very up-to-date, was carried out by Messrs. Cable & Wireless Ltd. The principal tariffs per word are (deferred):—Jamaica, 6d.; United Kingdom, 1s. 5d.; Canada, 1s. 2d.; New York, 1s.

Education.

Education is in charge of a Board of Education which receives an annual grant of 1,500l. from the public revenue. Thirteen public elementary schools are maintained, with a roll of 876 pupils and an average attendance of 779.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 24) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica and these, with 27 elected members, known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly under the presidency of the Commissioner. Elections are held biennially.

The present constitution of this Assembly of Justices and Vestry is 100 years old and the centenary was commemorated by a special issue of postage stamps in 1932.
There is no Public Debt, but a loan of £3,680l. was made by the Government of Jamaica in 1933 to the Dependency to assist it in repairing the damage caused by the hurricane of 1932.

Civil Establishment.

Commissioner and Judge, A. W. Cardinall, C.M.G., furnished house, 500l. to 600l. and fees.
Government Medical Officer, Dr. G. N. Overton, M.D., partly furnished house, 65l. for drugs and travelling, private practice and 300l.
Clerk of Courts, Clerk of the Vestry, and Auditor, A. E. Panton, 150l.
Assistant Treasurer, Collector of Customs and Postmaster, Georgetown, A. C. Panton, 180l.
Collector, Postmaster, etc., Lesser Cayman Islands, A. S. Rutty, 180l., and fees.
Inspector of Police, Bailiff, Grand Court, etc., J. R. Watler, 150l. and fees.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the average quantity annually gathered being about 1,600,000 bushels, equal to 56,000 tons, 522,668 bushels were exported in 1934 valued at 9,780l. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1934, 25,718 lbs., was valued at 1,949l., 1,012,750 dried conchs (shell fish), valued at 935l.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st Dec., 1934, 55 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,204 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

The bulk of the imports (13,106l.) in 1934 out of a total of 21,114l.) are from the U.S. of America. The exports are chiefly to Canada and the United States.

An ad valorem customs duty of 15% is levied on most imports and specific duties on alcoholic liquors, tobacco, flour and a few other articles.

The British preferential tariff is 10%.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 78°, the extreme range being from 60° to 93°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1934 amounted to 31.07 inches, the average rainfall during the five years 1930-1934 was 36.11 inches.

Means of Communication.

There is a mail, passenger, and freight service between New York and Grand Turk about twice a month by steamers of the Royal Netherlands West India Mail, and also between Jamaica and Turks Islands once a month by sailing vessel.

The Elders and Fyffes Line make occasional calls on their way to Jamaica when passengers offer and on such occasions take mails to Jamaica.

The rate of letter postage is 2d. per ounce to all British Possessions; 2½d. to the U.S.A., and to all other countries 3d. per ounce.

There are no railways in these Islands.

Internal mails are carried between the several islands by small sailing craft engaged in local trade.

Mails to and from England and other parts of the world are dispatched and received via New York.

Grand Turk is an important cable junction, there being cables to Jamaica, to Barbados and to Bermuda.

The Government radio-telegraph system provides service between Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour, and Salt Cay, and with ships at sea within short range.

There is a public telephone service at Grand Turk.

Education.

There are eleven elementary schools supported by Government, with 824 pupils enrolled in 1934 and an average attendance of 560. The schools are entirely unsectarian and free.

There is a Government Secondary School at Grand Turk.

Cambridge Local Examinations are held annually at Grand Turk.
