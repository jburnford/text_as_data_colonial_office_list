FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,700 miles, and from Auckland 1,100 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, and reefs between 12° and 16° S., and between 175° and 180° E.
The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,063 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,180 square miles, Taveuni, 217 square miles, Kandavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Ngau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,083 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a maximum height of 4,300 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lowerlands are more lightly timbered, and were probably mostly under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Gold is being mined at Yanawai, near the south coast of Vanualevu Island, and at Tavua in the northern portion of Vitilevu Island, and active prospecting operations are in progress in both localities. At Yanawai the gold is associated with barytes, while at Tavua it occurs in altered andesites. 6,933 ounces of gold bullion were exported from the Colony during 1935. A very small percentage of silver is found to be associated with the gold in all bullion exported. Copper ore carrying low gold values occurs in the Sambeto valley in the western portion of Vitilevu, but such deposits have not so far been proved to be payable.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Singatoka, the Nandi, and Mba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Ndreketi river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "ndalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofua and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1891. The population was found at the census of 1921 to number 2,402, of whom two-thirds are Methodists, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra.

The natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity. A European Resident Commissioner is the chief executive authority. He also presides over the Rotuma Court of Justice, styled "The Commissioner's Court." The Commissioner's judicial powers are similar to those of a Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Fiji and a District Commissioner of the Colony, but special provision is made for the hearing of indictable cases in Rotuma. There are also two Native Stipendiary Magistrates.

The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which is a chief appointed by the Governor, and is administered by the Resident Commissioner with the assistance of a Council of Chiefs, held monthly. The Council, an advisory body, consists of the Resident Commissioner (Chairman), the seven District Chiefs, two Native Stipendiary Magistrates, the Native Medical Practitioner, and one representative from each district.

A Rotuma Regulation Board consisting of the Resident Commissioner, and between five and ten native Rotumans, makes regulations relating to the good government and well-being of the natives. All such regulations are subject to approval by the Legislative Council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. A census was taken on the 26th April, 1936, and the population of the Colony was:

| Europeans | Half Castes | Fijians | Rotumans | Indians | Polynesians | Melanesians | Micronesians | Chinese | Others |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|------------|------------|-------------|--------|-------|
|           |             |        |          |        |            |            |             |        |       |

Total 198,379

The births among the native population in 1935 totalled 3,652, and the deaths 2,178. The birth rate was 36·53, and the death rate 21·79 per mil. The Methodist and Roman Catholic missions gave the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1935:

| Methodist | Roman Catholic |

History.

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the Bounty, sighted part of the group in 1789,
and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1869 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These Commissioners, in 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in 1874 to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the Chief of Mbau, Maafu, who was Chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taveuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate Colony, and providing for their government.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva is estimated at 1,900.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Malarial fevers have never been met with.

The highest temperature at Suva in 1935 was 94 degrees on Feb. 15th, and the lowest 63 degrees on September 22nd. The total rainfall was 163-62. The average annual rainfall is 119-55 inches. There is a great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to October is usually the driest period. Between November and April, the wet season, hurricanes and cyclonic storms occasionally occur, December to March being the months of greatest frequency.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 9th February, 1929. The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, the Secretary for Indian Affairs, and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

Native Affairs.

The Legislative Council at present consists of the Governor and not more than thirteen nominated official members, six European elected members, three native nominated members, and three Indian elected members. The revision of the constitution of the Council is, however, at present under consideration.

The natives retain a large share of self-government. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by a triennial meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. There is a Native Regulation Board, constituted under "The Native Affairs Ordinance, 1876," which has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage and divorce of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council.

Shipping.

Suva and Levuka are ports of Registry under the Merchant Shipping Act. On the 31st December, 1935, there were on the Register 4 steam vessels of a tonnage of 5,387 tons, and 11 motor vessels of a tonnage of 960 tons.

The number of local vessels trading within the Colony and holding Sea-going Certificates from the Marine Board during 1935 was:

| Owned by: | No. | Tons |
|-----------|-----|------|
| Europeans | 37  | 1,311|
| Natives   | 15  | 268  |
| Others    | 15  | 241  |

Total: 67, 1,810

The number of merchant vessels entered from overseas at the three ports of entry in the Colony during the year 1935 was 161, the total registered tonnage being 865,316; of these vessels 107 were British, tonnage 477,776; 32 American, 310,728 tons; 2 Danish, 8,647 tons; 8 Swedish, 34,779 tons; 5 Panamanian, 9,755 tons; 4 French, 18,091 tons; 2 Norwegian, 5,512 tons; and 1 Polish, 28 tons.

Local Government.

On the 1st January, 1936, the Municipal Council of Suva was replaced by the Suva Town Board consisting of seven official members (one presiding), two European unofficial members, two Fijian unofficial members and two Indian unofficial members; all nominated by the Governor.

Levuka, the old capital of Fiji, is controlled by a Township Board of which the District Commissioner is Chairman and the District Medical Officer, the Inspector of Constabulary, the District Engineer, Suva, the Headmaster, Levuka Provincial School and five others are members.

Education.

The Education Ordinance No. 1 of 1929 constituted the Department of Education and established the Board of Education. The Board consists of the Director of Education and eight other members nominated by the Governor. The Ordinance gives very wide powers to the Board to control all phases of education. The most important are the registering of schools and teachers, the allocating of grants-in-aid, the determining of the instruction to be given and to advise the Governor on establishing of education districts. Only two such districts, Suva and Levuka, have been established.
The Education Rating Ordinance No. 18 of 1934 authorises the levying of a special rate in these two districts to meet one-half the net cost incurred by the Government in maintaining Government schools within the limits of the districts.

There are two Grammar Schools for Europeans in Suva, one for boys and one for girls, with hostels attached, and a public school in Levuka, all under Government control. The roll number during 1935 at the Boys' Grammar School, Suva, was 146; at the Girls' Grammar School, Suva (where boys under 8 are taken), 219. The roll in 1935 for the Levuka Public School was 136 (boys and girls).

The Queen Victoria Memorial School at Nasinu, near Suva, is intended to provide for the higher education of natives, and is maintained from public revenue. The number of boys on the roll during 1935 was 87.

Schools for the primary education of Fijians may be conducted by the Methodist, Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Seventh Day Adventist Missions, by the Provincial Councils, by any other properly constituted authority or by the Government. Six Provincial schools have been established by the Government at Lau, Taveuni, Londoni, Kandavu, Nandi, and Sawani, in charge of European Headmasters.

At the end of 1935 there were 211 Government and Assisted Schools, 125 for Fijians, Rotumans, etc., 62 for Indians, 9 receiving both Fijians and Indians, 13 for Europeans and half-castes, one for Chinese and one for Melanesians.

They had 16,694 pupils, of whom there were 10,066 Fijians, Rotumans and Melanesians, 5,269 Indians, 1,275 Europeans and half-castes and 94 Chinese.

In addition returns were received from 122 recognised schools with 5,480 pupils—5,115 Fijians, Rotumans, etc., 230 Indians, 95 Europeans and half-castes.

There were 477 registered and 754 recognised teachers in the Colony at the end of 1935.

The estimated expenditure on education for 1936 is £47,837.

Currency and Banking.

Legislation in 1933 and 1934 provided for the issue of Government currency notes and coin which follow the United Kingdom currency denominations.

The Fiji pound is linked to sterling by law at the fixed rate of £F111 = £100 sterling.

The circulation at 31st December, 1935, was:

| Notes | £506,866 |
| Coin | £59,890 |

£566,756

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva, Levuka and Lautoka; the Bank of New Zealand has a branch at Suva.

Under Ordinance I., of 1907, a Government Savings Bank was opened in 1908. At the end of 1935 there were 8,517 depositors and £269,985 in deposits.

Industries, Trade, and Customs.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas. Considerable progress is being made in gold mining and it is expected this will become one of the principal industries in the Colony.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize; but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 34 tons were exported. The cotton industry is again receiving attention. As a result of the Ottawa Conference, Australia now admits 40,000 centsals of bananas per year, with a preferential duty of 2/6 per cental. High costs in Australia still provide a barrier to trade and the shipments are much below the authorised quantity. Previously, owing to the imposition by the Commonwealth Government, in 1921, of a prohibitive duty on imported bananas, the export of this fruit was entirely confined to the New Zealand Market. A number of trial shipments of bananas to Canada were made in 1934, and in 1935, 15,767 bunches, valued at £3,988, were shipped to that market.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of Bananas, Pineapples, and citrus fruits. Exports, the produce of the Colony, increased in value from £341,678l. in 1934 to £725,220l. in 1935. In 1935 exports of Sugar, Copra, and fruit were:—Sugar, 135,633 tons, value £1,314,128l.; Copra, 26,081 tons, value £220,478l.; Bananas, 303,127 bunches, value £68,863l.; Fresh Pines, 986 cases, value £371l.

The other principal exports in 1935 consisted of:—Beche-de-mer, 434 cwt., value £2,381l.; Biscuits, 71,394 lbs., value £1,438l.; Canned Pines, 114,794 lbs., value £1,781l.; Gum, 3,657 cwt., value £4,196l.; Hides, 4,506 hides, value £2,867l.; Molasses, 16,545 tons, value £16,545l.; Shell Trochas, 298 tons, value £20,226l.; Soap plain, 3,311 cwt., value £4,235l.; Vegetables, fresh, 5,881 cwt., value £2,271l.; Gold Bullion, 6,933 ozs., value £4,019l.

The rice crop was insufficient for local demands and it was found necessary to import 1,201 tons during 1935.

Dairying is an established industry.

Many parts of the Colony seem admirably adapted for cattle and sheep raising.

A soap factory has been established in Suva which supplies a considerable proportion of the local requirements for laundry soaps and exported 3,311 cwt. during 1935.

The Customs Tariff is, in general, on an ad valorem basis, duty being assessed on the value of goods at the Port of Shipment. Practically all products of the British Empire receive preferential treatment, provided that British Empire material and labour represent not less than 25 per cent. of the value of the goods, and that the final processes of manufacture are performed within the Empire.

The total trade of the Colony in 1935 was £3,067,898l.

The total trade was divided as follows:

| Imports % | Exports % |
|-----------|-----------|
| United Kingdom | 39·45 | 49·54 |
| Other British Possessions | 42·33 | 39·26 |
| Foreign Countries | 16·26 | 10·23 |
| Parcels Post | 1·96 | — |
| Ships Stores | — | 97 |
