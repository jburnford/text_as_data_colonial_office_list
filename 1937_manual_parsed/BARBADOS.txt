BARBADOS.*

Situation and Area.
Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, somewhat larger than the Isle of Wight.

History.
The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who found it uninhabited and rude in appearance, and named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig-trees. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship Olive Blossom in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1626 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I., fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed in February, 1627, on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their Governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I. of all the Caribbean Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300l. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as Governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The Leeward and Windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without

success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

General Description.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, in latitude 13° 5' 42" North, and longitude 3° 38' 29" West. This town contains, according to the census of 1921, 13,486 inhabitants. Speightstown, the only other town, has about 1,500 inhabitants.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or careenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. It is a port of registry, and had registered, on 31st December, 1935, 72 vessels, of a total net tonnage of 12,965 tons.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as off the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation.

The area of the island called the Scotland district, which is the part enclosed by a semi-circular sweep of the ridge in the north-east, is composed of sandstones, clays, and insular earths.

Traces of oil were discovered in certain districts and experimental borings were carried out by the British Union Oil Company, Ltd., but the flow of oil was inadequate and operations on a large scale have ceased.

The Company has also established an oil depot and bunkering station for ships in Carlisle Bay.

A water supply is provided for all the parishes of the island by the Colonial Government, which bought up and extended the water works formerly operated by two companies, the Bridgetown Water Works Company and the Barbados Water Supply Company.

Owing to the steady Easterly Trade winds, which blow almost continuously from December to June, the climate is bracing and the heat is never oppressive. During the remainder of the year, the wet season of the Island, the heat is seldom excessive, although the absence of the Trade Winds renders the climate less invigorating. The average temperature is 79.8° and rainfall 61 inches.

The Island is largely visited as a Health resort by residents of neighbouring West Indian Colonies and British Guiana. It is, to a considerable extent, also utilised as a winter resort by visitors from temperate climates and a port of call for tourist steamers.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. The produce exported during the last three years has been as follows:

| Year | Sugar | Molasses |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1933 | 78,994 | 9,003,274 |
| 1934 | 87,459 | 11,621,180 |
| 1935 | 39,392 | 10,785,568 |

The area under sugar cultivation is estimated at 35,600 acres. In September, 1898, the island, in common with St. Lucia and St. Vincent, suffered severely from the effects of a disastrous hurricane. In 1902-3 there was an epidemic of small-pox, which caused a prolonged quarantine and seriously affected trade. Cotton-growing was revived with help from the Colonial Treasury and the British Cotton Growing Association, but owing to market and other conditions almost entirely ceased. In 1935 the amount of cotton exported was 41,277 lbs., valued at 2,775£. Efforts to revive the industry have been partially successful.

The distribution of the Colony's import trade in 1935 was:

| Country                  | %   | Value     |
|--------------------------|-----|-----------|
| United Kingdom           | 40.9| £752,831  |
| Canada                   | 14.1| £258,520  |
| Other parts of the British Empire | 18.9| £348,029  |
| United States of America | 11.7| £215,160  |
| Other Foreign Countries  | 14.4| £265,017  |

The Imports are classified as follows:

| Category               | Value     |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Food, drink, etc.      | £697,210  |
| Raw materials          | £204,031  |
| Manufactured articles  | £889,203  |
| Animals not for Food   | £8,183    |
| Miscellaneous          | £42,147   |

Total: £1,840,783

The Customs Tariff of the Colony is the result of the Canada West Indies Reciprocal (Tariff) Agreement Act, 1926, which provides that the duties on all goods the produce or manufacture of Canada shall not be more than 50 per cent of the duties on similar goods imported from Foreign countries. Exceptions to this provision are Tobacco, Cigars and Cigarettes while specific preferences are provided for on a list of Articles named in Schedule B of the Act.

These preferences were by the Customs Tariff Act, 1921, extended to goods the produce or manufacture of all parts of the British Empire.

Twenty-five per cent., 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of British factory cost of articles, partly of foreign origin, entitles these goods to be admitted under the British Preferential Tariff, except piece goods, containing 50 per cent. or more by weight of cotton or of artificial silk or of cotton and artificial silk combined imported from the United Kingdom, which may not be admitted under the British Preferential Tariff unless they have been spun, woven and finished in the British Empire. Under the Quotas Act, 1934, all importations of this class of piece goods from any foreign country are restricted.

As a result of the Conference held at Ottawa in 1932 further preferences were granted to Empire goods and given effect to by the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Act 1932 No. 2.

About two-thirds of the duties are on a specific and the remainder on an ad valorem basis.

Population.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939. By the census of 1891 the population was returned at 182,306. By the census of April, 1921, the population was 156,312, the decrease, as compared with the figures for 1891, being attributed to the large numbers of the labouring classes which have from time to time emigrated to Panama in connection with the Canal Works, while many others have gone to Para, Brazil, Cuba, the United States of America and Canada in search of more remunerative employment than what can be obtained locally. The estimated

population at the end of 1935 was 184,912. English is universally spoken. Labour is cheap, and the soil is well cultivated, the island having the appearance of a well-kept garden.

Currency and Banking.

Government accounts are kept in sterling; commercial accounts in dollars. British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, and there is no gold in circulation. There are three banks doing business in Barbados, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), capital paid up £4,975,500 sterling, and the Royal Bank of Canada, with a paid up capital of £7,291,666, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce with a paid up capital of £6,250,000. There is a Government savings bank, which had, on 31st December, 1935, 13,578 depositors. The total amount at credit of depositors on 31st December, 1935, was £744,886.

Internal Communication.

A railway from Bridgetown to the parish of St. Andrew (24 miles as surveyed) was commenced in 1880, and completed in September, 1882.

In 1916 the Railway was bought by the Government from the Company which operated it for the sum of £20,000, the cost of construction in 1882 being £15,284, and considerable sums having been spent on reconstruction between 1898 and 1904.

An elaborate road system exists throughout the Island, 538 miles of road being suitable for use by motor vehicles.

The Barbados Telephone Co., Limited, a private company, maintains a total of 2,374 services, with a total length of line in use of about 6,500 miles. There is also a railway telephone line connecting all stations from Bridgetown to St. Andrews, about 24 miles.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act No. 41 of the 9th December, 1878, which authorised a total expenditure not exceeding 15,000£ annually on all grades of education. This section of the Act of 1878 was repealed, and Section 9 (d) of the Education (Amendment) Act, 1897, authorised an annual expenditure of a sum not exceeding 11,000£ on elementary education. This section has now been repealed by the Education (Amendment) Act, 1910, which authorised the amount to be spent on elementary education at 14,200£. In 1936 the sum of 46,211£ was voted by the Legislature for Elementary Education, and the total vote for all grades of education amounted to 59,706£.

The central administration is vested in a Board appointed by the Governor, and the local control of elementary schools is in the hands of the clergymen of the various districts assisted by committees of management. There are 126 elementary schools with 18,220 scholars (average attendance), and 25,497 on the rolls. At these elementary schools free education is now provided. Secondary schools are managed by Governing Bodies working under schemes formulated by the central Board of Education and approved by the Legislature.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Sir Christopher Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30£ per annum from the College funds, and six Island Scholarships at 40£ per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are competitive, and are confined to natives or sons of natives, or of persons domiciled in the island who have resided therein for at least ten years.

There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation, which has been liberally supported by the Legislature. It has a staff of twelve university men as Masters, two Preparatory Mistresses, two Lecturers in Natural and Agricultural Sciences and two additional masters in the Lower Forms. The number of pupils at the close of 1935 was 269. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish, to the N.E. of the island, was re-opened in 1882, after having been closed for several years. The number of pupils at the close of 1935 was 126. The Barbados English Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, are tenable at any College in the British Empire approved by the Board, for a period of four years.

The number of years for which these scholarships are tenable may be varied to five or six, but the total value of each scholarship cannot be more than 1,050£, with an additional 50£ to defray initial expenses.

A first-grade school for girls was opened in 1883, called the Queen's College. It has a staff of eleven teachers. The number of pupils at the close of 1935 was 159.

There are five second-grade schools for boys and three for girls. These first and second-grade schools cost the Government, including grants for scholarships, 10,200£ during 1935. They also receive annual grants for scholarships from the Vestries of the various parishes in which they are situated.

Police, &c.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1836 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. The Force consists of 4 officers and 466 non-commissioned officers and men. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1867) were combined with the Land Police. A Juvenile Reformatory for boys was opened in April, 1883, and one for girls in April, 1911.

There is a lunatic asylum, a lazaretto and a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the latter of which the Colony contributed 20,000£ in 1935-36.

Constitution.

The Colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the appointment and control of public officers, except the Treasurer, who is an officer of the House of Assembly. The Legislature consists of a Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of nine members appointed by the King, and a House of Assembly, having twenty-four members elected annually on the basis of a moderate franchise. The qualifications of members and electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, which became law in April, 1884, and which repeals all previous legislation on the subject. By this Act an extension of the franchise was granted, and 2,004 electors were registered under its provisions, the number previous to its enactment being only 1,641. This and other Acts relating to the franchise was consolidated by the Representation of the People Act, 1901. The only change made was the extension of the franchise to persons enjoying a pension of 60£ a year or more. The number of registered electors for the year 1935 was 5,564. The executive part of the Government is vested in the Executive Council appointed by the Crown and consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General ex officio, Sir F. J. Clarke, K.C.M.G., and Sir J. R. Phillips, Kt., O.B.E., and such other persons as may be nominated by the King, and the Executive Committee consists of the members of the Executive Council ex officio, one member from the Legislative Council, and four members of the House of Assembly nominated annually by the Governor. This body introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates, and initiates all Government measures. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Tobago, but in 1885, by Royal Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands and made a distinct Government.

Local Government.

The island is divided into eleven parishes, each of which has its local affairs administered by a Vestry which is elected annually, the Rector of the Parish being the Chairman. The functions of the Vestry include sanitation, the care of the sick and poor, and the upkeep of roads. The latter is carried out by Highway Commissioners appointed by each Vestry from its members. The Vestries levy rates on lands and houses, and taxes on trade vehicles, draught animals, etc.

The total revenue collected by the Vestries in 1935-36 amounted to 119,222£.
