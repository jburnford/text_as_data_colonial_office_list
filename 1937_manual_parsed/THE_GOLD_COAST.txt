THE GOLD COAST.
THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast Colony, with Ashanti, the Northern Territories, and Togoland under British Mandate, is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, between 3° 15' W. long. and 1° 12' E. long., and is bounded on the west by the French colony of the Ivory Coast, on the east by Togoland under French Mandate, on the north by the French Soudan, and on the south by the Atlantic Ocean.

The area of the Colony is 23,937 square miles, of Ashanti, 24,379, of the Northern Territories, 30,486, and of Togoland under British Mandate, 13,041.

The Colony is inhabited by a large number of tribes, whose customs and forms of government are of a more or less similar character. Each tribe has its own head chief and every town or village of the tribe a chief or headman.

The head chiefs and chiefs form the council of the tribe, and assist in dealing with matters affecting its general welfare. The succession to the chiefs' stools is for the most part in the female line, the heir to the stool being selected from among the sons of the occupant's sisters, his brothers and the male offspring of his uncles on the mother's side.

The principal sea coast states are the following:—Nzima, Ahanta, Sekondi, Komenda, Edina, Oguas, Winneba, Assin Gomoa, Ga, Adangme, Awuma and Agbosome.

In the interior of the Colony the principal states are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wasaw, Sefwi, upper and lower Denkera, Tufel, Assen, Esikuma, Ajumako, Birim Akim Abuakwa and Birim Kwahu, Akim Kotoku, Akwapim, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepi, Shai and Ningo.

A number of different languages and dialects are spoken, the principal being, Twi, Fanti, Ewe and Ga; but the use of English is widespread.

For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into three provinces, each presided over by a Provincial Commissioner. These Provinces are further divided into districts, presided over by District Commissioners. Most of these Officers perform judicial duties as magistrates in addition to being in administrative charge of their districts.

The districts are as follows:—

1. Western province:—Districts—Axim, Ankobra, Tarkwa, Sekondi-Dixcove, Sefwi and Aowin.
2. Central province:—Districts—Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winneba, Western Akim.
3. Eastern province:—Districts—Acora, New Juaben, Akwapim, Volta River, Keta-Ada, Birim Akim-Abuakwa and Birim Kwahu, Ho (Togoland).

History.

Little is known of the history of the people of the Gold Coast prior to the first recorded contact with Europeans, which took place towards the end of the 16th century, but tradition, borne out by the present language distribution and by the absence of traces of large earlier settlements, is that the present population resulted from a series of waves of immigration in comparatively recent historical times.

Of these immigrants the most numerous were the Akans who, displaced by more warlike and better organised tribes, came from the north-west in search of sanctuary to the forests of the Gold Coast, some sections of them eventually reaching the sea. Their numbers being augmented by a succession of later waves, the Akans assimilated the aborigines and gradually occupied the greater part of the country. Behind the Akans came the Moshi who, partly by conquest and partly by peaceful penetration, obtained supremacy over the inhabitants of the northern portion of the Gold Coast and established the Mamprussi and Dagomba kingdoms under the rule of sons or other relatives of their leaders. At a later date the south-east corner of the Colony was peopled by an infiltration of Ga, Adangbe and Ewe tribes from the east and north-east.

The first Europeans to reach the Gold Coast were the Portuguese who, arriving in 1471, built the Castle at Elmina eleven years later in order to protect their trading interests. They found a people of hunters and fishermen, primitive in habits and development, yet understanding the working of iron and fully conscious of the value of gold. No native state of any size had yet been established, but numerous petty chiefdoms were in existence.

Until the close of the 16th century the Portuguese maintained their trading monopoly. Feeble efforts on the part of other European Powers, including the
English, were made to obtain a footing on the Coast, but the Portuguese were never seriously challenged until the advent of the Dutch in 1595.

At first the Portuguese were interested in obtaining gold, ivory and spices, but with the opening up of the New World there came a demand for cheap labour for the plantations. So commenced the transatlantic slave trade which, until its decline and abolition in the 19th century, shaped the history of the Gold Coast.

The main results of the slave trade were two-fold. First, in order to feed the slaves awaiting shipment and their captors, the Portuguese were obliged to introduce food plants and to teach an improved method of agriculture to a people hitherto largely dependent for food on the natural resources of the forest and sea. Secondly, the lucrative nature of the trade attracted the attention of other European nations besides the Portuguese to the possibilities of the Gold Coast.

The Dutch, appearing on the Coast in 1595, rapidly undermined the domination of the Portuguese. In 1637 they captured Elmina and in 1642 the Portuguese abandoned all their possessions in the Gold Coast to the newcomers. Other European Powers, including the English, followed and, fighting amongst themselves, scrambled for a footing on the Coast. By 1750, however, the year in which the African Company of Merchants was formed and subsidised by the British Government to the extent of £13,000 per annum, all had withdrawn except the Dutch with their headquarters at Elmina, the Danes with their headquarters at Christiansborg and the English with their headquarters at Cape Coast Castle.

In 1821 the British Government first assumed the control of the British settlements in the Gold Coast, and the African Company of Merchants was dissolved, its possessions being vested in the Crown and placed under the Government of Sierra Leone. Seven years later, however, the British Government, after considering complete withdrawal from the Coast, entrusted the government of the settlements in the Gold Coast to a Committee of London Merchants. In 1843, however, the 1821 arrangement was restored in consequence of suspected slave trading, which had been abolished by Great Britain in 1833. The year 1850 saw the separation of the British forts and settlements of the Gold Coast from Sierra Leone, the cession of the Danish possessions to Britain and the creation by Letters Patent of Executive and Legislative Councils, but in 1866 government from Sierra Leone was resumed.

In 1872 the Dutch withdrew from the Gold Coast, handing over their possessions to the British. Two years later, after Sir Garnet Wolseley's successful Ashanti campaign, came the final separation from Sierra Leone, measures being taken on the conclusion of peace for placing the government of the Gold Coast on a footing of efficiency and security. A new Charter was issued dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating Her Majesty's Settlements on the Gold Coast and Lagos from the Government of Sierra Leone and constituting them into one Colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony under a Governor-in-Chief with an Administrator at Lagos.

In 1886 all the settlements and territories belonging to Her Majesty on the Gold Coast were, by Letters Patent dated the 13th January, formed into a distinct Colony, Lagos being separated therefrom. This territory, however, did not include all the areas under British protection and had no specified boundaries. To regularise the position, therefore, these protected areas were annexed to His Majesty's Dominions and declared to be part and parcel of His Majesty's Gold Coast Colony by Order-in-Council of the 26th September, 1901. The boundaries of the Colony thus constituted were defined by Order-in-Council dated the 22nd October, 1906, and have since remained unchanged.

**Constitution.**

The constitutional instruments providing for the Government of the Colony are the Letters Patent and Royal Instructions dated the 23rd of May, 1925, the former of which create the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and constitute an Executive Council consisting of such persons as shall be directed by Instructions under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet, and a Legislative Council constituted in such manner and consisting of the Governor and such persons as are directed by the Order in Council of the 8th of April, 1925, and known as the Gold Coast Colony (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1925. Royal Instructions were also passed on the 23rd May, 1925, directing that the Executive Council should consist of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Director of Medical Services, and the Secretary of Native Affairs (these to be styled ex-officio Members) and such other persons as were at the date of the coming into operation of the aforesaid Letters Patent Members of the Council or as may be appointed under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet or as the Governor may appoint in pursuance of Instructions through a Secretary of State. The Legislative Council contains an elective element and consists of the Governor as President together with fifteen Official Members and fourteen Unofficial Members. The Official Members are the five senior Members of the Executive Council, the Comptroller of Customs, the Director of Public Works, the General Manager of the Railway, the Commissioners of the Eastern, Central and Western Provinces, as ex-officio Members, and such other officials not exceeding two at any one time as the Governor may appoint. The Unofficial Members are six Provincial Members, namely three for the Eastern Province, two for the Central Province, and one for the Western Province; three Municipal Members, namely, one each for the towns of Accra, Cape Coast and Sekondi respectively; one European Mercantile Member, one European Mining Member and three Europeans nominated by the Governor. The Provincial Members are Head Chiefs elected by the Provincial Councils of the said Provinces; the Municipal Members are elected by the electorate of the said towns; the Mercantile Member is elected by the Chambers of Commerce; and the Mining Member is elected by the Chamber of Mines.

**Municipal Government.**

The Town Councils Ordinance has been extended to the towns of Accra, Sekondi and Cape Coast. The town of Kumasi in Ashanti is under the control of a statutory corporation styled the Kumasi Public Health Board.

**Law and Justice.**

The Law of the Colony is the Common Law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application in force in England, on the 24th July, 1874, modified by a large number of Local Ordinances passed since that date. The Criminal Law was codified in 1892, and the civil and criminal procedure are regulated by the Courts Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code, both enacted in 1935.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court which is presided over by the Chief Justice and seven Puisne Judges. Divisional Courts of the Supreme Court are held in different parts of the colony. There are also a large number of inferior Courts with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction, some of which are presided over by District Magistrates and District and Provincial Commissioners. The
Supreme Court has an original civil and criminal jurisdiction, and also decides appeals from the inferior courts. Appeals from the Divisional Courts and from the Courts of the Provincial Commissioners in land cases lie to the West African Court of Appeal.

Native customary law is administered in all the Courts, in so far as it is not incompatible either directly or by necessary implication with any Ordinance for the time being in force, and not repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience.

Native Tribunals, presided over by Paramount or Divisional Chiefs, are established throughout the Colony, with criminal and civil jurisdiction in cases where the parties are subject thereto. Such jurisdiction has been much increased by recent legislation, and certain judicial powers have also been conferred upon State Councils and Provincial Councils.

There is an appeal from the Tribunal of a Divisional Chief to that of a Paramount Chief, and from a Paramount Chief's Tribunal to the District Commissioner's Court; but, where a title to land is in dispute, the appeal lies from the Paramount Chief's Tribunal to the Provincial Commissioner's Court.

**Prisons.**

There are four central and 20 local prisons.

The central prisons are at Accra, Sekondi, Kumasi and Tamale.

The following industries are carried on successfully: Carpentry, cabinet-making, tailoring, mat and basket making, boot and shoe making, weaving, farming, string and rope making, brick-making, brush and broom making.

The Mark System, whereby the remission of one quarter of a sentence can be earned by hard work and good conduct, is applied to all persons sentenced to two years or more.

A modified mark system was introduced during 1935, whereby prisoners with sentences of over 6 months and under two years can earn a remission of one-sixth of their sentence.

A Boys' Industrial Home under the control of the Salvation Army has been established at Kintampo.

**Climate.**

The climate although hot and damp, is cooler than that of most tropical countries situated in similar latitudes. The most adverse feature relative to the residence of Europeans is the very high relative humidity which only falls below 80° in the dry districts of the north and east and during the Harmattan. The average mean temperature is from 77°—82°, being greatest in the north and east and lowest in the forest area. Extremes of shade temperature have been 105° in Tamale and 50° at Kumasi.

The rainfall varies with the configuration of the country, being greatest in the south-western corner around Axim and least in the far north and coastal belt. There is the double wet season common to Tropical Africa corresponding to the double passage of the sun, the major rains in the south being in May and June and the lesser rains in September and October. In the Northern Territories intensity of the rains is reversed and in the extreme north the passages of the sun are so near to one another in date that there is only one wet season.

The most pronounced season is the Harmattan characterised by a dry north-east wind which blows from the Sahara carrying clouds of red dust during the period of cessation of the south-west monsoon. This occurs at the period when the sun is passing southwards to the spring solstice during January and February, and the feature is the terrific desiccation of the atmosphere. A drop of 63 per cent. of relative humidity has been experienced in 24 hours with a result that papers and books curl up and the skin appears parched and dry. The daily range of temperature is more than doubled and the period is very trying to Europeans. For the year 1935, the rainfall and the average figures for maximum shade temperature, mean daily temperature and mean R.H. at 9.0 a.m. are given in the table below:

| Location | Rainfall inches | Max. Shade °F | Mean Temp. °F | Mean R.H. at 9 a.m. |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Accra    | 28-32          | 84-2          | 79-9          | 79-2              |
| Sekondi  | 45-58          | 89-8          | 82-2          | 72-5              |
| Kumasi   | 65-12          | 88-6          | 78-9          | 84-4              |
| Tamale   | 48-67          | 93-3          | 80-6          | 67-1              |

**Mail and Steamship Services.**

Elder Dempster Lines Limited are under contract with the Postmaster-General for conveyance of His Majesty's mails between Liverpool and the West and South-West coasts of Africa.

Regular sailings are maintained between Liverpool and West African ports for mails, passengers and cargo. There are also regular sailings from London.

A mail steamer of this Company leaves Liverpool for Calabar and Port Harcourt alternately once a fortnight. The Port Harcourt service calls at Madeira, Las Palmas, Bathurst, Freetown, Takoradi, Accra, Lagos and Port Harcourt. The Calabar service calls at Madeira, Freetown, Monrovia, Takoradi, Accra, Lagos, Suellaba, Calabar and Victoria; the usual length of voyage being thirteen days to Gold Coast ports.

Cargo vessels are despatched from Liverpool once every three weeks, calling at the principal Gold Coast ports, length of voyage about 21 days.

At present, cargo steamers are despatched from New York every six weeks and call at the principal Gold Coast ports both outwards and homewards, the average length of voyage being 28 days.

Cargo vessels are despatched from Hamburg every 17 days, calling at Rotterdam, Antwerp and London for the principal Gold Coast ports. Average length of voyage from Hamburg to the first port of Call on the Gold Coast is 21 days.

Harbours.

The Gold Coast was for many years at a great disadvantage in that it possessed no deep-water harbour. Jetties protected by breakwaters were built at Sekondi and Accra, for the use of surf boats and lighters.

Sekondi has been replaced by a deep-water harbour a few miles to the westward at Takoradi which was opened to shipping in 1928. The harbour is 220 acres in extent and provides moorings for six ocean-going ships whilst three can be berthed alongside the main wharf, which contains a large manganese-loading transporter. There is a fourth berth for local coal traffic.

Internal Communications.

Railway communication consists of a main line running from Takoradi to Kumasi, thence to Accra, a distance of 366 miles, with branches, Sekondi to Takoradi Junction (3 miles), Tarkwa to Prestea (18 miles), Aboso to Cinnamon Bippo (4 miles), and Huni Valley to Kade (98 miles). The Main Line and Branches are 3' 6" gauge. There is a branch line, Accra to Weija (Accra Water Works), 10 miles in length which is 2' 6" gauge.

The railway gross earnings for the year 1935–36 were £1,000,336 and the working expenditure, including provision of £124,375 for renewals, and also pensions, was £548,641. (Transport Section excluded). The total number of miles open for traffic on the 31st March, 1936 was 500, and the capital cost 9,247,333L

The mileage of all weather motor roads, exclusive of town roads, maintained by the Public Works Department is 2,165 miles as follows:

| Tarred or Bitumen Surface | Gravel | Total |
|---------------------------|--------|-------|
| Miles | Miles | Miles |
| Accra District | 44½ | 144½ | 189 |
| Nsawam District | 42½ | 56½ | 99 |
| Koforidua District | 65½ | 104 | 169½ |
| Keta District | 6 | 1 | 7 |
| Winneba District | 74½ | 195½ | 270½ |
| Cape Coast District | 75 | 116½ | 191½ |
| Takoradi District | 19½ | 129 | 148½ |
| Dunkwa District | — | 257½ | 257½ |
| Ashanti | 152½ | 332½ | 485 |
| Northern Territories | — | 347½ | 347½ |

In addition to the mileage maintained by the Public Works Department, there are some 2,700 miles of dry season road maintained by the Political Administration with funds provided by Government. The Chiefs also maintain a considerable mileage of earth roads.

These roads are all motorable in the dry season and have opened up the country in all directions to motor traffic. Ferries have been installed and bridges built wherever necessary.
The Black Volta rises in the hills near Soukouraba, and the White Volta rises near Quahigouga, both in the French province of Haute Volta. These two rivers converge some 280 miles from the sea on the Ashanti-Northern Territories border and become the River Volta which flows into the sea at Ada. This river is navigable for light draught launches as far as Akuse, and, with the exception of the Krachi rapids, can be used for canoe traffic during certain seasons of the year as far as Yeji. The Ankobra River is navigable for many months of the year by surf-boats and light draught launches for a distance of 50 miles. The Tano, connected with Half Assini, by the main lagoon, and by a tramway, three miles in length, is navigable for light draught launches and canoes as far as Tanoso, a distance of about 60 miles.

Rapids at Sutri prevent this river being further utilised.

The ferry over the River Volta at Senkye is capable of taking the largest cars and lorries, and is now worked by an endless chain driven by a petrol motor placed on the ferry boat. A similar ferry is in operation over the same river at Yeji.

The Government maintains a Motor Transport Service, which operates in centres where vehicles provided by private enterprise are unobtainable or more costly than a Government-owned fleet. The headquarters is at Accra, with branches at Kumasi and Tamale. The department also handles Government cargo and officials' baggage and stores arriving by sea and arranges the coastwise shipping of Government personnel and stores between ports within the Colony.

In addition to their departmental duties, the officers of the Transport Department assist in carrying out the provisions of the Motor Traffic Ordinance by acting as Testing and Certifying Officers.

Medical Facilities.

Medical Officers are stationed at all the principal centres of the Colony and its dependencies. Many of these officers travel in their districts and give treatment in village dispensaries.

There are seven European hospitals in the Gold Coast; five in the Colony, one in Ashanti and one in the Northern Territories.

There are also thirty-two African hospitals; twenty in the Colony, six in the Northern Territories, four in Ashanti and two in the British Sphere of Togoland.

The Gold Coast Hospital was opened at Accra in October, 1923, and does excellent work. It continues to grow in popularity with the African community. It contains 228 beds and eighteen cots, which are nearly always occupied.

In the year 1935 the hospital dealt with 17,983 out- and 3,140 in-patients, and 683 major operations were performed. At the African hospital, Kumasi, 12,660 out- and 2,758 in-patients were treated during the same period.

An up-to-date maternity hospital in charge of a woman medical officer, now containing forty-eight beds and twenty-nine cots, was opened in 1928 at Kawli Bu in the immediate vicinity of the Gold Coast Hospital and is highly appreciated. The training of midwives is carried on here. A new Red Cross ante-natal ward of 12 beds was opened in April, 1935.

In addition to the above there is a Laboratory Services Branch consisting of a central Medical Research Institute situated at Accra close to the Gold Coast Hospital. Valuable work in research, clinical pathology, etc., is carried on by this Branch.

Health.

The Health Branch of the Medical Department is controlled by a Deputy Director of Health Service who is responsible to the Director of Medical Services. Medical officers of health are stationed in five of the most important towns in the Colony and in Kumasi in Ashanti and Tamale in the Northern Territories. All Medical officers are charged with public health duties in their respective districts and in the more populous areas are assisted by European Sanitary Superintendents.

Public health activities are extended into rural areas as far as the available staff will allow. As close a watch as possible is kept on the smaller towns and villages along the main trade routes. Every encouragement is given to the people to lay-out their villages on open lines and improve the type of houses erected.

Particular stress is laid on the protection and improvement of village water supplies. Progress in rural sanitation which previously was marked, particularly in Ashanti, has in the last year or two suffered a severe set-back owing to considerations of financial stringency.

Birth and death registration is in force in thirty-five recognised registration areas, but cannot be applied yet to the Colony as a whole. For the year 1935 a birth rate of 33.0 and a crude death rate of 25.6 were returned. The infantile mortality rate is somewhat high; the rate for the registration areas for the year 1935 was 127. The maternal mortality figures for the year 1935 are still regrettably high, the return per 1,000 live births being 15.

Infant welfare and ante-natal welfare centres, in charge of women medical officers, have been established at Kumasi and Accra. At the Accra and Kumasi centre wards are attached.

At Cape Coast and Koforidua the centres are under the charge of European women medical officers of the Gold Coast Branch of the British Red Cross Society. The centre at Sekondi is controlled by an European Nursing Sister of the same society working under the medical officer of health.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails exchanged fortnightly between the Gold Coast and other British Colonies on the West Coast and the United Kingdom are carried by the steamers of the Elder Dempster Lines, Limited. Mails are exchanged overland with Togoland under French Mandate and with the French Ivory Coast; and direct mails from Hamburg are received fortnightly.

There are 72 Post Offices and 200 Postal Agencies, the distribution being effected principally by rail and motor. When this is impossible a runner service is employed. The rate for letters (1 oz.) within the Empire is 1d., to the United States of America 3d., elsewhere 3d.

There are 4,675 miles of Telegraph Line Wire serving all the principal centres. The rate is 1s. for 12 words, and 1d. per word in excess of 12.

There are 7,908 miles of telephone double wire, including overhead and underground cable circuits in use which link up 224 Exchanges and Call Offices throughout the country.

Any passenger or cargo boat entering Takoradi Harbour may be connected to the mainland telephone service and telegraph and phonogram system.

There are about 2,058 telephones, including those in Government Offices, in operation, and extensions to the system are in progress.

Parcel Post despatches are exchanged direct with the United Kingdom and with other British Colonies in West Africa, and the United States of America.
Parcels for other countries are forwarded through the United Kingdom. The C.O.D. service from the United Kingdom is extensive.

British Imperial Postal Orders are issued and paid, and an inland and foreign Money Order system is in operation.

A coastal radio-telegraph station at Takoradi transmits radio-telegrams at 9d. per word.

The Eastern Telegraph Company transmits messages by cable to any part of the world from Accra.

Education.

Education in the Gold Coast has hitherto largely been, and is now to a still greater extent, aided and controlled by Government, and all schools are open to inspection by officers of the Education Department. All teachers are registered, and are paid according to an incrementally graded salary scale.

Apart from a large number of non-aided primary schools, there are twenty-three Government schools and 366 Assisted schools in the Colony, Ashanti, and the Northern Territories. The latest figures show that these Government and Assisted Primary Schools have an enrolment of 44,789 pupils, of whom 11,280 are girls. The largest of the Missions working in these territories is the Presbyterian Church with 113 Assisted Schools followed next in order of size by the Ewe Presbyterian Church with 82 Assisted Schools.

Native Administration schools, the expenditure of which is defrayed partly by Government and partly by the Native Administrations, have been established in the Northern Territories at Bawku, Lawra and Wa; the last-mentioned of these was previously under the entire control of Government. The total number of pupils in these schools in 1935 was 196, of whom 8 were girls.

In addition to the Government Primary Schools there are the Accra Government Technical School and three Middle Boarding Schools in different parts of the country. They are all boarding schools established by Government for the purpose of giving instruction in the more common building and engineering trades with simple literary and technological training.

There are also training schools controlled by the departments concerned, e.g., Agriculture and Forestry, and Animal Health, where pupils are boarded and trained, being paid a salary while undergoing instruction.

Teachers intended for Government service and certain others receive tuition in the Training Department of the Prince of Wales' College, Achimota.

Teachers are also trained at Wesley College, Kumasi, the Presbyterian Training College at Akropong, Akwapim, the Roman Catholic Training College at Cape Coast.

The training of female teachers by Missions, under conditions of grant similar to those applying to male students at the Mission Colleges, has commenced.

There are three residential Secondary Schools at Cape Coast two of which are Government aided, one being under the Methodist Mission and the other under the English Church Mission Local Authority. The third which was opened in January 1936, is controlled by the Roman Catholic Mission.

The Roman Catholic, English Church, Methodist, and Presbyterian Missions each have residential Girls' Schools in which literary and domestic training is given.

The Prince of Wales' College, Achimota, near Accra, which was opened in January, 1927, is a boarding school open to pupils of all nationalities and religions. A complete course of instruction for boys and girls from the kindergarten stage up to the standard of the London University Intermediate Examination is provided there.

The College is administered by a Council consisting partly of elected and partly of nominated members. It is subsidized by Government.

Currency and Banking.

Prior to 1912 and 1913 the currency consisted chiefly of British gold (comparatively rare), silver and copper. In 1912, subsidiary nickel-bronze coins (1d., ½d. and ½d. pieces) were introduced, and in 1913 a special silver currency common to all the British West African Colonies of the same weight and fineness as the corresponding British coins. The coins issued are 2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d. pieces. Owing to the great increase in the demand for currency and the difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies, it was found necessary in 1915 to make British Treasury Notes legal tender, and in 1916 special West African Currency Notes were introduced. 20s. and 10s. Notes are the only values now in circulation, 5l., 2s. and 1s. Notes having been withdrawn. In 1920, owing to the rapid disappearance of silver coins, an alloy coinage was introduced of the same denominations as the silver coins and silver has now practically been withdrawn from circulation. The special West Africa silver and alloy currency and the West African Currency Notes are under the management of the West African Currency Board and are secured by sterling securities held by the Board. Current British gold and silver coins, West Africa Currency silver and alloy coins, West African Currency Notes, and West Africa nickel-bronze coins are all legal tender.

The Bank of British West Africa, Limited, opened at Accra on the 1st January, 1897, and now has branches at all the principal business centres in the Colony.

The Colonial Bank (now Barclay's Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd.) began business at Accra in 1917, and branches have now been opened at other centres. Both Banks have a savings department. In 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established which is now under Post Office management. On 31st December, 1935, the amount to the credit of depositors was 171,568£.

Accounts are kept in sterling.

Population.

The first attempt to take a census was made in 1891, which, however, covered the Colony only. Since then a census has been made at ten-year intervals, viz.:—1901, 1911, 1921 and 1931. Except in 1901, the whole of Ashanti and the Northern Territories have been included. In a country such as the Gold Coast, imperfect communications and lack of education make the holding of a complete census a matter of great difficulty and even now the figures cannot be considered absolutely accurate.

At the mid-year 1935, the population of the Gold Coast was estimated at 3,530,733, as follows:

| Resident Africans | Resident Non-Africans |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Colony           | 1,741,031            |
| Ashanti          | 651,129              |
| Northern Territories | 796,716         |
| Togoland (under British Mandate) | 338,607 |

Total: 3,527,483

Time: 172
The estimated African population of some of the chief towns was as follows:

| Town       | Population |
|------------|------------|
| Accra      | 69,057     |
| Koforidua  | 12,724     |

**ASHANTI.**

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwais, Adansi, Kokofus, Nkwantas, Kumasis, Agumas, Mampongs, Nsutas, Kumawus, Bompatas, Juabins and Ejisus. Each tribe has its own Head Chief, but from time immemorial the King of Kumasi was recognised as the King paramount of the Confederation.

In 1873 the King of Ashanti invaded the British Protectorate with a large army, and reached Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the British forces under Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing. Later in the year Captain (afterwards Sir) John Glover was sent to the eastern districts of the Protectorate to organise the tribes in that quarter, for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet (afterwards Viscount) Wolseley was despatched to the Gold Coast, with British and West Indian troops, native levies, and some seamen and marines, to operate against the Ashantis, starting from Cape Coast. On the 31st of January, 1874, he came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoafial, where he drove them from their position after desperate resistance. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Kumasi. The King had fled to the bush. A few days later Sir John Glover also reached Kumasi. On the 13th, messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fomana, which was afterwards signed.
with a pencil cross by King Kofi. By the Treaty of Fomana, the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold.

In 1894 Prempeh, who was then King of Kumasi, and had successfully fought against the Nkoranzas, who had revolted against his rule, threatened to attack the Atebubus. This attack was averted by the despatch of a force under Sir Francis Scott, and an ultimatum was then sent to Prempeh warning him not to enter British territory, and suggesting that he should acquiesce in the establishment of a Residency at Kumasi. No definite reply to this suggestion could be obtained, and a military expedition accordingly proceeded to Kumasi, to compel compliance with the demands of Her Majesty's Government. The expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Scott, entered Kumasi without resistance, January, 1896. Prempeh made submission, but, failing to comply with the terms dictated, was brought to the coast as a political prisoner and lodged in Elmina Castle, whence he was eventually deported to the Seychelles. A Resident was at the same time installed at Kumasi, and thus commenced an entirely new departure in the relations of the Gold Coast Colony with Ashanti.

In 1900 the Governor visited Kumasi, and was there besieged by the Ashantis, the town being closely invested. Provisions ran short, and a part of the garrison, with the Governor, cut their way out; the rest were relieved by Colonel (afterwards Sir J.) Willcocks, commanding the Ashanti Field Force, on 15th July, after severe fighting. The Ashantis were subsequently thoroughly routed at Abosu.

An Order of the King in Council, dated September 26th, 1901, defined the boundaries of Ashanti, annexed it to His Majesty's Dominions, and provided for its administration under the Governor of the Gold Coast. By a subsequent Order in Council of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Colony and Ashanti, and between Ashanti and the Northern Territories were re-adjusted and defined, with due regard to tribal lands and natural features.

Ashanti is administered by a Chief Commissioner with an Assistant Chief Commissioner as relieving Officer.

The dependency is divided into the following Districts, each under a District Commissioner with limited powers of jurisdiction:

- Ashanti Akim District.
- Bekwai District.
- Kumasi District.
- Mampong District.
- Obuasi District.
- Sunyani District.
- Wenchi District.

The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was extended to Ashanti in 1935. The former Circuit Judge is now a Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of which a Divisional Court has been established at Kumasi. A District Magistrate exercises limited jurisdiction in the town of Kumasi.

The peaceful relations which, under the auspices of the Gold Coast Government, have existed for many years now between the Ashantis and the neighbouring tribes have been signified by not infrequent petitions emanating from the Gold Coast Colony as well as from Ashanti for the return from exile of Prempeh, the former Chief of Kumasi. The confidence felt by the Government of the Gold Coast in the loyalty of the Ashanti people led to the granting of this request in 1924, and to approval being given in 1926 of his election by his people as Omanhene or Head Chief of the Kumasi tribe.

Prempeh died on the 12th May, 1931 and was succeeded by his nephew Osei Agyiman Prempeh II as Omanhene of Kumasi on the 7th July, 1931, who, on the restoration of the Ashanti Confederacy in 1936, assumed the title of Asantehene.

**THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES.**

In 1897 the territories to the north of Ashanti were constituted a separate district with the title of "The Northern Territories," and placed in charge of a Commissioner, and a grant-in-aid of the expenditure in the Northern Territories was voted by Parliament.

Major H. P. Northcott was appointed Commissioner and Commandant of these territories, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. The negotiations between the British and French Governments for the settlement of territorial questions in West Africa, which had been suspended in 1896, were resumed in October, 1897; and on 14th June, 1898, after a period of considerable tension in consequence of the proximity of the British and French forces in the disputed territories, a Convention was signed at Paris with a proviso that it should be ratified within six (subsequently extended to twelve) months. By this Convention the boundary between the Gold Coast and the French Colony of the Ivory Coast, which had only been settled in 1889, as far as the 9th parallel of north latitude, was continued northwards along the course of the Black Volta River to the 11th parallel, and it was then drawn along the 11th parallel with a deflection to the north in the neighbourhood of Mamprusi, until it met the Franco-German boundary of 1897.

The effect of the Anglo-French Convention of 14th June, 1898, was to leave Bona, Lobi, and Moshi to France, while Dagati, Wa, Mamprusi, and the southern portion of Grunshi were included in the British sphere.

On 14th November, 1899, an agreement was concluded with Germany for the partition of the "neutral zone." This partition assigned Salaga to Great Britain, and Yendi to Germany, and to the north of the zone gave Mamprusi to the former and Chakosi to the latter.

Survey operations were undertaken by Anglo-French and Anglo-German Commissions during 1901-2, for the delimitation of those portions of the boundaries which had not yet been settled.

By the demarcation on the ground of the Anglo-German boundary between the Trans-Volta District and the adjoining Colony of Togo; of the Anglo-German boundary north of the 9th parallel of north latitude; and of the Anglo-French boundary along the 11th parallel of north latitude, all the frontiers of the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories have now been exactly defined.

Provision was made for the administration of the Northern Territories under the Gold Coast Government by an Order of the King in Council of 26th September, 1901.

The Northern Territories are administered by a Chief Commissioner with an Assistant Chief Commissioner as Relieving Officer. They are divided into the Mamprusi, Wa, Lawra-Tumu, Dagomba and Gonja Districts, with headquarters at Gambaga, Wa, Lawra, Yendi and Bole.

The dependency is divided into two Provinces, Northern and Southern, comprising Mamprusi, Wa, Lawra-Tumu Districts in the Northern, and Dagomba and Gonja Districts, together with Krachi.
District, within the Northern Section of Togoland under British Mandate in the Southern, with the Headquarters of the Protectorate at Tamale in the Southern Province, 237 miles north of Kumasi.

By Order in Council, of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Northern Territories and Ashanti were re-adjusted and defined.

An important step was taken with regard to the Government of this Protectorate by replacing, with effect from the 1st of January, 1907, the former semi-military administration by a staff of Civil District and Assistant District Commissioners, and by establishing new stations. Simultaneously, the 2nd Battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment was disbanded and a force of armed constabulary substituted therefor. In 1929, the Northern Territories Constabulary was disbanded and their duties taken over by the Gold Coast Police.

The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was extended to the Northern Territories in 1935. The former Circuit Judge, Ashanti, who exercised in the N.T. powers similar to those which he exercised in Ashanti, is now a Puane Judge of the Supreme Court.

TOGOLAND UNDER BRITISH MANDATE.

The former German protectorate of Togoland is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, bounded on the east by Dahomey and on the west by the Gold Coast and its Protectorates. The actual coast-line lies between 1° 45' and 1° 14' W. longitude, the frontiers, however, especially on the west, opening out considerably. The total area is about 36,500 square miles.

Until 1884-85 the majority of the tribes along the littoral and its immediate hinterland, also those adjoining the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast regarded themselves as being under the suzerainty of Great Britain, but by agreements made with the French on the 24th December, 1885, and with the British on the 14th and 28th July, 1886, when provisional frontiers were fixed, German influence was formally recognized by those Powers. Subsequent agreements dated the 23rd July, 1897, and the 14th November, 1899, between Germany and the Governments of France and Great Britain respectively defined the northern frontiers of Togoland.

Immediately upon the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany Togoland was invaded by the Gold Coast forces. On the 6th August, 1914, Captain E. B. Barker entered the capital, Lome, under a flag of truce and on the following day that town and the hinterland for a distance of 120 kilometres from the sea were surrendered. On the 8th August Anecho (Petit Popo) was occupied by the French. Operations on a larger scale commenced on the 11th August when Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel F. C. Bryant landed at Lome. After engagements at Agbelufoe and Chra River on the 16th and 24th August respectively the enemy retired on the great wireless station at Kamina, which they destroyed. On the 26th August the Acting-Governor surrendered the Colony unconditionally.

Pour parlers then took place between Sir Hugh Clifford, governor of the Gold Coast, and M. Noufflard, governor of Dahomey, as the result of which an agreement, subsequently ratified by the governments concerned was drawn up. Under this agreement Togoland was provisionally divided into British and French spheres. To the British were allotted the western administrative areas of Lome and Lomeland, Misahoe, Kete-Krachi and Yendi, and to the French Anecho, Atakpame, Sokode and Sansanne Mangu.

By proclamation dated the 30th September, 1914, civil courts were established under the presidency of political officers seconded from the Gold Coast, appeal lying from the district courts to that of a senior political officer. In the absence of a local criminal code, that of the Gold Coast was introduced as a basis of procedure.

In June, 1915, the office of senior political officer was merged in that of the senior military commander, without prejudice, however, to the civil nature of the court concerned.

Boundary adjustments with the French took place in 1920 in accordance with an agreement signed by Lord Milner and M. Simon on 10th July, 1919. Lome and the whole of the coast were given over to the French, and the British received additional territory in the interior. The area of the British sphere is 13,041 square miles.

In October, 1921, the Council of the League of Nations approved in principle the arrangements made between the British and French Governments for the division of Togoland in accordance with the agreement of 10th July, 1919, and the application to the territories of the Mandate system; and on 20th July, 1922, after a delay due to negotiations between the United States Government and the Mandatory Powers, the Council confirmed the mandates and defined their terms.†

Togoland under British Mandate is now administered under the provisions of the British Sphere of Togoland Order in Council, 1923, which was issued on the 11th of October, 1923.

Under this instrument, the British Sphere is divided into the Northern Section and the Southern Section. The Northern Section is administered as if it formed part of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, and the Southern Section is administered as if it formed part of the Eastern Province of the Gold Coast Colony. The Chief Commissioner's Court of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast exercises jurisdiction in the Northern Section; and the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast Colony exercises the jurisdiction in the Southern Section.

Subject to the terms of the Mandate, the law for the time being in force in the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast is the law in force in the Northern Section, and the law for the time being in force in the Gold Coast Colony is the law in force in the Southern Section. The Governor of the Gold Coast Colony is empowered to enact Ordinances with respect to the British Sphere as a whole, or with respect to either Section thereof separately. Togoland under British Mandate is not distinguished from the Gold Coast in the statistical returns, but it is beyond question that the revenue which it brings to the Gold Coast is inconsiderable compared with the money expended upon it. It contains no part of the old German railway system, which retains most of the export and import trade of the Southern and richest Section. The towns of Ho and Kpadu are joined to the Gold Coast road system by a road which meets the Volta River at Senchi where there is a power ferry. There is also a direct road from Yendi to Tamale.
