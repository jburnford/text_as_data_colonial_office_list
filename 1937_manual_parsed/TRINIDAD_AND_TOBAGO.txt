TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is 50 miles, its average breadth 37 miles, and its area 1,802 square miles. It is separated from S. America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands and Venezuela is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and took possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years

afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1596, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Roume de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago at the census of 1931 was 412,783. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish. There is also a large number of East Indians, totalling 137,583. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of seven members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted by Letters Patent and an Order in Council which came into operation on 21st August, 1924. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, nine nominated official members, six nominated unofficial members and seven elected members. Trinidad is divided into six electoral districts, each returning one member. Tobago forms the seventh electoral district.

**General Description.**

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The climate of Trinidad is tropical and may be divided into two seasons, a dry season from January to the middle of May, with an average rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December, with an average of 8 inches per month. The coolest months of the year are December to April. The average temperature during the day is 84 and during the night 74. The total rainfall in 1935, from records taken at 121 stations, was 73.82 ins. The climate is healthy and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided reasonable precautions are taken.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising to 3,085 feet; the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1931, 70,334), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1935, 32 vessels registered. Fifteen miles of electric tramway and 21,950 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

**Production and Industry, Trade and Customs.**

The quantity and value of the principal products exported during the year 1935 were:

| Product                  | Quantity       | Value     |

| Sugar                    | 236,765,760 lbs| 4,522,421 |

**Sugar.**—The sugar crop yielded 117,780 tons in 1935. In 1935 cane farmers sold 402,287 tons of canes to the factories, for which they received $1,061,885. In 1934 the tonnage sold was 370,153, and the value $907,199. The sugar manufacturers again voluntarily maintained a basic price of $2.64 per ton.

**Coconuts.**—The value of the exports of coconuts, copra and coconut oil in 1935 was $241,988 compared with $126,350 in 1934.

The factories established in 1930 continued to manufacture copra products, and as a result the sum of $86,914 was distributed by copra producers by way of bonus, while 410,044 gallons edible oil, and 1,402,377 lbs. lard substitute were manufactured, of which 4,448 gallons of edible oil were exported. Excise duty collected during 1935 on edible oil, lard substitute locally manufactured and consumed amounted to $43,652.
Asphalt.—The asphalt lake, 114 acres in extent, situated in the Ward of La Brea, was first leased as a whole in 1888 for 21 years. The lease was renewed for a further period of 21 years from the 1st February, 1909. In February, 1925, a fresh lease of the lake comprising 109 acres was made to the Trinidad Lake Asphalt, Limited, for 21 years from the 1st February, 1930, on payment of the following Royalties and Export Duties:

For each ton of Crude Pitch or Asphaltum a Royalty of 60c. and an Export Duty of $1.20.

For each ton of Dried Pitch or Asphaltum a Royalty of 84c. and an Export Duty of $1.66.

The quantity of asphalt produced during 1935 was 134,578 tons as against 92,829 tons in 1934.

The quantity of Asphalt exported during 1935 was 82,359 tons to the value of $1,092,982 and yielding a revenue of $194,513, as compared with 55,992 tons exported in 1934 of a value of $797,050 and yielding a revenue of $135,140.

Petroleum.—At the close of 1935 there were 14 Companies actively engaged in the exploitation of oil in the Colony. These Companies, having a total share capital of approximately $40,800,000, held over 225,052 acres of Crown Lands under licenses and leases, of which approximately 117,115 acres were held under mining lease. In addition, appreciable areas of private lands are held. Up to 30th January, 1902, oil rights were not reserved by the Government when disposing of Crown Land, but after that year all Crown grants reserved the oil rights to the Crown. There are, consequently, three categories of oil lands, viz., lands disposed of prior to 1902 in which the oil rights rest in the surface owner; land sold since that date in which the oil rights are reserved to the Crown, and lands where both the surface and the underlying oil remain the property of the Crown.

The principal oil producing companies are the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Fyzabad, Barrackpore, etc.; the United British Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Point Fortin, Parry Lands, etc.; the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Apex (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Fyzabad, Siparia; the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaquite and Guapo; the Kern (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited from Crown and private lands at Guapo; the Trinidad Oilfields Operating Co., Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Palo Seco, Fyzabad and San Francique; the Trinidad Petroleum Development Co., Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Palo Seco; New Dome Oilfields from private lands at Fyzabad; the Siparia Trinidad Oilfields, Ltd., from Crown lands at Palo Seco; the Trinidad Investments Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Oropouche. The Palo Seco Oilfields (C.C. Stollmeyer) from Crown lands at Palo Seco; The Petroleum Options (1925) Ltd. from private lands at San Francique; and the Coldan Co., Ltd. from private lands at Fyzabad. There are refineries at Pointe-à-Pierre, Point Fortin, Brighton, Tabaquite, La Brea and San Francique, and all grades of petroleum products from petrol to road oil are produced. The total quantity of oil produced during 1935 was 11,671,224 barrels, an increase of 776,861 barrels as compared with the production for 1934. Of this total 7,544,427 barrels were from Crown Lands or lands in which the oil rights belonged to the Crown. The Royalty paid by operating companies on oil, won from Crown rights during the year 1935, amounted to $605,279 as against $416,924 in 1934 and wayleaves to $1,422 as against $1,742 in 1934. The quantity of crude oil and products exported amounted to 10,993,540 barrels valued at $13,321,708 as against 9,981,774 barrels valued at $14,056,128 in 1934.

Grape Fruit.—Large areas have been planted, and the area under cultivation amounted in 1935 to 2,700 acres. The exports during the year 1935 amounted to 51,119 boxes and 7,724 loose fruit, valued at $203,870.

Lime Fruit.—The value of the lime and lime produce exported during the year 1935 amounted to $74,338 as compared with $120,264 in the previous year.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,287,236 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1935, was estimated to be approximately 690,413 acres. About 377,050 acres are under cultivation.

The chief imports are textiles, flour and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery and lumber. 44 per cent. of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom.

Under the Customs Tariff, goods of Empire origin are admitted at a preferential rate of duty, the principal items being entitled to a preference of 50 per cent. of the general rate of duty. Approximately one half the list of items on the tariff are chargeable with duty ad valorem, the remainder, including all high duty goods, being subject to specific duties.

The following tables show the direction of the import and export trade of the Colony for 1935:

Municipalities.

In 1914 Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.

The next town and port is San Fernando, about 30 miles south from Port of Spain. The population at the census of 1931 was 14,287. San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population at 1931 census, 5,072). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1935, was $963,700, the expenditure $928,187, and the debt was $1,600,600 on the 31st December, 1935. This includes the loan for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

Means of Communication.

The Government coastal steamers maintain three direct trips per week between Port of Spain (Trinidad) and Scarborough (Tobago). A weekly call is made at Roxborough (Tobago) and a fortnightly call at Blanchisseuse on the North Coast of Trinidad and the following Tobago ports—King's Bay, Speyside, Man-o'-War Bay, Bloody Bay, Parlatuvier, Castara. Pembroke, Plymouth, Mount Levine, Milford and Hillsboro in Tobago are served when inducement offers.

The railway system consists of the following:

- The Port of Spain—Arima—Sangre Grande line (opened in 1897) 29 miles along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast.
- The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1880, San Fernando in 1882, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.
- The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabaquite in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction (14½ miles from Port of Spain) and running in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.
- The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Marabella Junction (33 miles from Port of Spain) and running in an easterly direction to Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles, and
- The Cipero tramway, to the south of San Fernando, also proceeding by another route to Princes Town.

The total length of this system is 118 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 6 trains daily each way.

Road transport feeder services between the principal terminal stations and the coast provide for through transport between all the Districts of the Colony.

The railway stations are in telegraphic or telephonic communication one with the other on all parts of the system, giving a total length of about 135 miles of telegraph and about 40 miles of telephone lines. There is also a service telephone along the Cipero Section between San Fernando and Princes Town.

The total receipts from the railways, railway steamers, telegraph and telephones for the year 1935 amounted to $604,402, and the working expenses to $687,728, exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to $300,795. There was, therefore, a net loss on working of $88,012, as compared with a loss of $98,140 in the previous year.

The total number of passengers carried during 1935 was 1,183,169. The total tonnage of goods was 422,960 tons.

The roads are divided into main and local roads. The former and 58 per cent. of the latter are under the control of the Public Works Department. The other local roads amounting to 534 miles are under Local Road Boards. The main roads, with a total mileage of 1,080 miles, are made up of 397 miles metalled or gravelled and oiled, 298 miles metalled, 183 miles gravelled, 40 miles pitched and 162 miles natural soil roads. The local roads in Districts where there are no Local Road Boards comprise 763 miles and are made up of 29 miles metalled or gravelled and oiled, 96 miles metalled, 283 miles gravelled, 28 miles pitched and 317 miles natural soil roads. In addition there are many miles of Crown Traces in charge of the Wardens.

There are several garages in Port-of-Spain where motor cars can be engaged to convey passengers to any part of the Colony. At most of the railway stations motor cars can be hired to carry passengers to outlying parts. Motor omnibuses also ply on the main roads, and in some of the suburbs of Port-of-Spain.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and 118 out-offices throughout the Colony.

The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

- Within Colony ... ... ... 2d.
- To U.K., India and British Colonies, for 1st oz. ... ... ... 3d.
- and for each additional oz. or fraction of oz. ... ... ... 2d.
- To other places, for 1st oz. ... ... ... 6d.
- and for each additional oz. ... ... ... 3d.

Communication by cable with the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and other parts of the world is maintained by the Pacific Cable Board (All Red Route) and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company. The Pacific Cable Board and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company are both now under the management of Cable & Wireless Ltd. of Electric House, London.

A wireless system is maintained between the following Islands—Barbados, Grenada, Carriacou, St. Lucia, Antigua, Montserrat and St. Kitts.

The principal tariffs are:

- To the United Kingdom from Port-of-Spain ... ... ... 56c. per word
- To Eastern Canada ... ... ... 36c. ...
- To Western Canada ... ... ... 41c. ...

There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.
Three wireless stations are maintained by the Trinidad Government at Port-of-Spain and North Post in Trinidad, and at Scarborough in Tobago. The North Post Station deals exclusively with ship, Tobago and Martinique traffic, while communication with British Guiana, Venezuela and Paramaribo is carried out by Port-of-Spain. Negotiations are proceeding between the Government and Cable and Wireless Limited with a view to the Company taking over the Government Wireless Stations.

Steamers calling at Trinidad comprise the following lines:—Aluminium Line, American Caribbean Line, American-South African Line, Bermuda and West Indies Line, Canadian National Steamships, Canadian Transport Company, Compania Anonima Venezolana de Navegacion Compagnie General Transatlantique, Fyffe Line, Hamburg Amerikanische Paketfahrt-Aktiengesellschaft, Harrison Lines, Horn Line, Lamport and Holt, McCormick S. S. Co. (Pacific Argentine, Brazil Line Inc.), Munson Line, Nourse Line, Ocean Dominion New York Service, Ocean Dominion S.S. Corporation, Prince Line, Robin Line, Royal Netherlands Steamship Co. (1), Colon Line (2), Surinam Line, Societe Generale de Transports Maritime, Societa Italia and the Standard Oil Company of Venezuela Wilhelmsen Line. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by some of these steamers.

In addition an increasing number of steamers call to load oil cargoes, or to take in coal or fuel oil for bunker purposes. During the winter months a number of tourist ships call.

Air Mail and Passenger Services are maintained by the Pan American Airways Inc. with the United States of America via St. Lucia, Antigua, St. Thomas, Porto Rico and Havana, with Buenos Aires via Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Para, Paramaribo and Georgetown, and with Venezuela touching at Caripito, La Guaira, and Maracaibo and onwards to Canal Zone, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Jamaica, Ecuador, British Honduras and the Republic of Honduras.

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and Trinidad Government notes are legal tender. Accounts are kept in dollars (1 dollar = 50 pence), and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1933 an Ordinance provided for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been issued, but the $1,000 notes were withdrawn and destroyed on the 21st December, 1934. The total value in circulation at 31st December, 1935, amounted to $606,000.

Government Savings Banks are established in 38 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1935 was 45,438, with deposits amounting to $2,182,880.

The Commercial Banks are (1) Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., with a note circulation in the Colony estimated at $1,200,000; (2) the Royal Bank of Canada, with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of $1,500,000; (3) The Canadian Bank of Commerce, with an authorized note circulation of $750,000; (4) Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company, Limited, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce have Savings Bank branches and pay interest at the rate of 1½ per cent., while the Government Savings Bank pays 3 per cent. on amounts up to $2,400. The Bank of Messrs. Gordon Grant and Co., Limited, is not a bank of issue. In addition to the above Banks there is the Trinidad Co-operative Bank, an institution established in 1914, for the encouragement of thrift.

Education.

At the close of 1934 there were 292 primary and intermediate schools in the Colony, 45 being Government and 247 assisted schools. There were 258 schools in Trinidad and 36 in Tobago.

The number of pupils on the roll in December, 1935 was 70,948. The average daily attendance was 47,510, or 67 per cent. of the number on roll. As compared with the previous year there was a decrease of 2,961 on the roll, and an increase of 17 per cent in average attendance. The number of teachers and pupil teachers employed was 1,859 (1,910 in 1934).

The total expenditure on education during the year 1935, deducting the amount received in school and examination fees, was $823,335 as compared with $798,629 in 1934.

Secondary Education.

The following Colleges afford facilities for the higher education of boys.—The Queen's Royal College and its affiliated institutions, the St. Mary's College in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima College in San Fernando, the Bishop's High School in Tobago. The St. Joseph's Convent and the St. Hilary's High School in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima Girls' High School at San Fernando, which are also affiliated to the Queen's Royal College, provide similar education for girls.

The affiliated institutions work under the same curriculum as the Queen's Royal College, and receive a Government grant-in-aid.

A Government Training College for Teachers at Port-of-Spain was attended by about 80 students in 1935.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institution for the instruction of the blind.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Capt. Keymis in the Darting and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealander were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampus procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.
In 1664 the grant of the Island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral Estras, to evacuate the island the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefray and General Cuylar, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Situation and Area.

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long, distant from Barbados 120 miles, from Grenada 75 miles, and from Trinidad, 26 miles. It is 26 miles long and 7½ miles at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 116 square miles, or 74,392 acres, of which about 42,000 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The population of Tobago in 1931 was 25,358 according to census.

General Description.—Tobago.

Tobago is a Ward of Trinidad and its exports out of the Colony all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the Colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, live stock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1935 was $394,513, made up as follows:

- Cacao: $169,710
- Coconuts: $17,307
- Copra: $73,196
- Other Products: $134,300

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1931, of 833. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a coastal steamer service, provided by the Government.

The island possesses a fair mileage of motor roads.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Methodist bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represented Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.
