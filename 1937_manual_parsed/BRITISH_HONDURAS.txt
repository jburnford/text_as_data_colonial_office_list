BRITISH HONDURAS.

Situation and Area.

British Honduras is a Colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the Falls of Gracias a Dios on the River Sarstoon, to Garbutt's Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier, on the south of Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. It lies between 18°29' and 15°54' N. latitude and 89°15' and 87°60' W. longitude.

The area of the Colony is 8,598 square miles, (about the size of Wales), including Albion Island in the River Hondo (about 26 square miles), and Ambergris, St. George's, English, Turneffe and other Cays (Islands), 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. It is estimated that about 175 square miles are under cultivation.

History.

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, about 1638, by adventurers, who were attracted by the logwood which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were long at St. George's Cay. The name of the present chief town and of the River Belize is alleged to be a corruption of the name of the buccaneer Wallis, who was driven from Hispaniola in that year, and who is said to have been the leader of the settlers. The Spaniards frequently endeavoured to expel the logcutters; but, though they succeeded in driving them from the northern coast of Yucatan about 1717, they failed to dislodge them from the eastern coast.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito coast, in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers, and their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protection, and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain, and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Ruatan, and at Black River on the mainland. Ruatan was abandoned in 1749, but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements on the Mosquito Coast. As a result of the treaty of Paris in 1763, the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay," the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms. By the Treaty of Versailles of 1783 Spain recognised a district (within what is now British Honduras) within which the British logcutters might work without interference; and by the Convention of London signed in 1786, it was agreed that the British Colonists should evacuate the Mosquito Coast and the adjacent islands. In spite of these treaties, many of the settlers remained outside the agreed limits; and it was not until the treaties of 1859 with the Republic of Honduras and 1860 with Nicaragua that the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast were finally recognised as belonging to those states, Nicaragua agreeing to allow the Mosquito Indians autonomy in the Reserve which was assigned to them.

On the 10th of September, 1931, Belize was visited by a hurricane and tidal wave which caused great damage and loss of life.

Constitution.

The first settlers from 1638 to 1786 managed their own affairs. Persons were annually elected to act as Magistrates at public meetings held for the purpose. These Magistrates discharged all executive and judicial functions. Resolutions were passed at public meetings, and they formed the laws binding on the community. In 1765 these customs were formally recognised by the King's Government, after the visit of Admiral Sir William Burnaby to the settlement in that year. The customs of the settlers were codified and published, and became known as "Burnaby's Laws."

In 1786 a Superintendent was appointed by the Home Government, but during the years 1790-1797 elected Magistrates again ruled the settlements. From this latter date Superintendents were regularly appointed until 1862. An Executive Council was established in 1840 to assist the Superintendent, and in 1853 a Legislative Assembly was formally constituted consisting of 18 elected and 3 nominated members. The settlement was declared a Colony on the 12th May, 1862, and a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica. In 1870 the Legislative Assembly was abolished by a local enactment, and a Legislative Council substituted therefor, consisting of five official, and not less than four unofficial members, with the Lieutenant Governor as President. The constitution of the Council was altered in 1892, after a dispute with the Governor, and became three ex-officio members and not less than five (nominated) unofficial members with the Governor as President. Since 1913 the Council has consisted of six official and seven unofficial members. A new Legislative Council was constituted in 1936 (under Ordinance No. 13 of 1935) with the Governor as President, three ex-officio and two nominated members, two unofficial members nominated by the Governor and five unofficial members elected by four constituencies. On the 31st October, 1894, Letters Patent were proclaimed constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, which rendered the Colony independent of Jamaica. These were renewed by Letters Patent proclaimed on the 10th September, 1909.

The English Common Law and all statutes of the Imperial Parliament "in abrogation or derogation or in any way declaratory of the Common Law passed before 1899 extend to the Colony as far as local circumstances render such extension suitable, and subject to modification by Colonial ordinances. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 31 of 1923, a new and revised edition of the Laws of this Colony has been published in two volumes. This edition, referred to as "The Consolidated Laws, 1924," came into force on the 4th February, 1925, and supersedes the revised edition published in 1915 and all ordinances passed before July, 1924. Appeals to His Majesty in Council are regulated by Chapter 155 of the Consolidated Laws, 1924.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, and official and unofficial members; three of the official members are ex officio, four other members being appointed.

For administrative purposes the Colony is divided into six districts: Belize, which includes...
Though situated within the tropics, the climate is sub-tropical in character. The maximum shade temperature is 90°, the minimum 62°. The dew
the capital at the mouth of the river of the same name; the Corozal district; the Orange Walk district; the Cayo district; the Stann Creek district; and the Toledo district, the main station of which is Punta Gorda.

General Description.

In its physical outlines the Colony resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached. The characteristic soils of the Colony are known as Colume ridge (the vegetable alluvium along the river valleys), the Pine ridge (sandy tracts covered with pines, scrub, and wiry grass), and Broken ridge (intermediate between these two). Besides these there are swamp, savannah, and mountain.

The chief rivers are in the north of the Colony, and run in a north-easterly direction, the Belize reaching the sea on the east, and the Hondo and the New River on the north.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockscorn Mountains a height of some 3,700 feet is attained. That district of the Colony remained until 1879 wholly unexplored, when it was traversed by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr. Fowler, from Garbutt's Falls on the Belize River, at the western frontier, to the sea coast south of Deep River. The country proved to be a succession of valleys and hills, from 1,200 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The westerly portion was an open undulating grassy country, forming magnificent pasturage lands. Towards the coast it was all forest, full of valuable timber. No inhabitants were seen, but ancient Indian ruins, consisting of large stone buildings, were discovered. The soil generally was rich, and indications of minerals were noticed.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

For more than 200 years the Colony has subsisted mainly on the natural resources of its forests. In 1935, the percentage values of exports of domestic produce were forest produce 65-30, agricultural produce 28-42, and marine produce 1-39. A Forest Department has been in existence since 1922.

The chief items of export in 1935 were as follows:—Mahogany logs, 159,500 cubic feet; mahogany lumber, 333,667 cubic feet; cedar logs and lumber, 20,708 cubic feet; chicke, 735,240 lbs.; coconuts, 6,589,320; copra, 5,230 lbs.; bananas, 356,066 bunches; plantains, 162,560; grape fruit 15,450 cwt.

Belize is a port of registry, and there were registered on 31st December, 1935, 188 vessels aggregating 2,575 tons net.

The imports consist mainly of mahogany and chicle in transit, cotton goods, petroleum oils, hardware, haberdashery and millinery, boots and shoes, spirits, tobacco and provisions.

The percentages of the Imports, Exports and Total Trade during 1935 as between Empire Countries and Foreign Markets are shown hereunder:

| Imports | Exports | Trade |
|---------|---------|-------|
| United Kingdom | 27.32% | 34.06% | 23.97% |
| Canada | 9.85% | 5.43% | 7.18% |
| Other British Possessions | 3.94% | 1.27% | 3.67% |
| United States of America | 27.88% | 58.29% | 41.26% |
| Other Countries | 31.01% | .95% | 23.92% |

(c)

The Customs tariff is largely on an ad valorem basis. There is a British preference, which, in the case of ad valorem duties, is in most instances 12½ per cent ad valorem.

Communications.

The easiest communication is by water along the coast. There is communication weekly with New Orleans, Puerto Barrios and Puerto Cortes, and monthly (approximately) with Liverpool. There is also a fortnightly mail and passenger service by the Canadian National Steamship Company with Jamaica, and thence to Canada via the Bahamas and Bermuda. The usual length of the journey between England and British Honduras is 16 days, via the United States and about 21 days via Jamaica. Telegraphic communication with Europe is maintained by a land line to Consejo on the Hondo River, which connects, by a cable across the Hondo, with the Mexican Telegraph System through Payo Obispo in Yucatan (1911); and by radio-telegraphic communication with New Orleans (1915) and Jamaica (1928).

A telegraph and telephone line has also been constructed from Belize to the most southerly town of Punta Gorda, and another from Belize to the Cayo. A Radio-telegraph Station is situated at Belize, and another (for inland services only), at Corozal.

Belize is a stopping place of the planes of the Pan American Airway, Inc., on the Company's weekly air mail and passenger service with Miami, Florida. There is a weekly service between Belize and San Pedro, Sula, Honduras (via Puerto Barrios, Guatemala) by planes of the Transportes Aereos Centro-Americanos Ltd.

A short railway leads from the town of Stann Creek, 25 miles inland, the first section of which was opened towards the end of 1908, and the second section in March, 1909. The line was practically completed in 1910, but extraordinary floods in 1911 carried away a couple of bridges, and did other damage, which have been replaced.

Rates of Postage.

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Within the Colony | per 2 oz. 3 cents, 1 cent per each subsequent oz. or fraction of an oz. |
| To Canada and the B.W.I. generally | per oz. or fraction, 3 cents. |
| To the United Kingdom, British Possessions (except as above) and Egypt | per oz. or fraction of an oz., 2 cents. |
| United States and elsewhere | 5 cents for first oz., and 3 cents for each subsequent oz. or fraction of an oz. |

Air Mail.

To U.S.A. (via Miami, Fla.), Mexico (via Merida and Vera Cruz), Guatemala and Honduras (via Puerto Barrios) and Nicaragua (via Managua), 15 cents for each fractional half-ounce, Costa Rica and Panama (including Canal Zone), 20 cents for each fractional half-ounce or less (in addition to the ordinary postage).

Climate.

Though situated within the tropics, the climate is sub-tropical in character. The maximum shade temperature is 90°, the minimum 62°. The dew
point in Belize, a seaport, is relatively high. Sea breezes prevail for the greater part of the year. The average rainfall during the past twenty years has been 81.48 inches per annum. From the middle of February to the middle of May is the dry season. For the rest of the year there is rain to some extent during every month, the heaviest rainfall being in the months of September, October and November, during which months about one-third of the total rain occurs.

Currency and Banking.

By Ordinance No. 31 of 1894, the currency was established on a gold basis, the United States gold dollar being adopted as the standard coin. Gold coins of the United States Mint are legal tender for the amounts of their respective denominations in standard dollars; also the British sovereign and half-sovereign for the amounts of $4.867 and $2.433 respectively. There is a local subsidiary currency of 50 cent, 25 cent, 10 cent, and 5 cent silver pieces, and a Government note issue of the following denominations: 1, 2, 5 and 10 dollars; a nickel bronze 5 cent piece and a bronze cent piece are also current. The silver coins are legal tender up to 10 dollars and the nickel and bronze up to 50 cents. The Government Savings Bank, established in 1846 at Belize (with branches at Corozal, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda and the Cayo), had, on 31st December, 1935, $301,430.

On the 14th October, 1912, The Bank of British Honduras, Ltd., was bought over as a going concern by the Royal Bank of Canada. Banking business of every character is conducted.

Education.

The schools, both Secondary and Primary, are, with one or two exceptions, denominational. With few exceptions, all Primary schools are inspected and aided by the Colonial Government. Seventy-six received aid in 1935, to the extent of $64,989, with 8,433 scholars on the roll, and 6,488 average attendance, i.e. 76-9% of the enrolment. The total cost of Primary education for the year was $86,208.

The total number of pupils on the roll in all the schools was about 9,116, with an average attendance of 7,073.

A law "To provide for Compulsory Education in certain cases," was passed in January, 1915. This Law was replaced by Law No. 14 of 1926, which applies generally to all school areas where it is practicable to enforce it.

Population.

The population of the several Districts of the Colony, based on the census taken on the 26th April, 1931, was:

Belize District ........... 21,661
Corozal District .......... 6,885
Orange Walk District ..... 5,895
Stann Creek District ...... 4,960
Toledo District ........... 6,252
Cayo District ............. 5,694

Total .................... 51,347

Of the total population 44,670 were, at the date of the 1931 census, British subjects. Of this number, 216 were born in the United Kingdom. There were 181 Americans, of whom 165 were born in the United States, and 1,083 Mexicans who were all born in Mexico.

Population of towns at census of 1931: Belize, 16,687; Corozal, 2,197; Orange Walk, 1,099; Stann Creek, 2,844; Mullins River, 332; Punta Gorda, 1,119; Monkey River, 396; El Cayo, 1,260; Benque Viejo, 1,211.

The estimated population, as at 31st December, 1935, was 55,448; of these 27,410 were males and 28,038 females.
