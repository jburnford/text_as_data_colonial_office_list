ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 46° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. The province of Aden (the total area of which, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles) consists of two old craters forming rocky peninsulas:—Aden proper (area 21 square miles; population 34,471), on the south, and Little Aden (area 15 square miles) on the west—and a flat strip of coast, about three miles broad (area 39 square miles; population, including Sheikh Othman, Imad, and Hiswa, 12,167). The peninsulas form the horns of a bay called Aden Back Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. The native town of Aden is situated on the east of the Aden peninsula, opposite a gap in the crater walls. On the west side of the peninsula, some five miles from the town, is Steamer Point, off which the large steamers lie. The highest point of the peninsula is 1,725 feet above sea level. The average annual rainfall is about 3 inches, and the maximum is about 8 inches. The climate is very hot and damp, especially during the summer months.

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians, the Persians and the early Caliphs. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1551 and held it until they evacuated the Yemen in 1630. The Aden peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchases in 1882 and 1888.

Aden is an important oil fuel and bunkering station, and also an entrepôt for the trade with Arabia. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc.

The Aden Protectorate, which includes the Hadhramaut, covers an area of about 42,000 square miles and includes the territories of a number of Chiefs and tribes in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. The Resident and Commander-in-Chief deals with Protectorate matters under the direct control of His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies. It has a population of over 100,000.

The Aden Protectorate borders on the Arab State of the Yemen, with which there have been frequent frontier difficulties for several years. These were adjusted by a treaty signed at San'a (the capital of the Yemen) between His Majesty's Government and the King of the Yemen, on 11th February 1934, by the terms of which the status quo on the date of signature is to be preserved for the duration of the treaty, a period or 40 years. Prior to signature the King of the Yemen by mutual agreement, evacuated certain parts of the Protectorate which were in his occupation.

Administration.

The administration of Aden was formerly directly under the Government of Bombay, but new arrangements came into operation in 1928. The Imperial Government then became responsible for military and political affairs in Aden and the Aden Protectorate. The province of Aden itself remained under the Government of India. The financial settlement required by this division of authority provided for the payment by India to Imperial Revenues of £150,000 a year. This amount was considerably less than the annual expenditure falling upon Indian revenue under the former system of control.

The administrative control of the Settlement of Aden was transferred from the Bombay Government on 1st April, 1932, when Aden was formed into a separate province under the direct control of the Government of India.

Under the provision of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Aden Settlement will on the appointed date (1st April, 1937) cease to be a part of British India, and on the control being then transferred to H.M. Government in the United Kingdom, it will become a Colony, and the financial contribution paid by the Government of India will cease.

The administration will be vested in a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Aden Colony Order-in-Council, 1936, provides that the law previously in force shall continue to be operative unless and until modified by Order-in-Council or Ordinance of the Colony. The management of the port is under the control of a Board of Trustees formed in 1888. The principal business of the Port Trust in recent years has been the deepening of the harbour so as to allow vessels of large size to enter and leave at all states of the tide. The police force, consisting of land, harbour and armed police, has recently been reorganised.

Aden is a free port and there is no customs tariff. Excise duty is, however, levied on spirits, wines and beer, perfumed spirits, intoxicating and dangerous drugs on specific duty basis.

PERIM, a bare rocky island, five square miles in area, with a population of 1,700, lies in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, about 1½ miles from the south-west corner of Arabia. It possesses a good harbour on the south-west side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth. It was occupied by the British in 1799, but subsequently abandoned, and was only re-occupied in 1857, when the overland route to India made the position important. It is a coaling, oil-fuel and cable station, and forms part of the province† of Aden.

SOCOTRA, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 19′—12° 42′ N. lat., and 53° 21′—53° 30′ E. long. and lying in the direction to India, has been since 1876 under the Government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Qishu, on the Arabian mainland, to whom it belongs. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island is about 12,000. It is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October, 1886, together with the neighbouring Abdul Kari and Bromers Islands.
