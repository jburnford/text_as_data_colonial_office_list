Geographical Features
Brunei has a coastline of about 100 miles, and is split into two and surrounded on the landward sides by Sarawak. In the west the valleys of the Belait and the Tutong rivers, representing more than half the area of the country, consist of extensive swamps gradually changing through a series of ridge and swamp formations into low hills at the sources of the rivers. The Labi hills in the extreme west cover an area of some 300 square miles and at no point exceed 1,300 feet in height. In the east the Brunei district is characterized by a number of steep rocky hills of no great height rising from alluvial flats, while Temburong, except near the coast, is hilly, becoming mountainous as one approaches Bukit Pagon, a spur from the main Bornean range.

Climate
There are no well-defined seasons, but the rainfall tends to be heaviest from October to the middle of January. The annual rainfall varies from 100 inches at the coast to over 200 inches in certain parts of the interior. The temperature rarely exceeds 90°; the usual daily range is between 76° and 86°.

History
The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the sixteenth century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the whole of the island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some parts of the Philippines. Towards the end of the sixteenth century its power began to decline, the outlying territories gradually fell away, and by the beginning of the nineteenth century the kingdom of Brunei had dwindled so as to include only what is now Sarawak and part of North Borneo.

At this period the town itself seems to have degenerated to the condition of a slave market for the sale of captives of Ilanun and Sulu pirates. Anarchy was rife in the outlying districts, and in 1841 Sarawak proper was ceded to Mr. (later Sir James) Brooke in return for his services in quelling an insurrection at Kuching, and he was declared Rajah of Sarawak. In 1846 the island of Labuan was ceded to Great Britain as a base for anti-piracy measures, and in 1877 the whole of the northern portion of Borneo was ceded to form the nucleus of what was to become British North Borneo. At various later dates further cessions were made to the Rajah of Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company till the territories of the State were eventually reduced to their present circumscribed limits.

In 1847 the Sultan entered into a Treaty with Great Britain for the furtherance of commercial relations and the mutual suppression of piracy. An additional clause provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction over British subjects in Brunei, which provision was modified by an Agreement of 1856.

By a further Treaty made in 1888 Brunei was placed under the protection of Great Britain, and the Sultan agreed that the foreign relations of the State should be conducted by Her Majesty's Government. Provision was also made for the setting up of Consular Courts with jurisdiction over British subjects and foreign subjects enjoying British protection. In 1905-06 a supplementary Agreement was entered into whereby the Sultan undertook to accept a British officer, to be styled Resident, who should be the agent and representative of the British Government under the High Commissioner for the Malay States (at that time the Governor of the Straits Settlements). The Governor of Sarawak has been High Commissioner for Brunei since 1948.

Constitution
The supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan in Council. The State Council consists of nineteen members, including the British Resident, with the Sultan as President. The assent of the Council is required for the enactment of legislation and important questions of policy are referred to it.

The general functions of administration are carried out by a British Resident under the supervision of the Governor of Sarawak as High
Commissioner. By a Treaty of 1906 the Resident's advice must be asked and acted upon in all questions other than those affecting the Mohammedan religion. The seat of Government is in Brunei Town and there are Assistant Residents at Kuala Belait and at Headquarters.

Land Policy

In the State a transfer charge, lease or sub-lease of land to a person who is not a natural born subject of the Sultan, or who has not resided in the State for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than seven years during the ten years immediately preceding the date on which such instrument is delivered to the Land Officer, shall be subject to, and shall not be valid or registered without, the approval of the Sultan in Council.

Taxation

At present there is no Income Tax upon persons other than Companies. Companies are taxed at the rate of 30% upon their chargeable income. Import, export and excise duties are charged. A royalty is paid by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company, based upon the amount of oil produced. A variety of licences are issued, mostly of a municipal nature.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 1,179,979   | 1,476,725       |
| 1953 | 98,976,643  | 22,646,697      |
| 1954 | 96,035,394  | 23,60,885       |
| 1955 | 104,104,343 | 28,768,753      |
| 1956 | 118,037,004 | 29,657,397      |
| 1957 | 130,954,281 | 39,401,515      |

In 1957 the main sources of revenue were:

- Customs: $4,415,896
- Income Tax: $57,461,707
- Mining Rents and Oil Royalties: $45,037,542

The main heads of expenditure in the same year were:

- Public Works Extraordinary: $23,722,565
- Miscellaneous services: $4,367,681
- Public Works Annually Recurrent: $6,203,735
- Medical and Health: $2,042,499

Currency

The State is a party to the Malayan Currency Agreement and Malayan currency is the only legal tender.

The standard coin is the Malayan silver dollar with a par of 2s. 4d., at which it is linked to sterling. Subsidiary coins are those of value of 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents. There is also copper coin of 1 cent. Currency notes are issued in different denominations from 50 cents upwards.

Development Plans

A sum of $100 million was set aside by the State Council in 1954 for development. Expenditure on the plan by the end of 1957 had reached $59,729,706. Progress with the plan has exceeded expectations and it is now confidently expected that the bulk of the work will be finished by the end of 1958, and virtually all by the end of 1959, i.e., within the five-year period.

A capital expenditure programme for the ensuing five years is under consideration. The main purpose of the State's first five-year Development Plan was to provide the basic services which are essential if agricultural or secondary industries are to flourish. At the beginning of the period the oilfield was not connected to the capital by road, communications were rudimentary, and power supplies totally inadequate.

By the end of 1957 a main trunk highway had been cut through to the oilfield although construction and surfacing were a long way from complete. Air services give daily connexions to Labuan, Singapore and thence to all parts of the world, and there is now a comprehensive network of V.H.F. link telephones. Electricity supplies are plentiful, and the only major facility now lacking is a good port. Ships of up to 1,700 tons only can use the wharf at Brunei Town some 16 miles from the sea.

Under the first five-year Development Plan two secondary schools, one for boys and one for girls, were built in Brunei Town, and a mixed secondary school was built at Seria to serve the Seria and Kuala Belait area. Some 24 primary schools have been built throughout the State, but still the pressure on school accommodation far exceeds supply. In particular, the demand for secondary school places is difficult to meet.

An Old Age Pension Scheme is in force in the State. There are also pensions for dependants of the blind, lepers, lunatics, tuberculosis patients and other persons undergoing protracted medical treatment.

The re-building of devastated areas was completed in 1954.

Education

The number and type of institutions providing educational facilities are:

(a) 48 Malay Vernacular Schools, with a total enrolment of 4,943; 3,451 boys and 1,492 girls. These schools are fully maintained by Government. The Malay language is the medium of instruction and English is taught as a second language in the Fourth Year in some schools.

(b) Chinese Schools, with an enrolment of 3,069; 1,730 boys and 1,339 girls. These schools receive 50% of recurrent costs from Government and building grants, the rest of their recurrent income is derived from subscriptions from the Chinese communities in the areas in which the schools are situated, and school fees. The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company, Limited, gives financial aid to the two Chinese Schools in the Oilfields area. The medium of instruction in all Chinese Schools is Mandarin. Malay is taught as a subject in all Chinese Schools. English is taught as a subject from the First Year.

(c) Schools in which the medium of instruction is English.

(i) Government Schools:-3 Secondary, 2 for Boys, 1 for Girls. All have preparatory departments.

(ii) Six Mission Schools:-3 Anglican, and three Roman Catholic. The Mission Schools are largely maintained by school fees and Mission funds. All receive grants-in-aid from Government and those situated in the Oil-
fields area receive financial aid from the Oil Company. One Mission School provides secondary education.

Enrolments are:

| Boys | Girls |
|------|-------|
| Government Secondary Schools (including Prep. Departments) | 529 | 185 |
| Mission Schools | 1,126 | 818 |

The total enrolment in all schools in 1957 was 11,260.

(d) One Trades School (Technical) is maintained by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company Limited, Government contributing 19% of the operating cost to finance an apprenticeship scheme. The present total enrolment is 146. The practical instruction given includes:—Fitting, Motor and Diesel Mechanics, Welding and Blacksmithing. On the theoretical side are included: Theory of Mechanics, Workshop practice, Electricity, Mathematics and Machine Drawing.

(e) There is one Teacher Training Centre which has an enrolment of 34 students. The medium of instruction is Malay, and English is taught as a subject.

Ninety-four Brunei students are attending educational institutions outside the State.

Recurrent expenditure on Education (both Government and other agencies) in 1957 was $3,755,384 compared with $36,059 in 1940 and $7,289 in 1930.

Non-recurrent expenditure in 1957 was $2,259,385, over 95% of this figure being spent on School Buildings and Equipment.

Health

With the increasing prosperity of the State and the gradual expansion of the Medical and Health Service, the standard of health in Brunei is improving. Serious under-nutrition is now rarely found except in the one to four year age group, but qualitative malnutrition, particularly due to protein and vitamin "A" deficiency is widely evident. In an attempt to counter this a school feeding scheme is now in operation. A school dental service has also been started.

Malaria has been reduced to negligible proportions, and the residual insecticide spraying of all the houses in the rural areas of the State has been completed for the first time during 1958.

A tuberculosis survey of the State is revealing a high incidence of the disease, but the number of early cases which have been treated and returned to work is encouraging. A scheme for the payment of allowances to the families of tuberculosis patients who are temporarily unable to work is proving of great value in encouraging sufferers to submit to treatment.

The maternal and child welfare services have been greatly expanded but the infant mortality rate remains high.

The Health Department is active in improving the hygiene and sanitation in the towns.

There is one 150-bed State Hospital in Brunei Town and a 75-bed District Hospital in Kuala Belait. The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company also runs a hospital (120 beds) in Kuala Belait for its oilfield employees. There are two district dispensaries, each with two small wards for in-patients, and a system of road and river travelling dispensaries.

Hospital attendances for 1957 were:

- In-patients: 3,812
- Out-patients: 105,339
- Maternal and Child Welfare Clinic attendances: 35,427
- Travelling dispensary attendances: 10,049

During 1957 the Medical Department budget amounted to $2,454,710, an increase of $371,774 over the previous year.

Communications

Brunei Airport is three miles from the centre of town and is used by Malayan Airways service running from Singapore to Kuching, Brunei, Labuan, Jesselton, Sandakan and reverse; and also by Borneo Airways aircraft which provide a feeder service to and from the many smaller aerodromes in Sarawak and North Borneo. Borneo Airways also provide a feeder service to overseas vessels at Labuan some 20 minutes away by air.

At present Malayan Airways are using Dakota aircraft, and Borneo Airways Twin Pioneer and Rapide aircraft. There is a daily service to and from Singapore either direct from Brunei airfield or through Labuan. The airfield is 4,900 feet long with 200-ft. over-runs at each end.

The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company have a private grass airfield 6,000 feet long at Anduki. This is used by their Prince aircraft to provide communication to the Malayan Airways service at Brunei Town or Labuan. There is also a light railway about eight miles long from the oilfield to Badas, the source of water for the oilfield, Kuala Belait, and Seria.

There are 279 miles of roads; bitumen surfaced 125 miles, metalled 8 miles, earth 71 miles, bridle paths 75 miles.

The main ports are Brunei Town and Kuala Belait. The bulk of general cargo for Brunei is transhipped from Singapore or Labuan and conveyed to the two main ports by coasting vessels run by the Straits Steamship Company. Weekly visits are made to the Port of Brunei Town direct from Singapore by this Company's vessels of up to 1,700 G.R.T. Cargo vessels, carrying mainly crushed granite and cement started operating direct from Hong Kong to Brunei in 1955 and by 1958 this became virtually a bi-weekly service. The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company also maintains a considerable fleet of vessels, and these ply mainly between Brunei Town, Labuan and Kuala Belait. In addition, numerous native-owned motor launches, tongkangs and outboard motor boats carry on a coastal trade around the Brunei and adjacent Colonies' ports. The State runs a motor launch service three times a week to Labuan, carrying mail and passengers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. Numbers employed in other occupations in 1957 were: Government service (Public Works) 2,290, oil mining 3,426, sawmilling and woodworking 308 and rubber 384.
Main Crops and Products

The main crops are padi, rubber and sago:

| Crop       | Tons |
|------------|------|
| Padi       | 2,796|
| Rubber     | 1,274|
| Sago       | 146  |
| Wild Rubber| 166  |

were produced in 1957.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle (including buffaloes) 13,400, pigs 5,400, poultry 110,500 and goats 950.

The production of crude oil from the Seria field by the Petroleum Company was 41,000,000 barrels in 1957.
