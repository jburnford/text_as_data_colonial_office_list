Geographical Features

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers, the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000-5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 726 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate

There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°-100°, but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.

History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. de Lacerda, who led an expedition to Chief Kasembe's capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in 1798. Though he died before reaching his goal, his diaries provide the first authoritative account of what is now north-eastern Rhodesia. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty's Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be, and on 17th October, 1900, the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika's dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed, and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company, but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company's administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation

of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company, and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April, 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

**Constitution**

The Protectorate is one of the three territories comprised in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 140). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, whose present membership is shown on page 147.

Under the terms of a new constitution coming into force early in 1959, the Governor will preside over an Executive Council of ten Ministers of whom only four will be officials (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Native Affairs); the six unofficial Ministers are to include two Africans. Each Minister, whether official or unofficial, will be responsible for a group of departments. The new Legislative Council to be constituted after the 1959 elections will contain a Speaker and 30 Members, of whom six will be officials and two will be nominated by the Governor. The remaining 22 Members are to be elected in single-member geographical constituencies on a two-tier qualitative franchise containing voters of all races. Two of the seats must, however, be filled by Africans, and two others by Europeans; in the elections to the two reserved European seats and those to 12 of the remaining seats (those representing the main areas of European settlement) the weight to be accorded to votes cast by voters on the lower tier of the franchise is limited to one-third of the votes actually cast by voters on the higher tier. The main features of the new constitution are that all elected Members of the Legislative Council will be returned by and become responsible to a multi-racial electorate; each qualified voter may vote twice, once for a Member in a reserved seat and once for another Member, and at least one of his two votes will always count in full. In the Executive Council there will be for the first time a majority of unofficial Ministers.

**Land Policy**

Land is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land in a municipality is alienated by Head Lease to the Local Authority which in turn sub-lets to an approved applicant. Crown Land in a township is alienated by direct lease from the Crown but subject to the recommendation of the Local Authority. Crown Land for agricultural purposes is alienated on leasehold tenure by the Agricultural Lands Board which insists on certain standards of finance and farming skill. An Agricultural Lands Ordinance has now been enacted making it possible for the lessee of agricultural land to obtain conditional freehold title to his farm on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down by the Ordinance. There is in certain areas freehold land held by private persons to which title was obtained in the early days.

**Taxation**

The Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of income tax and customs and excise duties on the 1st April, 1954.

Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 10s. and £1 per annum. There are, in addition, certain levies generally varying between 2s. and 13s. 6d. per annum made by Native Authorities.

**Public Finance**

The establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the 23rd October 1953 resulted in considerable changes in the Territory's financial responsibilities and arrangements. To conform with the Federal Government's financial year, which runs from the 1st July to the 30th June, the Territory's accounts were not closed on the 31st December 1953, the financial period being extended to the 30th June 1954.

The Territory retained its full revenue and met its full recurrent expenditure up to the 31st December 1953. For the six months period ended the 30th June 1954, revenue to which the Federal Government had become entitled was collected on behalf of that Government and paid over, except that the Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of Income Tax and Customs and Excise Duties on the 1st April 1954. With effect from the 1st January 1954 the Federal Government assumed full financial responsibility for the Departments which it was due to take over, and refunded to the Northern Rhodesia Government the full cost of administering them. The figures in the following table relating to the first six months of 1954 are not, therefore, comparable with those in preceding years, as both revenue and expenditure totals include figures resulting from the settlements between the two Governments. The principal Departments and services taken over by the Federal Government in 1954 were as follows:

- Audit
- Civil Aviation
- Military
- Prisons
- Customs
- Income Tax
- Posts and Telegraphs
- European Education
- Health.

European Agriculture was taken over by the Federal Government from the 1st January, 1956. Broadcasting, which was formerly a responsibility of the Information Department, was transferred to the control of the Federal Broadcasting Corporation on the 1st February, 1958.

The main sources of revenue are now the payment received from the Federal Government representing 18% of the collections within the Federation on account of taxes on income, and the Territorial surcharge on Company Income Tax assessments also collected by the Federal Government on behalf of the Northern Rhodesia Government. These two taxes represent 62.5% of the estimated revenue for 1957-58, and a further 9.6% is derived from mineral royalties. The Northern Rhodesian Government no longer...
collects Customs and Excise duties. These are levied by the Federal Government, and not shared with the other Territories of the Federation.

Currency

Up to the 23rd April, 1957, the currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The denominations were 10s., £1, £5 and £10 notes, cupro-nickel or copper halfpennies and pennies and cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns.

On the 23rd April, 1957, however, the Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which took over the assets of the Central Africa Currency Board on the 1st April, 1956, commenced the issue of new currency notes of the denominations of 10s., £1, £5 and £10. The two types of currency now circulate together, but the new will gradually replace the old as the latter becomes unfit for circulation. As from the 1st January, 1955, British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Development Plans

The Northern Rhodesia Territorial Government's Development Plan is estimated to cost £35,478,312 during the four-year period ending the 30th June, 1961. Expenditure will be met from the Capital Fund and is allocated as follows:

| Category                                      | Amount (£) |

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

At 30th June, 1958, there were 53 Government European schools, two Government-aided and eight private schools providing education for European children. Nine of the Government schools and one private school provided education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard. Post-Certificate education up to the Cambridge Higher Certificate is provided at five of the Government Secondary Schools. There were 13 Government hostels housing 830 children.

The enrolment in European Government schools was 13,381; in Government-aided and private schools, 2,001. Technical education for apprentices is provided by the Copperbelt Technical Foundation at Kitwe, Luanshya, Mufulira and Chingola and by the Federal Government at Ndola, Broken Hill, Lusaka and Livingstone. The Foundation operates under the aegis of the mines with assistance from the Ministry of Education. Government assistance in the form of bursaries, loans, scholarships and grants is available under certain conditions for higher education.

Pupils from Northern Rhodesia may now attend the Training College for European teachers at Heany, near Bulawayo, and the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland at Salisbury.

There are 12 Government schools for Asians (1,343 children) and three for Coloureds (264). There is a Government hostel for 94 Coloureds and a Government-aided school accommodating 150 Coloured children (149 boarders).

Of approximately 530,000 African children of school age some 235,855 were in the following schools in September 1957:

| African Schools                          | No. of schools | No. of pupils, etc. |
|------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools      | 1,451          | 227,296             |
| Unaided primary schools                  | 35             | 3,767               |
| Secondary schools                        | 17             | 1,600               |
| Teacher training schools                 | 15             | 1,306               |
| Trades schools                           | 21             | 1,467               |
| Other vocational schools (girls)         | 20             | 419                 |

There were two post-secondary Courses in operation (with some 80 pupils) namely a Sixth Form at Munali Secondary School and a course for the training of upper primary school teachers at Chalimbana Training College. Bursaries are awarded both by the Federal Government and Northern Rhodesia Government for students to attend various courses of higher education. In September 1957, there were 41 such students both in Africa and in the United Kingdom.

Recurrent expenditure on African education is given below.

| African Education | £            |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 1938              | 32,740       |
| 1945              | 149,450      |
| 1953              | 642,834      |
| 1954              | 853,822      |
| 1955              | 1,054,674    |
| 1956              | 1,717,158*   |
| 1957              | 1,699,816    |

* Includes £460,000 for starting the Unified African Teaching Service pension scheme.

Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.

The Institute, with headquarters at Lusaka, has conducted social research in British Central Africa since 1938. Emphasis is placed on the study of the reaction of African peoples to modern social and economic conditions, and of their contacts with the immigrant races.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia's National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times. The Library contains approximately 4,000 volumes which are available to members of the Northern Rhodesia Society.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

Public health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.
There are twelve Government European hospitals in the Territory. During 1957, 9,175 patients were admitted. The principal causes of admission were heart diseases, violence (including all accidents), nervous diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, malaria and colitic complaints.

The 15 Government African hospitals dealt with 65,076 admissions in 1957.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above, there are 134 rural health centres, and it is expected that a large Combined General Hospital for Europeans and Africans at Kitwe, and a Cottage Hospital for Europeans, Coloureds and Asians at Luanshya, will be in operation in 1959.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and certain other aspects of communications.

There is an international airport at Livingstone and national airports at Lusaka, Ndola and Kasama, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. Subsidiary airfields serve most of the outlying districts, but less than half are of all-weather construction.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo border (near Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 655 miles.

The total mileage of maintained roads in the Territory is now 22,210, made up as follows:

| Roads Type          | Miles   |
|---------------------|---------|
| Main roads          | 4,963   |
| District and Branch roads | 11,038 |
| Ungazetted tracks   | 1,666   |
| Town roads          | 154     |
| Rural roads         | 4,389   |

*Excluding those maintained by municipalities.

There are 545 miles of main roads of Class 1 (bituminous surface) standard. This total includes roads maintained by the Public Works Department through townships, and also roads completed but still maintained by contractors.

The Zambezi River Transport Service Board of Control operates a passenger and goods service along the Zambezi River from Livingstone to Mongu. The first portion of the route is by road to Mambova on the Zambezi River from which point power barges operate to Katima Mulilo. The remainder of the route is covered by road vehicles running on roads in close proximity to the river. During 1957 the service carried 5,815 tons of goods traffic and 16,369 passengers.

Broadcasting

The Central African Broadcasting Service, previously administered by the Northern Rhodesia Government Information Department, became a statutory corporation on 1st February, 1958.

The major studios and all the transmitters serving the African Service of the Federal Broadcasting Corporation are situated in Lusaka. Programmes are transmitted on two channels daily.

The total hours broadcast for Africans per week is 88.

The broadcasts are transmitted in eight vernaculars and English: Nyanja, Bemba, Tonga, Lozi, Lunda and Luvale for Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Shona and Sindebele for Southern Rhodesia. English is the medium for three hours each weekday and for eight hours each Sunday.

It is estimated that 100,000 Africans in the three territories own wireless sets and that at peak listening hours some 400,000 Africans tune to Lusaka. A wired broadcast service is installed in a Lusaka location and is controlled by the Federal Broadcasting Corporation.

Main Crops and Products
The main crops are maize and tobacco. Groundnut production is increasing. Small quantities of rice, cotton, pulses, citrus, potatoes, tropical fruits, vegetables, wheat and beeswax are also produced.

| Main Crops—Production | 1955 | 1956 | 1957 |
|-----------------------|------|------|------|
| Maize—000 tons        | 103·5| 143·9| 207·6|
| Groundnuts—000 tons   | 5·5  | 6·5  | 8·5  |

In 1957 the approximate number of cattle owned by Europeans was 155,000. African owned livestock totalled 891,566 cattle, 176,438 sheep and goats and 44,181 pigs. Over 36,000 head of cattle were slaughtered during the year.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru, and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is cured and marketed in the urban areas.

Output of sawlogs, poles, and firewood amounted to 501,053 tons in 1957.

Mineral Production in 1957

| Mineral Product | Quantity Approximate Value £000 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| Copper (electrolytic) 000 tons | 247 54,416 |

| Limestone 000 tons              | 449 376 |

Also produced are tin, manganese, silver, gold, iron ore, selenium, beryl, mica, cadmium and uranium oxide.

A very large variety of products is now being manufactured in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, steel finishing work, tiles, furniture, clothing, beer, mineral waters, soap and oils, metal castings and nuts and bolts.

Trade
During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of imports and exports and no separate figures for Northern Rhodesia are available.

* Excludes Western area flue cured Virginia tobacco which is sold unidentified on the Salisbury auction floors.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations
There was a rapid expansion of the African agricultural producer movement during 1957, and 36 new societies were registered.

The total number of societies registered at the 31st December, 1957, was 201, with a European and African aggregate membership of 27,222. Paid-up share capital and deposits amounted to £478,279. Combined turnover of all societies amounted to £7,370,022.

The principal products handled were maize, wheat, beans, cowpeas, sunhemp, kaffir corn, millet, cassava, groundnuts, rice, potatoes, fruit, vegetables, cotton, Virginia, Burley and Turkish tobacco, milk, cream and fish.

Thrift societies are becoming of increasing importance in the urban areas, membership during the year having increased by over 30% and deposits by over 50%.

Consumer societies continue to give a useful service to Africans in a limited number of areas, and most agricultural producer societies provide essential consumer goods especially agricultural requirements.
