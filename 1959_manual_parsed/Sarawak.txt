SARAWAK

Area

The area of the Colony is approximately 47,500 square miles.

Population

The estimate at 31st December, 1956, was 631,431. The following are the estimates for the various groups:

| Group                  | Estimate |
|------------------------|----------|
| Sea Dayak (or Iban)    | 197,945  |
| Chinese                | 189,826  |

| Other indigenous       | 30,541   |
| Other non-indigenous   | 8,525    |

Principal Towns

| Town          | Approximate Population |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Kuching (capital) | 58,000                 |

Miri was almost entirely destroyed as a result of the war but reconstruction has now been completed.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of a coastal strip some 450 miles long and varying from 40 to 120 miles wide on the north-west coast of the island of Borneo. A broken range of mountains runs south-west through the middle of the island, and Sarawak lies between this range and the sea. The southern border with West, or Indonesian, Borneo, is formed by another range of mountains running westerly from about the centre of the main range. The country is divided into three main zones. Firstly, an alluvial and swampy coastal plain in which isolated mountains and mountain groups rise to 2,000 feet or more, then rolling country of yellow sandy clay intersected by ranges of mountains, and finally a mountainous area in the interior. The highest peak is Murud, 7,950 feet. The Rejang (350 miles long) and Sarawak Rivers are navigable for ocean-going ships for 170 and 22 miles respectively. Others are navigable by coastal steamers or launches. Most of the rivers have shallow bars which limit the size of the vessels entering. On the Trusum, Limbang, Baram and Rejang Rivers, gorges and dangerous rapids occur well below the sources. Lowland tropical rain forest covers approximately 34,000 square miles, or 72% of the land area of the Colony. Much of this forest is inaccessible until the internal communications of the country can be improved.
Climate

The climate is humid, day temperatures averaging 85°. October to March is the season of the northeast monsoon, with the heaviest rains, strong winds and high seas. Except for a transitional month, the remainder of the year has less rainfall, with occasional droughts lasting up to three weeks. In the coastal area from Miri to Labuan most of the rainfall is between midnight and dawn. The average annual rainfall varies from 100 to 180 inches.

History

The history of Sarawak as an integral State begins with the first landing of James Brooke in 1839. At that time Sarawak was the southern province of the Brunei Sultanate. The oppression of the Sultan's viceroy, Makota, had goaded Malays and Land Dayaks into revolt. James Brooke interceded in the dispute, brought about a settlement and was rewarded for his services by being installed in 1841 as Rajah of the territory from Cape Datu to the Samarahan River. Thereafter Rajah Brooke devoted himself to the suppression of piracy and head-hunting, often with the assistance of ships of the Royal Navy, which performed almost incredible feats of navigation and endurance. Sarawak was recognized as an independent State by the United States of America in 1850, and by Great Britain in 1864. In 1861 the territory of Sarawak was enlarged by the Sultan's cession of all rivers and lands from the Sadong River to Kidurong Point.

At his death in 1868, Sir James Brooke bequeathed to his nephew and successor, Charles Brooke, a country paternally governed, with a solid foundation of mutual trust and affection between ruler and ruled. In 1882 the frontier was advanced beyond the Baram River. In 1885 the valley of the Trusun River was ceded and in 1890 the Limbang River was annexed at the request of the inhabitants. In 1905 the Lawas River area was purchased from the British North Borneo Company, with the consent of the British Government. British protection was accorded to Sarawak in 1888.

The third Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, succeeded his father in 1917, and progress continued in all spheres. In 1941, the centenary year of Brooke rule, the State was in a sound economic position with large reserves. To celebrate the centenary, the Rajah enacted a new constitution, and set his people on the first stage of the road to democratic self-government.

During the Japanese occupation, social services and communications were neglected; education ceased; health precautions were ignored; sickness and malnutrition spread throughout the State. After the surrender of Japan, the Australian forces entered Kuching on the 11th September, 1945, and Sarawak was for seven months administered by a British Military Administration, as a result of whose efforts supplies of essential commodities were distributed, the constabulary re-formed and the medical and educational services reorganized. The Rajah resumed the administration of the State on the 15th April, 1946. It was however, evident to him that greater resources and more technical and scientific experience were needed to restore to Sarawak her former prosperity. He therefore decided to hand the country over to the British Crown, and a Bill to this effect was introduced into the Council Negri in May 1946 and passed by a small majority. By an Order in Council the State became a British Colony on the 1st July, 1946.

Constitution

A new Constitution was granted to Sarawak by the Sarawak (Constitution) Orders in Council, 1956, which were brought into force in 1957. Under this Constitution the Council Negri (i.e. the legislature) consists of twenty-four Elected Members, not more than fourteen ex officio Members, four Nominated Members and two Standing Members (who were appointed for life by His Highness the Rajah before Cession). The Supreme Council (i.e. the Executive Council) consists of five Elected Members (elected by the Elected Members of the Council Negri from amongst its Elected, Nominated and Standing Members by secret ballot), three ex officio Members and two Nominated Members. The Council Negri Elections Ordinance, 1956, provides for Electoral Colleges and Sub-Electoral Colleges. The Electoral Colleges are the five Divisional Advisory Councils, the Kuching Municipal Council, the Sibu Urban District Council and the Miri Urban District Council.

The new Constitution replaces the Constitution granted by His Highness the Rajah in 1941, as amended by the Sarawak Letters Patent, 1946.

Land Policy

All the land in the Colony is classified under one of the following headings: mixed zones; native areas; native customary lands; interior areas; or reserved lands. Alienation to non-natives is permitted only in mixed zones which the Director of Lands and Surveys may create from time to time in areas of not more than 500 acres: any area in excess of 500 acres requires the approval of the Governor in Council. In native areas only natives of Sarawak may obtain rights to land. The interior areas consist mostly of virgin jungle and any land occupied there consists entirely of native farming lands lying away from the main centres of trade and plantation industry and only general administrative control is exercised. Land may be alienated in large or small holdings, but small holdings predominate and the policy is one of encouragement for the smallholder to own his land. During 1954 legislation was introduced to restrict severely the indiscriminate felling of virgin jungle. Schemes for land development on a large scale are being introduced.

The Land Code, 1957, was enacted with effect from the 1st January 1958. This Code combined and revised all previous legislation pertaining to land, except the Land (Control of Subdivision) Ordinance, 1954.

Taxation

The only direct taxes levied on the native population by Government are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year, and the Malay "head tax" of $1 per year which is levied on all males of working age. These taxes are transferred to local authorities, where existent, who may in certain circumstances levy a cess of a similar amount on other indigenous races.

Income tax at the rate of 30% on every $ of the chargeable income is levied on every company incorporated or registered under any law or charter in force in Sarawak or elsewhere. There is no personal income tax at present.
Public Finance

| Year | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1938 | $4,261,899 | $4,272,140  |
| 1953 | $43,688,312| $34,280,449 |
| 1954 | $43,800,621| $33,264,706 |
| 1955 | $49,774,861| $34,431,606 |
| 1956 | $51,434,042| $43,374,437 |
| 1957 | $52,163,917| $50,587,351 |

The main heads of revenue and expenditure in 1957 were:
- Revenue derived from Customs import and export duties $25,387,678; Licences, Taxes and Internal Revenue $3,514,897; Interest on Investments etc. $2,998,604; Income Tax $8,504,248;
- Expenditure — Contribution to Development Fund $3,000,000; Constabulary $3,879,412; Education $7,194,015; Medical $5,133,278; Administration $2,628,419; Lands and Surveys $2,064,682; Public Works $5,260,209; Public Works Non-Recurrent $2,156,877.

The Colony has no public debt.

Currency

The legal tender of Sarawak is currency issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. By virtue of the Currency Ordinance, 1951, and Proclamation of November, 1952, Sarawak currency ceased to be legal tender with effect from 31st December, 1952. These notes and coins may be exchanged, as a matter of grace, for an equivalent amount of currency issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, at any Sarawak Government Treasury.

The value of the Malayan dollar is 2s. 4d. sterling.

Development Plans

A further review of the 1955–60 Development Plan was undertaken during 1957, and the expenditure during the period 1957–60 is expected to be $105,640,000 (£12,325,500). The Plan is to be financed by Colonial Development and Welfare grants, local revenue appropriations, accumulated surplus balances and loan funds. The total provision is divided as follows:

- Agriculture: $10,986,897
- Forestry: $208,449
- Fisheries: $222,107
- Communications: $41,770,500
- Fuel and Power: $4,000,000
- Education: $15,683,111
- Medical and Health: $11,483,185
- Miscellaneous: $21,285,198

The provision for Communications accounts for nearly 40% of the Plan during this period and is to be spent on roads, port development, aviation, waterways and telecommunications. Miscellaneous schemes include provision of $8,000,000 for low cost housing and home-ownership schemes.

Other Development

Industrial development is mainly in the hands of private enterprise, notably the oil industry. A pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Ordinance has been enacted to encourage the establishment and development of new industries. A Development Finance Corporation is to be set up to assist local enterprise. The Government has also spent a total of $129 million since 1947 on reconstruction and development.

Education

At the end of 1957 there were 712 schools in Sarawak, of which 36 provided secondary education. The number of children in school, which in 1947 was 29,616, had risen in 1957 to 79,407, of whom 71,414 were at the primary stage and 7,993 at the secondary stage. Of the total enrolment, 51,358 were Chinese pupils. Schools are under the management of Government, Local Authorities, Christian Missions, Committees of Management of Chinese Schools, and Village School Committees. There were 98 students studying overseas under various scholarship schemes. Teacher-training is carried on at Batu Lintang, near Kuching, at a residential centre run by Government in co-operation with the missions, and at Sibu in the Third Division. Expansion of educational services in the post-war years was largely made possible by the encouragement of “self-help” methods on the part of local communities, particularly with regard to the provision and maintenance of primary school buildings and furniture. As from 1st January, 1956, the central government assumed much greater financial responsibility for education. Under a new system of grants-in-aid, for which all schools under local authorities and voluntary agencies are eligible, approved recurrent expenditure in aided schools, after deducting revenue from fees at prescribed rates, is now met entirely from public funds. For approved capital expenditure, up to 50% of the cost may normally be met from public funds. The introduction of the new grants, coupled with the big rise in school enrolments and improvements in the terms of service of teachers, led to an increase in public expenditure on education from £1,576,000 (equivalent to £184,000) in 1955 to £9,172,615 (£1,070,139) in 1957, all of which was met from Sarawak funds.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Sarawak Museum, at Kuching, is the only one in Borneo. Its research activities are largely concerned with the anthropology and ethnology of the country. Archaeological excavations are also in progress. The Reference Library is housed in the Museum buildings; there are also a lending library and reading room at Kuching and Sibu.

Health

Health and sanitation are good in the towns and in rural areas are improving very rapidly. A country-wide malaria eradication scheme is in operation and although there is still some malaria in certain places, this disease will soon be nonexistent in the country.

Beds available at Sarawak hospitals total about 817 including 224 mental. A large new mental hospital has been built near Kuching, also considerable extensions to the hospital at Sibu.

Outside the main centres there are many static and travelling dispensaries. A typical static dispensary is in charge of a senior hospital assistant, and, as well as attending to very large numbers of out-patients, has about half a dozen “rest beds” for in-patients. A travelling dispensary is a small outboard motor-boat which travels on a more or less fixed itinerary along a river.

Maternity and child welfare services throughout the country are well advanced and in the town of Kuching, most births are attended in homes or hospitals by members of the Government medical department.
The expenditure of the Medical Department for the year 1957 was $5,133,278 for ordinary annual purposes and $2,422,016 from the development account for special work such as new building and the malaria eradication project.

Communications

There are two main airports, at Kuching and Sibu. Small feeder service airstrips are at Bintulu, Lutong, Sematan, Simanggang, Mukah, Marudi and Lawas. Malayan Airways Limited operate ten services weekly in each direction between Singapore, Kuching and Sibu. Most of these services operate to Brunei and North Borneo centres.

Borneo Airways operate an internal service with Twin Pioneers, linking up with the main line service. Cathay Pacific Airways operate a weekly service to Kuching from Hong Kong via Labuan.

The sea and rivers remain the chief means of surface communication, although development of internal air services has recently been a feature of some importance. Work is progressing on various new road projects.

The total road mileage is about 557, consisting of 123 miles bitumen surfaced, 97 miles gravel surface and 337 miles dry-weather earth roads and tracks.

The Sarawak Steamship Company's coastal service has been withdrawn, with the exception of their regular service Kuching to Sibu by M.V. Rejang. M.V. Rajah Brooke and M.V. Auby provide a weekly passenger and cargo service between Kuching and Singapore and there is a further regular connection between Sibu and Kuching by vessels of this company. Ships of the Rejang United Steamship Company also serve Kuching and Rejang River ports. Various local shipping companies, mainly Chinese, ply up and down the main rivers and between coastal ports on limited voyages with a variety of launches and small, timber-built, powered craft carrying passengers and cargo. The Norwegian vessels Hervar and Henrik owned by the China Siam Line now provide a fortnightly service between Kuching, Sibu, Miri and Hong Kong mostly via British North Borneo ports. Rice, maize, pickled vegetables and salt are brought in about once every three weeks by ship from Bangkok to both Kuching and Rejang River ports. Bulk oil depots have been established at both Kuching and Sibu and installations are managed by Shell and Stanvac at each port. Tankers of up to 360 ft. long are used to supply Kuching and up to 214 ft. for Sibu.

Miri remains a fairly large oil exporting port and Tanjong Mani, in the Rejang river, exports timber to the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and Hong Kong by vessels of various lines.

The number and tonnage of overseas and neighbouring territories vessels calling at Sarawak ports (including vessels calling for timber, and oil tankers) in 1957 were: arrivals 3,619, tonnage 3,876,947; departures 3,615, tonnage 3,847,420 (whole Colony).

Broadcasting

The Government broadcasting service (Radio Sarawak) was inaugurated on 7th June, 1954, and broadcasts in English, Malay, Chinese and Iban for approximately 14 hours daily, on two short wave transmissions (7½ kW. and 5 kW.) and on one medium wave transmission (5 kW.). Studios, programme and administrative offices are at Broadcasting House in central Kuching. The transmitting station is about 1½ miles, and the receiving station 4½ miles, away. High quality medium wave coverage is given within a radius of 35 miles of Kuching and short wave reception is clear throughout Borneo and in other neighbouring countries in South-East Asia. About 25,000 licences are held.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population are engaged in agricultural pursuits; the indigenous tribes are almost all padi farmers but also frequently cultivate small rubber or sago plantations and collect jungle produce such as rattan, jelutong and damar (resin). The Chinese agriculturists rely on rubber and pepper. Malays and Melanau are largely employed in sago and timber, whilst Ibans, when not busy on their padi farms, are employed as log extractors in the forest, on road work or as unskilled labour in the oilfields. Numbers employed in the principal industries are:

| Industry                  | Number |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Sawmills                  | 5,952  |
| Oilfields                 | 1,457  |
| Rubber Estates (excluding smallholders) | 1,003 |
| Cutch                     | 61     |
| Jelutong                  | 65     |
| Road and Building Construction | 1,100 |
| Mining and quarrying      | 316    |
| Bauxite mining            | 199    |
| Gold mining               | 106    |

Thirty-two trade unions, with a total membership of 6,827, have been registered.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural export products are rubber, sago and pepper. Padi, tapioca, maize, coffee, fruit and vegetables are grown for local consumption. (Local padi production is inadequate to meet local demands for rice, the staple diet, and there are considerable imports of rice.)

Animal husbandry plays only a small part at present in the rural economy. Pigs are kept by the Chinese and Dayaks and this aspect is developing. There are some cattle and buffaloes but they are mainly confined to the north.

Both marine and freshwater fisheries are of considerable importance, but production is inadequate to meet local needs and there are considerable imports of dried, salted and tinned fish.

The Colony's mineral products are oil, gold, coal, antimony, mercury, diamonds, limestone, clay used for bricks and tiles, building stone and phosphate. Oil and gold have received the closest examination but, in common with the other minerals, a large amount of work remains to be carried out before their potentials are known.

The only major industry is the refining of oil. There are many small factories processing rural products scattered throughout the more accessible parts of the country—particularly padi mills and rubber smokehouses; sago factories are mainly confined to the sago-growing areas. There are 58 licensed sawmills, a cutch factory, a vegetable oil factory, a jelutong refinery, and three distilleries using the products of the nipah palm; all these are privately owned.

Principal Exports by Quantity and Value

| Export       | 1938 | 1956 | 1957 |
|--------------|------|------|------|
| Rubber       | tons | 17,988 | 41,234 | 41,000 |

| Mineral Oil(a) | tons | 897 | 5,579 | 5,477 |

(a) Crude oil is piped to the refinery in Sarawak from the adjoining territory of Brunei, and constitutes most of the output. Crude oil from wells in Sarawak (65,906 tons in 1957 and 70,616 tons in 1956) is also treated at the same refinery and both crude and refined petroleums are included in the total exports.

In 1957 41·6% of domestic exports went to Singapore; 6·3% to the United Kingdom; 21·3% to other Commonwealth countries and 30·8% to other countries. In the same year 69·1% of imports originated in Brunei (crude oil for refining and subsequent re-export); 8·5% in the United Kingdom; 8·0% in other Commonwealth countries; and 14·4% in other countries.

The chief imports, other than oil from Brunei, are foodstuffs, textiles, tobacco, beverages, and manufactured goods.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are no marketing boards or statutory marketing organizations. Government provides facilities for the purchase of padi at a fixed floor price at a number of points scattered throughout the country. Control over the standard grading of sago and pepper for export is also exercised by Government.

Co-operative development was started in 1949 and has made steady progress. By 20th August, 1958, there were 164 co-operative societies on the Register engaged in the following business:

- Marketing (Vegetables and Fish) 4;
- Padi Saving 46;
- Padi Milling 24;
- Consumers Stores 23;
- Credit and Savings 62;
- Miscellaneous 3;
- Secondary (including Bank) 2.

These societies were distributed through all Divisions except the Fifth and were composed of Malays, Melanaus, Land Dayaks, Sea Dayaks, Kenyahs, Kayans and Chinese.
