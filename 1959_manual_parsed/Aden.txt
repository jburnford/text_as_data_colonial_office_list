ADEN COLONY

Area

Aden Colony is situated about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia. The area is 75 square miles (exclusive of Perim and the Kuria Muria Islands, the areas of which are 5 square miles and 28 square miles respectively).

Population

At the census taken in 1955 the total population recorded was 138,441:

| Population       | Per cent. |

Principal Towns

| Town                          | Population |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| Aden (including Tawahi, Maala, Crater, Khormaksar) | 99,285     |
| Sheikh Othman                | 29,879     |
| Little Aden                  | 9,277      |

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas, joined by a flat sandy foreshore, comprising:

(a) The peninsula on which are situated the main town known as Crater, the wharf and shipyard area of Maala, the modern harbour suburb known as Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased to the Air Ministry for R.A.F. and military purposes and known collectively as Steamer Point.

(b) The isthmus known as Khormaksar where a large R.A.F. station is situated.

(c) The strip of mainland between the two peninsulas which encloses the modern harbour and contains the township of Sheikh Othman and the villages of Hiswa and Imad.

(d) The Little Aden peninsula where a modern refinery has been constructed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited and where the two fishing villages of Bureika and Fukum lie.

The Island of Perim, and the Kuria Muria Islands off the Dhufar Coast of Oman, also form part of the Colony.

Climate

The climate is not unhealthy, though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent, but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

History

The plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden led to the capture of Aden by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company in 1839 under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy.

The need to establish coaling stations on trade routes because of the replacement of sailing ships by steamers was one of the reasons which led to the occupation of Aden by the British. Little Aden was obtained by purchase in 1868. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the Island the same year. It was later re-occupied by the British in January 1857.

The five Kuria Muria Islands were ceded to the United Kingdom in 1854 by the Sultan of Oman for purposes of a cable station.

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden from 1st April, 1937.

Constitution

By Additional Royal Instructions issued in November 1958, the following changes in the composition of the Executive Council of the Colony have become effective:

The Executive Council now consists of five ex officio members (who must include the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, and a representative of the Senior Officer of the Forces stationed in the Colony), and also "five persons who are Elected Members or Nominated Members of the Legislative Council, but not less than three of whom shall be Elected Members, selected and appointed by the Governor... who shall be styled Members in Charge". There is provision for the Governor to assign to individual Members in Charge responsibility for matters which he may prescribe at his discretion. Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, a Legislative Council was constituted consisting of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than four official members and not more than eight unofficial members. The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1955, provided for the introduction of an elected element into the Legislative Council. Under this Order the Council consisted of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than five nominated official members, not more than five nominated unofficial members, and four elected members.

The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1958, provided for a Legislative Council consisting of a Speaker, five ex officio members, twelve elected members, and six nominated members. The first elections under the provisions of this Order took place on 4th January, 1959.

Land Policy

Under the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1945, the Governor is empowered to lease or otherwise alienate in Her Majesty's behalf any Crown Land for building, agricultural or any other purpose, on any terms and conditions, as he may think fit.

Taxation

Aden is a free port and there is no general Customs tariff, but taxes are levied on alcoholic liquor, tobacco and motor spirit. The Income Tax Ordinance provides for the payment of a graduated tax by individuals ranging from 4 per cent. to 75 per cent. on chargeable income. Companies pay at the rate of 37½ per cent., but this was reduced to 32½ per cent. with effect from the year of assessment commencing on 1st April, 1956.

In 1957-58 £899,363 of revenue was derived from Income Tax and £715,813 from Customs and Excise. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: £688,795
- Public Works: £733,602
- Development Fund: £1,766,160
- Capital Works at Little Aden: £207,731

Currency

The currency in circulation is the East African currency issued by the East African Currency Board. It is issued in denominations of 100 Sh., 20 Sh., 10 Sh., and 5 Sh. notes and 1 Sh., 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent coins.

Development Plans

During 1956 a new Development Plan to cover the period 1955-60 was approved. The previous five-year programme was regarded as terminated after three years on 31st March 1955 and the balance of unfinished projects was carried forward to the new Plan. Some new projects were also included in the 1955-60 Plan, the total revised estimated cost of which is £7,681,000 made up as follows:

- Social Services: £2,270,460
- Communications: £966,442
- Public Utilities: £2,471,500
- Housing: £1,684,000
- Miscellaneous: £1,929,250

Among the projects are a new hospital costing £1,538,000, a housing scheme £1,050,000, land reclamation work £500,000, water supply improvements £826,000 and school buildings £380,000.

The Plan is being financed through a Development Fund which obtains its resources by transfers from general revenue, loans and Colonial Development and Welfare grants. The latter consist of £194,000 carried forward from the previous programme and £100,000 allocated under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1955. Between 1947 and 1955 expenditure on development works amounted to £2,961,000 of which £1,869,000 was found from taxation, surplus balances and local subscriptions to loans. On the works to be executed under the current programme at least half the expenditure will be met by funds provided within the Colony.

In addition to the development works mentioned above, capital township works costing £4,000,000 have almost been completed at Little Aden where a new oil refinery is sited. This expenditure is being financed by a loan from Her Majesty's Government and will be repaid over a period of 30 years.

Education in Aden is under the control of a Director, who also advises in both the Eastern and Western Protectorates. On 1st October, 1957, there were in the Colony 3,624 pupils (3,955 boys and 1,669 girls) in Government schools, 3,443 (2,152 boys and 1,291 girls) in grant-aided schools, and some 2,737 pupils (2,604 boys and 133 girls) in recognized private schools. In addition there are numerous unrecognized groups of children attending Koranic schools. The educational system consists of four years of primary, three years of intermediate and six years of secondary schooling. Secondary education is almost entirely in the hands of Government, which has provided three fine colleges for this purpose: Aden College, which prepares boys for the examinations of the London University General Certificate of Education at ordinary and advanced levels; the Technical Institute, where courses in carpentry and joinery, machine-shop engineering, automobile engineering and electrical engineering are given—leading to the City and Guilds of London Institute examinations—as well as clerical training courses; and the Girls' College, which was opened in its new premises in 1956 and replaced the former Girls' Intermediate School. In this College all the pupils receive an education up to intermediate level. Selected girls who complete the intermediate course successfully then pass on to the secondary section at the College. The Teacher Training Centre offers a one-year course of training for newly recruited teachers as well as teachers already in service. Provision is also made for training teachers from the Aden Protectorates. There is also a Teacher Training Centre for women.

The Technical Institute offers courses in various technical subjects both at Aden and at Little Aden. Adult evening classes in academic subjects are also provided by the Education Department.

There are at present 40 men and women on scholarships in the United Kingdom.

The expenditure on Colony education has risen from £6,600 in 1936 to £383,994 in 1958-59. During this period some £119,540 was spent on capital works.

Libraries

The Lake Library, administered by the Municipality, contains 14,216 books in English, Arabic, Urdu and Hebrew and has about 778 members. There are also well-stocked and expanding libraries at Aden College and the Technical Institute. Amenities for the teaching profession include a club with a library of over 2,000 volumes.

Health

The principal causes of ill-health and disability in Aden fall under the following headings: Respiratory Diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia; Road Accidents; Gastro-intestinal disturbances.

The following hospital beds are available:

- Queen Elizabeth (Civil) Hospital: 495 beds
- Maternity Clinic: 60 beds, 43 cots
- Infectious Diseases Hospital: 56 beds
- Keith Falconer Mission Hospital (Church of Scotland): 73 beds, 3 private rooms, 8 cots

In 1957 in-patients and out-patients at the Civil Hospital totalled 5,611 and 213,539, respectively. There are six Government dispensaries including two seamen's dispensaries, at which attendances totalled 210,779, and two charitable dispensaries at which 200,807 patients were seen.
Total expenditure on medical and allied services in 1957–58 was £365,645, compared with £13,230 in 1936.

Communications

The main airfield, which is at Khormaksar, is operated under a joint-user arrangement by the Royal Air Force which controls meteorological and certain air-navigational facilities. H.F. R/T ground-to-air services and Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network services are provided by the Department of Civil Aviation and operated on its behalf by International Aeradio Limited.

Civil aircraft movements from January to August, 1958, averaged 681 per month.

Aden Airways Ltd., an associate of B.O.A.C., are based in the Colony and operate scheduled international services as well as regular domestic services to some eight points in the Aden Protectorate. Other airlines operating international services into the Colony are B.O.A.C., Air India International, Alitalia, Arab Airways (Jerusalem) Ltd., East African Airways Corporation, Sudan Airways, Ethiopia Air Lines, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Middle East Airlines. These services connect the Colony directly with the United Kingdom, Italy, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Lebanon, British and French Somalilands, Somalia, East Africa, India, Pakistan, Jordan, Syria, and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.

The Colony has a total of 107·20 miles of roads, of which 94·70 are bituminous macadam surfaced. There are no railways.

The vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and the number of vessels, exclusive of country craft, which entered the Port of Aden during 1957 was 4,308 with a tonnage of 18,230,821. The number of country craft which entered the Port during the same period was 1,594 with an aggregate tonnage of 130,131. There are 22 first-class berths and six second-class berths. The first-class berths are suitable for ships of from 350–800 feet in length. The second-class berths are suitable for ships of about 300 feet in length. Thirteen of the first-class berths are fitted with submarine pipelines for fuelling ships. The approach channel is dredged to 36 feet, and three of the largest fuelling berths are dredged to 39 feet. The Oil Harbour at Little Aden has four jetty berths, the approach channel being dredged to 38 feet and the Oil Harbour to 40 feet.

Broadcasting

The Aden Broadcasting Service, a part of the Public Relations and Information Department, was inaugurated in 1954 and transmits daily in Arabic on short wave 41·8 metres and medium wave 375 metres. The transmitters now in use are 7kW. and 5kW. respectively, and are situated at Khormaksar. In 1957, 811 receiving licences were issued. It is estimated that about 10,000 receivers are in use.

Principal Occupations

Of the estimated labour force of 56,000 some 7,500 are engaged in Port activities such as bunkering, handling of cargo, ship repairing, manning harbour vessels, and so forth; 7,500 in building and construction, 2,000 in oil refining, approximately 10,000 in various light industries, and upwards of 29,000 in retail and distributive trades, hotel and catering, domestic service and municipal services.

Main Products

There is no agriculture in the Colony and the only important local product is salt which is made from sea water by solar evaporation. This industry employs some 500 workers. Production in 1957 was about 197,836 tons.

There is a developing inshore fishing industry primarily engaged in tunny, kingfish and carangid fisheries. Production is increasing due to introduction of mechanized boats and better fishing gear under Government aid. Annual landings are estimated at 2,000 tons and catches are disposed of through fresh-fish markets and salt-fish exporters.

The oil refinery at Little Aden produces, from imported crude oil, a substantial quantity of refined petroleum for export. In 1957 these imports of crude oil were valued at some £29 million and exports at £26 million, together with another £18 million exported as fuel for ships' bunkers.

The factories in the Colony also produce aluminium domestic utensils, building materials, cigarettes, furniture, soft drinks, pottery; and dye and print cloth. These, and small producers of cloth by handloom, supply the local demand and provide for export to adjoining territories.

Trade (excluding bullion and specie)

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1938 | £5,310,075 | £2,680,591 |
| 1953 | £61,165,329 | £41,254,525 |
| 1954 | £64,883,735 | £44,347,635 |
| 1955 | £70,451,596 | £62,690,496 |
| 1956 | £71,227,903 | £64,455,923 |
| 1957 | £71,923,378 | £65,300,543 |

* Include ships' stores and bunkers.

Apart from the export of salt, the trade of Aden is mainly entrepôt and transhipment. The port serves as a centre of distribution to and from neighbouring territories. The salient features of the import trade are therefore repeated in the export figures. Traditional trade is mainly in cheap consumer goods, skins, hides, coffee, cotton piece-goods, grain, and flour. There is also trade in dates, sugar, tea, spices, oils, tobacco, gums and shells.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are at present no statutory or other marketing organizations in the Colony. A large new Central Wholesale Produce Market is, however, being built; its purpose is to rationalize the wholesaling of fruit and vegetables in the interests of both the producers in the Protectorate and the consumers in the Colony. The Market will be administered by an Authority to be established under the provisions of The Produce Marketing Ordinance, 1958. The Co-operative and Marketing Department has introduced co-operation to the fishermen in Colony waters, amongst whom two societies have been formed, and to other sections of the community.

PROTECTORATE

Area

The total area is approximately 112,000 square miles, including the Island of Socotra. The Protectorate is divided into Western and Eastern Areas.

Population is estimated at:

Western Area ... ... ... 355,000
Eastern Area ... ... ... 305,000

660,000

Towns

There are no large towns in the Western Aden Protectorate but in the Eastern Protectorate Mukalla, the sea port, has a population of some 20,000.

Geographical Features

The Aden Protectorate is bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba' al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen, and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges, about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains, over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Empty Quarter with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate also has a littoral belt, which is backed by a rock plateau rising to a height of 6,000 feet and continuing inland for about 100 miles, where it breaks up into a system of wadis, some fertile, leading into the main Wadi Hadhramaut. Beyond, to the north, are the sands of the Empty Quarter.

Climate

The altitude, which ranges from sea level up to 8,000 feet, is responsible for considerable variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. On the coastal plain torrid tropical conditions of great heat and humidity exist in the summer months. During the same period in the mid-altitude zones it is hot but less humid, while at the highest altitudes the climate is warm and temperate but can in the winter be extremely cold. The whole area falls within the influence of the north-east and south-west monsoons. Rainfall in the coastal areas averages approximately two inches a year; in the most favoured areas of the Western Aden Protectorate highlands it may average ten inches. In general, rainfall decreases from west to east until, in the north-east section, conditions of extreme aridity are encountered.

Mukeiras, a hill station on the Audhali plateau at 7,200 feet, is being developed as a summer resort for people seeking a respite from the heat of Aden.

History

For a time in the eighteenth century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana'a in the Yemen and several of the rulers of the tribal districts were the Imam's "wakils" or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with Her Majesty's Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being the Audhali Sultan in 1914.

In July 1915, during the first World War, the Turks, who had conquered the Yemen in the course of the previous century, occupied the Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts of the Protectorate until the Armistice of 1918.

In 1934 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Her Majesty's Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen. There was an Exchange of Notes in 1951 when it was agreed to establish reciprocal diplomatic missions and to set up a Frontier Commission.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa'i Sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala) entered into closer relations with His Majesty's Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. Similar treaties were signed by the Upper Aulaqi Sheikh and the Audhali Sultan in 1952, and by the Sheikh of Shu'eib in 1954. In 1952 the newly elected Sultan of Lahej accepted a political officer as adviser.

On 11th February 1959 a Federation of six states in the Western Protectorate, called the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South, was inaugurated and a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Federation. The six federated states are the Emirates of Beihan and of Dhala, the Fadhli, Audhali and Lower Yafa'i Sultanates, and the Upper Aulaqi Sheikdom. The treaty extended Her Majesty's protection to the Federation and provided for military and financial assistance to the Federation. It also provided for the possibility of other states in the Protectorate acceding to the Federation (see Cmdn. 665).

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri Sultans and the rise of the Qu'aiti—a new Yafa'i dynasty which gained power and wealth from military and other services rendered by its members abroad to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu'aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with Her Majesty's Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri Sultan made an agreement with the Qu'aiti Sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu'aiti and Kathiri Sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British resident adviser in all matters except those concerning Mohammedan religion and custom. The Wahidi Sultan of Balhaf signed an Advisory Treaty in 1949, and a similar treaty was signed by the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra in 1954.

Administration

Her Majesty's Government does not administer the Protectorate directly but the British Advisory Staff advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas.

In the Western Aden Protectorate the States nominate their own heads, who have subsequently to be recognized by the Governor of Aden.
all the heads of States and tribal chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery and in several States an efficient administration is now functioning. There are now State Councils in Lower Yafa'i, Amiri, Lower Aulaqi, Shu'eibi, Fadhli, Dathina, Beihan and Upper Aulaqi and there is a Legislative Council in Lahej. The Federation of Arab Emirates of the South has a legislative body called the Federal Council; the executive authority is exercised by the Supreme Council, made up of the Ministers of the Federation. For internal security some of the States have tribal guards (some partly paid for by Her Majesty's Government as a temporary measure) under the joint control of the Adviser and British Agent and the heads of States. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force known as the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate. They are stationed inland in fixed posts and are paid for and controlled entirely by Her Majesty's Government. This force is to become the National Guard of the new federation.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal States are the Qu'a'iti and Kathiri which are administered by their Sultans as constitutional rulers and have State Councils. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the supervision of the Resident Adviser and British Agent, Eastern Aden Protectorate. The island of Socotra is linked administratively with the mainland territory of Qishn under the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra.

Land Policy

Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenous inhabitants. The local State Governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trusts (waqfs). Land settlement is in progress in the Abyan area, Western Protectorate.

Taxation

The bulk of revenue collected by the Protectorate States comes from indirect taxes in the shape of Customs, excise and licence dues; in addition tithes are collected on agricultural products.

Public Finance

The following is a summary of Her Majesty's Government's expenditure in the Protectorate for the years 1956-57 and 1957-58:

Development Plans

The Aden Protectorate received an allocation of £500,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards various schemes and has received further allocations totalling £1,070,000 under the 1955 Act. The main schemes under the latter allocation are being devoted to agriculture and the construction of roads.

The largest development scheme, that in Abyan initiated in 1947, aims to achieve a better use of land and water resources, and has developed at a satisfactory rate in all fields where adequate staff, machinery and materials could be mustered. The scheme is administered by the Abyan Board, consisting of representatives of the two States in the Abyan Area, with Governmental advice available, and which works in partnership with landowners and owner-occupiers or tenant farmers. Cotton is grown as a main crop and marketed by the Board. An area of approximately 50,000 acres is now controlled for irrigation farming out of an estimated gross area of 120,000 acres.

Other Development

The Qu'a'iti State has allocated money to a total amount of £325,000 for development schemes throughout the State; the original allocation of £75,000 was, and is still being, used for promoting agriculture in the Wadi Hadhramout by lift irrigation and flood control, and later allocations amounting to some £250,000 are being reserved primarily for improving the water supply of the growing town of Mukalla and for extending and developing agriculture in the central and maritime provinces of the State and fishing along the coast. The Kathiri State has £30,000 allocated for agricultural development.

Education in the States varies greatly in development, the Qu'a'iti State being at present the most advanced. It has a school of six post-primary standards at Gheil Ba-Wazir and an
Intermediate School in Mukalla. A new Intermediate School is also projected at Seiyun. The total number of pupils receiving post-primary education in the Eastern Aden Protectorate in Government and private schools is about 550. At Lahej in the Abdali State there is an Intermediate School, following the Egyptian syllabus, and intermediate schools at Zinjibar in the Fadhli State and another at Jaar in the Lower Yafa'i. There are about 200 boys at these schools. Below this level there are about 80 primary (or lower than primary) schools with a total of some 4,000 boys. This does not include small Koranic schools which are found in many places, nor the private schools of strongly religious bias, of which there are more than 30 in the Wadi Hadhramaut alone.

Girls' education is of fairly recent development. There are now five schools following the primary syllabus—two at Mukalla, one at Seiyun, one at Zinjibar and one at Shuqra—with a total of about 500 girls. In addition there are ten girls' schools and one mixed school of a lower level with about 700 girls. Most of these are in the Eastern Protectorate.

Thirty-four students are on scholarships abroad, 5 in the Sudan, 24 in Egypt and 5 in the United Kingdom.

In 1956-57 about £125,000 was expended on education (£27,978 of it by Her Majesty's Government) compared with £22,000 in 1947.

Health

A Health Adviser, Aden Protectorate, first appointed in 1951 is responsible for the health services in both Protectorates. Organized State health services exist in the West in Fadhli and Lower Yafa'i (which share in a combined service) and in Lahej. The Qu'aiti and Kathiri States in the Eastern Protectorate have their own health services. Elsewhere States contribute in varying degree towards services provided by Her Majesty's Government. An Assistant Health Adviser in each Protectorate is the local administrative and field executive for the areas which as yet have no developed services of their own, and assists the Health Adviser in all his functions. There are 33 rural health units in charge of Health Assistants, with some sub-professional staff trained in simple curative and preventive practices. There are ten mobile doctor's units. In the West at Makhzan (Abyan) and in the East at Mukalla there are base hospitals with associated training centres.

Communications

A regular air service by Aden Airways is maintained throughout the year between Aden and Mukeiras, and Aden, Riyan (18 miles from Mukalla) Al Qatn and Al Ghuraf in the Wadi Hadhramaut.

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate. Increasing use is being made of motor vehicles. These are for the most part driven along sandy beaches, dry river beds or across open desert, but several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic and in a few cases new roads have been cut through difficult country. Roads are extremely rough and surfaces are infrequently repaired. Routes for new and improved roads are being surveyed.

A coastal road in the Eastern Aden Protectorate runs from Reidat al Abdal Wadud in the east through Shihir, Mukalla, Bir Ali and Balhaf to connect with the Western Aden Protectorate. Roads run inland from Shihir and Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut and from near Balhaf to Azzan and Habban. The approximate total mileage of motorable tracks in the Eastern Aden Protectorate is 2,680 miles. The desert between the Wadi Hadhramaut and Beihan is also traversed by motors. Where these cannot yet penetrate the traffic is carried on camel caravans, which still travel to Aden from the Western Aden Protectorate and to Mukalla and Shihir from other parts of the Eastern Aden Protectorate in large numbers. Donkeys are also employed for both passengers and goods.

Sea communications along the coast of the Protectorate are mainly by dhows, some of which have auxiliary engines. Small powered craft and coastal steamers make occasional and irregular visits to Mukalla and Shihir from Aden.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture employs about 90 per cent. of the population; other occupations are fishing, dyeing, weaving, and preparation of hides and skins.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sorghum, millet, bulrush millet, wheat, barley, sesame, cotton (long staple), dates and Hamami tobacco.

Cotton, first introduced into the Fadhli and Lower Yafa'i areas of the Western Protectorate in 1949, is now being grown in several States.

Production figures (400 lb. bales cotton lint) are:

| Year | Production |
|------|------------|
| 1949 | 100        |
| 1950 | 1,587      |
| 1951 | 9,890      |
| 1952 | 7,206      |
| 1953 | 11,161     |
| 1954 | 23,514     |
| 1955 | 24,000     |
| 1956 | 33,000     |

A rough estimate of the livestock population is:

- Camels: 80,000
- Cattle: 68,000
- Goats: 855,000
- Sheep: 200,000
- Donkeys: 7,000

The annual catch of wet fish has been estimated at 70,000 tons for a good season. At least 75 per cent. of this is taken in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. Most of the fish is cured for consumption inland and for export to East Africa and the Far East.

External Trade

The principal imports are grain, flour, rice, dates, sugar, sesame oil, tea, kerosene, spice, cloth, cotton piece-goods, tobacco, cigarettes, soap and glassware.

The principal exports are cotton, coffee, skins and hides, lime, Hamami tobacco, cattle, ghee, sheep, goats and fish.

The great bulk of trade with the Western Aden Protectorate goes by land from the town of Aden, and that with the Eastern Aden Protectorate goes by sea to the port of Mukalla. No reliable figures are available.
Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Abyan Board, mentioned above, markets cotton overseas on a considerable scale. It deals not only with the crops from lands within the area of the Board, but also with the cotton grown in other States in the Eastern and Western Protectorates. In several of those States, the local handling of the crop is now undertaken by Cotton Producers' Associations, five of which were established in 1957 as a result of decrees by the States concerned. They may be regarded as embryo co-operative societies. A tobacco growers' co-operative has been established in the Eastern Protectorate. A start has been made on the organization of fruit and vegetable marketing societies in the Western Protectorate, and considerable success has attended recent efforts of the Co-operative and Marketing Department to encourage the transport of such produce by air to Aden.

KAMARAN ISLAND

The island of Kamaran in the Red Sea has been in British occupation since 1915. It does not form part of either the Colony of Aden or the Aden Protectorate, but the Governor of Aden is also the Governor of Kamaran under the provisions of the Kamaran Order in Council, 1949. Prior to that the island was under the control of the Government of India, exercised through the Governor of Aden and a local Civil Administrator, whose designation became Commissioner in 1949. Until 1953 a Quarantine Station was run in Kamaran for pilgrims on their way to Jedda by sea. This has now been closed.

Expenditure on the administration of Kamaran in 1957-58 was £30,124, of which £27,729 was contributed by Her Majesty's Government.

The island has an airport and Aden Airways planes land there on scheduled services.
