THE WEST INDIES (FEDERATION)

The Federating Territories

The Federation of The West Indies which came into being in January, 1958, comprises the Territories of Barbados; Jamaica (including the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands); the Leeward Islands of Antigua, Montserrat, and St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla; Trinidad and Tobago; and the Windward Islands of Grenada, Dominica, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. It does not include British Guiana, British Honduras or the Virgin Islands (Leeward Islands).

Geography and Area

The ten colonies comprising The West Indies, each consisting of one or more islands, are situated in, or on the borders of, the Caribbean Sea. Jamaica, the largest, is part of the Greater Antilles group; the remainder belong to the chain of the Lesser Antilles. The total land area of the federating territories is 8,028-8 square miles.

Population

On the basis of estimates made in unit territories in 1956 and 1957, the total population of the Federation is approximately 3,100,000.

Capital

Trinidad is the seat of the Federal Capital. At present the Federal Government is in temporary quarters in Port-of-Spain. Permanent quarters will be built when the site of the capital in Trinidad has been decided upon.

History

The move towards political federation has developed over a long period of years, and has been hastened by, among other things, the rapid improvement in air communications since the end of the second world war. A despatch sent to West Indian Governments in March 1945, by the late Colonel Oliver Stanley, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, stressed that "the aim of British policy should be the development of federation in the Caribbean at such time as the balance of opinion in the various Colonies is in favour of a change, and when the development of communications makes it administratively practicable. The ultimate aim of any federation which may be established would be full internal self-government within the British Commonwealth". At Colonel Stanley's suggestion the idea of political federation was debated in the legislatures of all the Colonies of the region except that of the Bahamas, where the decision was taken against doing so, and, in September 1947, a Conference on Closer Association was held at Montego Bay, Jamaica, presided over by Mr. A. Creech Jones and attended by delegates and legal and financial advisers from Barbados, British Guiana, British Honduras, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad, and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. All the delegates, except those from British Guiana, accepted the principle of federation and on their recommendation a Standing Closer Association Committee was set up to work out a draft federal constitution.

That Committee, composed of 17 West Indians selected by their respective legislatures met in 1948 and 1949 and its Report (Col. No. 255, 1950) made recommendations on which the present bi-cameral Federal Legislature and Federal Executive are based. The Report was accepted, with certain reservations, by all the legislatures except those of British Guiana and the British Virgin Islands (Leewards group) which rejected them, and that of British Honduras which considered it premature for that Colony to commit itself to federation.

A further Conference on West Indian Federation held in London in April 1953, attended by West Indian and United Kingdom delegates, and by observers from British Guiana and British Honduras, agreed upon a "Plan for a British Caribbean Federation" (Cmd. 8895,1953) based upon the Standing Closer Association Committee's proposals. By February 1955 this plan had been adopted by all the legislatures that debated it.

The next step was a Conference on Movement of Persons within a British Caribbean Federation held in Trinidad in March 1955, and attended by West Indian and United Kingdom delegates and an observer from British Guiana. This conference recommended that there should be the greatest possible freedom of movement within the Federation, and that the control of movement between Territories should be placed on the concurrent legislative list as a matter on which both the federal legislature and the territorial legislatures should be empowered to legislate, with federal law prevailing. It also recommended that the British Government should be requested to proceed with the greatest possible speed with the completion of the preliminary measures to enable the Federation to be established. Both recommendations were accepted by all the legislatures concerned.

Later in 1955, Commissions headed by Sir Sydney Caine, Sir Hilary Blood and Sir Allan Chalmers Smith were appointed to examine respectively the Fiscal, Civil Service and Judicial aspects of Federation, and their Reports were published in December 1955 (Cmd. 9618, 9619 and 9620).

The final Conference on British Caribbean Federation was held in London in February 1956 and was attended, as before, by delegates from the West Indian and United Kingdom Governments and by observers from British Guiana and British Honduras. At that Conference the decision to "be bound together in federation" was taken, and it was agreed to make provision for British Guiana, British Honduras and the British Virgin Islands to be admitted later if they so wished. The "Plan for a British Caribbean Federation" (see above) was adopted, with certain modifications, as the basis for the Federal Constitution, and a Standing Federation Committee was set up under the chairmanship of Sir Stephen Luke, the Comptroller for Development and Welfare in the West Indies, to consider further the drafting of the constitution and to make the necessary administrative preparations for the establishment of the Federal Government. The composition of the Committee was the same as that of the West Indian delegations to the Conference, i.e., three delegates from Barbados, three from Jamaica, one from each of the participating Leeward Islands, three from Trinidad and Tobago, and one from each of the Windward Islands, together with two observers from British Guiana and one from British Honduras. This Committee met four times during 1956 and 1957, and under its direction a Pre-Federal Organization was set up with headquarters in Barbados and later in Trinidad.
The 1956 London Conference was unable to reach agreement on the location of the Federal Capital, and on their recommendation a Fact-finding Commission was set up, under the chairmanship of Sir Francis Mudie, to visit the West Indies and make recommendations on the three most suitable sites in order of preference, bearing in mind such factors as political and social sentiment, availability of land, cost of buildings, communications and other services. The choice of the Commission (Report; Colonial No. 328, 1956) was Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad in that order. The Standing Federation Committee, having considered this Report, decided at its meeting in January 1957 that the Capital should be situated in Trinidad.

The British Caribbean Federation Act, which received the Royal Assent on 2nd August, 1956, enabled Her Majesty, by Order in Council, to provide for the federation of the colonies concerned and for the establishment of a Federal Government, a Federal Legislature, a Federal Supreme Court and other necessary Federal authorities, to provide that any appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Supreme Court should be in substitution for the jurisdiction of the West Indian Court of Appeal, and to provide for the accession of other colonies to the Federation. The Act also provided for the payment of a grant not exceeding £1,000,000 from Her Majesty's Government towards the cost of establishing the Federal Capital and for the making of further annual grants during the first ten years of federation to enable the Federal Government to assist the Governments of those federating Territories whose resources are insufficient to meet their administrative expenses. Under this Act the West Indies (Federation) Order in Council, 1957, incorporating the Federal Constitution, was made in July of that year.

At a meeting in February 1957 the Standing Federation Committee agreed that the name of the Federation should be "The West Indies". It was announced in May 1957 that Her Majesty had approved the appointment of the Right Honourable Lord Hailes, G.B.E., to be Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Federation. This appointment became effective on the 1st October, and Lord Hailes assumed office in Trinidad on the 3rd January, 1958.

The first elections were held on 25th March, 1958, in all the territories and resulted in the majority party, The West Indies Federal Labour Party, taking office.

The Federal Parliament was inaugurated on 22nd April, 1958, by H.R.H. the Princess Margaret.

Constitution

The constitution, the interim provisions of which came into force in January 1958, provides for a bicameral Legislature comprising a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Senate is composed of 19 members appointed by the Governor-General in his discretion on a basis of Territorial representation after consultation with the Governors of the Territories represented. A President and Vice-President are elected by the Senate from among its members. After each successive period of five years all Senators vacate their seats, but their terms of office are not affected by a dissolution of the Federal Legislature. The House of Representatives consists of 45 members elected by adult suffrage in the federating Territories. The House elects a Speaker either from among its members or from among other persons and a Deputy Speaker from among its members. A person appointed to the Senate or elected to the House of Representatives who is already a member of a Territorial Legislature or Executive Council may not take part in the proceedings of the Senate or House of Representatives until he has ceased to be a member of the Territorial Legislature or Executive Council; and if he has not ceased to be such a member at the expiration of 21 days he vacates his seat in the Federal Legislature. The Federal Legislature is dissolved by the Governor-General after a period of not more than five years from the date when the House of Representatives first meets after a General Election.

The powers of the Senate to prevent the passage of legislation are restricted in that, in certain circumstances, a Bill may be presented to the Governor-General for assent notwithstanding that the Senate has not consented to the Bill. When a Bill is presented to the Governor-General he may assent to it, refuse assent or reserve it for Her Majesty's pleasure. The Federal Legislature has power to make laws on any matter included in the Exclusive Legislative List or Concurrent Legislative List scheduled under the Constitution. Territorial Legislatures have power to make laws on any matter included in the Concurrent Legislative List, but in general will not have such power with respect to matters included in the Exclusive Legislative List. In cases of inconsistency between Federal and Territorial laws, Federal law prevails.

The constitution enables Her Majesty to legislate by Order in Council for the Federation for the purposes of defence, external relations, and securing or maintaining the financial stability of the Federation.

The Federal Executive consists of a Governor-General appointed by Her Majesty and a Council of State consisting of a Prime Minister elected by the House of Representatives and ten other Ministers appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister, of whom at least three must be members of the Senate and the remainder must be members of the House of Representatives. The Governor-General normally presides at meetings of the Council of State, and is in general bound to exercise his functions in accordance with the advice of the Council. He may, in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister, assign to any Minister responsibility for dealing with any business on behalf of the Federal Government, but is not obliged to do so in respect of defence, the audit of Federal accounts or the appointment, dismissal or disciplinary control of officers in the Federal public service.

The constitution provides for a Federal Supreme Court, consisting of a Chief Justice and three or more Federal Justices appointed by the Governor-General in his discretion after consultation with the Prime Minister, and contains provision regarding the jurisdiction of the Court. The constitution also provides for a Public Service Commission to advise the Governor-General on the appointment, dismissal and disciplinary control of Federal public officers. The Commission consists of a Chairman and between two and four members appointed by the Governor-General in his discretion.

The provisions for amendment of the Constitution by Order in Council include provision for amendment for the purpose of including other
Colonies within the Federation. There is provision for a review of the Constitution not later than the fifth anniversary of the date on which it came into force.

Public Finance

The main source of Federal revenue during the first five years of federation will be an annual levy upon the Territorial Governments the maximum annual amount of which ($9,120,000—equivalent to £1,900,000) is based on an estimate by Sir Sydney Caine, pre-Federal Fiscal Commissioner (Report—Cmd. 9618, 1955) of the yield that might be expected if Federal customs and excise duties were levied on certain commodities at certain rates. During the first five years no Federal income tax (except tax on emoluments paid from Federal funds) may be levied. Under the terms of the Constitution the Federal Legislature may make laws with regard to customs and excise duties but the Federal Government may only retain the revenue from duties levied under any such law on certain scheduled commodities and, during the first five years, at certain scheduled rates. Moreover, during the first five years, Federal revenue obtained from the Territorial levy and from any customs and excise duties on the scheduled commodities may not together exceed the sum of $9,120,000, any excess actually raised having to be returned to the Territorial Governments.

The Federal Government has assumed the responsibilities hitherto undertaken by the Comptroller for Development and Welfare in the West Indies for the administration of grants made under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts for regional development schemes and for advising the Secretary of State on applications from individual Territories for assistance under the Acts. It will also, from 1959, receive from Her Majesty's Government an annual grant of £1,750,000 a year for the next five years to enable it to assist those territories (at present Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Turks and Caicos Islands) whose resources are insufficient to enable them to meet the expenses of administration; grants for this purpose have hitherto been paid direct by Her Majesty's Government to the territories concerned.

Communications

An extensive network of British and foreign airlines connects the territories with each other, with other islands in the region, and with South and Central America, the U.S.A., Canada and Europe. There is an inter-island shipping service operated on behalf of the Federal Government, and there are also numerous shipping lines serving the Federation. Particulars of these airlines and shipping companies are to be found under the unit territories below.

Assumption by Federal Government of functions of former Regional Organizations

The Regional Economic Committee ceased to exist at the end of 1957, its functions being taken over by the Federal Government. The duties formerly performed by the secretariat of the Regional Economic Committee were distributed between the various Federal Ministries or Departments concerned.

The Regional Council of Ministers, which was set up by the Standing Federation Committee in May, 1957, to consider matters in the economic sphere of common interest to the territories of the Federation and to other British Caribbean territories, has not met since that time. Its future is under consideration by the Federal Government. Without prejudice to this question, the Federal Government has recently put forward proposals for the setting up of a Regional Natural Resources Council, and subsidiary bodies, to provide for consultation in the field of natural resources and agriculture, and allied subjects. These arrangements would provide for the continuation of the work formerly done by the British Caribbean Advisory Council on Agriculture, Animal Health and Husbandry, Forestry and Fisheries and the Technical Co-ordinating Committee for Agricultural and Allied Research.

The Development and Welfare Organisation was set up in 1940, as a result of the recommendations of the West India Royal Commission (Cmd. 6607); its primary function was to work out, in collaboration with local governments, long-term programmes of social reform and schemes of development and welfare for which grants from United Kingdom funds under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts might be recommended. Many of the functions of the Organisation, which ceased to operate on 31st March, 1958, have been taken over by the Federal Government, which maintains a full cadre of advisers, whose services are available on request to the governments of the federated territories, and also to non-federated territories in the British Caribbean. These functions include the provision of the chairmanship and secretariat services for the Regional Labour Board, which controls the various government schemes for assisting the employment of West Indian workers in the U.S.A. and supervises the work of the British West Indian Labour Organisation in New York; the chairmanship and secretariat facilities for the Standing Advisory Committee on Medical Research; and the provision of facilities for other standing or ad hoc regional conferences.

Barbados

Area, etc.

Barbados is the most easterly of the Caribbean islands. Its total area is 166 square miles.

Population

At the end of 1957 the population was estimated at 232,227; the 1946 census gives the racial divisions as:

- African descent : : : 77·24%
- Mixed descent : : : 17·55%
- European descent : : : 5·10%

Principal Town

Bridgetown, the capital, is the only town. Its population is about 18,650.

Geographical Features

The Island is comparatively flat, rising in a series of tablelands marked by well-defined terraces to the highest point (1,104 feet) at Mount Hillaby. The north-east corner of the Island, the Scotland area, is broken country, much eroded and rather barren. The formation of the rest of the Island is coral limestone. There are no rivers, but deep gullies which fill with water during heavy rain have cut their way through the coral terraces in many places. Indigenous forest covers about 46 acres.

Climate

The climate is extremely pleasant. North-easterly trade winds blow steadily from December to June but during the remainder of the year, the wet season, the wind moves to the south-east and is less strong, resulting in humid, hotter conditions. The average temperature is 79·8°. The rainfall is very varied; in the high central district the yearly average is 75 inches while in some of the low-lying coastal areas the average is 50 inches.

History

Uncertainty remains on some points in the early history of Barbados and differing versions have appeared from time to time. The brief account which follows is based on what is taken to be the most authentic version.

As far as is known the original inhabitants were the Arawak Indians who migrated from the mainland of South America. When they arrived is not known, but relics of their occupation down to the latter years of the sixteenth century have been discovered in various parts of the Island. By the time the English settlers came they had disappeared, partly through Carib raids from the neighbouring islands, and partly through the Spaniards who deported them to work in the mines of Hispaniola.

In spite of the belief to the contrary, there is no satisfactory evidence that the Olive Branch under Captain Catlin ever touched at Barbados when it was driven off its course from England to the River
Wiapoco settlement in 1605 and fetched up at St. Lucia. The first Englishman to visit Barbados may have been Captain Simon Gordan, who claimed that he had landed some time before the settlement of 1627 and had found the Island uninhabited. He may, however, have been on a ship under the command of Sir Thomas Warner that visited sometime between 1620 and 1624 and found the Island suffering from such a severe drought that the latter preferred settlement of his colonists at St. Kitts. In 1624 or early 1625 a ship, belonging to Sir William Courteen and under the command of Captain John Powell, touched at Barbados, when en route from Pernambuco to England; some men were landed who erected a cross and on a tree nearby inscribed "James K. of E. and of this Island". On receiving Powell's information about Barbados Sir William Courteen fitted out an expedition to the Island under the command of his informant; but Powell, who carried letters of marque, captured a Spanish or Portuguese prize and returned with it to Cowes in 1626. Courteen then fitted out a second expedition and in February, 1627, the William and John under the command of Captain Henry Powell—Captain John Powell's younger brother—landed 80 settlers. During 1627 and 1628 the colony grew rapidly and by the end of 1628 it was claimed that Courteen had planted 1,850 settlers. The Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I for all the Caribbean islands and landed settlers in 1628. After his death his son leased the Island in 1647 for 21 years to Lord Willoughby of Parham who assumed the government of the Island and during the Civil War held it for the Royalists until his capitulation to the Cromwellian fleet in 1652. A Governor was appointed by the Commonwealth in place of Lord Willoughby and at the Restoration the claims of the Carlisle Patent were revived. An agreement was reached by which the Patent was surrendered to the Crown for compensation in the form of 4½% duty on exports. This duty was a continual source of complaint but was not abolished until 1838 by Act of Imperial Parliament. The importance of the agreement, however, is that it marked the end of proprietary rule. Since its settlement Barbados has been a possession of Great Britain.

**Constitution**

Barbados has one of the oldest Constitutions in the Commonwealth and one in which conventions play an important part.

The Legislature consists of the Governor; an Upper House—the Legislative Council—consisting of members (usually about 15) appointed by Her Majesty; and a Lower House—the House of Assembly—consisting of 24 members elected by universal adult suffrage. Members of the Legislative Council may be appointed for periods of up to 15 years but are normally appointed for five years at a time. The life of a House of Assembly is limited to five years. The Governor may exercise a veto on legislation but has no positive reserved legislative powers.

The three main executive organs are the Executive Council, consisting of the Governor, the Chief Secretary and Attorney General, and other members appointed by Her Majesty (at present 3); the Executive Committee, consisting of the Executive Council with the addition of members appointed from the Legislative Council (at present 1) and the House of Assembly (at present 5); and the Cabinet, consisting of the Premier and those members of the Executive Committee who are not members of the Executive Council, i.e. the members appointed from the two Houses of the Legislature. Of these three bodies the Executive Council, the original executive organ, now survives for a limited number of largely formal functions only and, since the establishment of the Cabinet at the beginning of 1958, the role of the Executive Committee too has been very much reduced, although it is open to either the Governor or the Premier to request a meeting of the full Committee.

The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears best able to command a majority in the House of Assembly. By convention he is then appointed a member of the Executive Council (and so automatically of the Executive Committee) for as long as he holds office. On the Premier's advice the Governor also appoints other Ministers, who become the members of the Executive Committee appointed from the House of Assembly, and a Minister without Portfolio, who becomes the member of the Executive Committee appointed from the Legislative Council.

**Land Policy**

The systems of land tenure are similar to those of the United Kingdom.

**Taxation**

Income tax is the main form of direct taxation. The tax rates range from 3 cents on every complete $ of taxable income up to $500, to 75 cents on every complete $ of taxable income beyond $24,000. Tax is not paid on incomes below $800 per annum in the case of single individuals and $1,400 in the case of married persons. A wife's earned income allowance not exceeding $300 is granted. Deductions from taxable income of $270 are allowed for children and $240 for other dependants, in the latter case not exceeding two. Deductions are also permitted on life insurances. Medical expenses may be deducted in excess of $20 but not exceeding in the aggregate $100, in the case of a taxpayer of married status, or $50 in the case of any other person, plus $25 for each child, not exceeding two. Companies pay a flat rate of 40%. The rate for life assurance companies is the average paid by an individual with a taxable income of $4,800.

A non-cumulative system of Pay As You Earn is in operation.

Estate duties range from 1% on estates not exceeding $4,800 and not exceeding $14,400 to 30% on estates over $1,920,000. In addition, succession duty ranges from 1% between $96 and $2,400 to 2% at values exceeding $9,600 where the successor is a lineal descendant or ancestor and from 2% to 10% where the successor is a stranger.

Entertainment tax is charged on certain forms of entertainment.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariffs and excise duty on rum production.

**Public Finance**

| Year    | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39 | 2,535,734   | 2,622,115       |
| 1952–53 | 13,757,830  | 11,423,911      |

| 1957–58 | 20,684,883  | 19,270,986      |
In 1957–58, $9,680,513 was derived from Customs and Excise and $7,951,715 from direct taxation.

The main heads of expenditure for the same year were as follows:

| Service                          | Expenditure |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Social Services (education, health and old age pensions) | $6,391,052   |
| Public Works (including roads and water) | $2,798,752   |
| Subventions and Miscellaneous Services | $1,532,450   |
| Police and Prisons               | $1,483,732   |
| Agriculture                      | $719,908     |
| Subsidies and Controls           | $378,498     |

Expenditure on Capital Account amounting to $5,833,469, was met from loan funds, surplus balances, and Colonial Development and Welfare grants.

The Public Debt at the 1st of April, 1958, was $9,655,728, approximately $41.57 per head of population. Towards this an amount of $2,368,878 was provided by sinking funds.

At 1st April, 1958, the amount of free surplus balances was $3,941,646.

Currency

The currency in circulation is a West Indian currency issued by the Board of the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern group) consisting of Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. Currency notes are of denominations $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100. British coin is legal tender but the chief medium of circulation is the new British Caribbean coin in denominations of 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents, 1 cent and a half cent.

The West Indian $ is fixed at 4s. 2d., that is $4.80 to £1 sterling.

Development Plans

The Five-Year Development Plan for 1955–60 was approved by the Legislature in March 1957 and involves expenditure of some $50,000,000. By far the largest single project in the Plan is the construction of a Deep Water Harbour for the port of Bridgetown, which accounts for about 40% of expenditure under the Plan. The major features of this project, on which work was begun in 1957, are the reclamation of over 100 acres of land, the construction of a breakwater nearly 3,000 feet in length, the dredging of a substantial area within the breakwater, and the erection of a sugar store and bulk loading machinery on the reclaimed land.

Other important schemes to be undertaken include an expanded housing programme costing nearly $8,000,000; the construction of a new hospital for which over $3,000,000 is provided in the Plan; the building, reconstruction and extension of a number of new and existing primary and secondary schools at a cost of almost $3,000,000; expenditure of the same order on agricultural development; and schemes for improving water supplies, the road system, airport facilities, gas distribution and the omnibus service, each costing $1,000,000 or more.

Well over half the total expenditure on the Plan is to be met from local resources. An external loan of £2,584,000 was raised in January, 1959, for the purpose of financing the Deep Water Harbour Scheme.

Education

Educational policy aims at the integration of the primary and secondary systems of education and the eventual introduction of compulsory education for children between the ages of 5 and 14 years.

Education at the primary stage is provided in primary schools, in the preparatory departments of Government-aided secondary schools and in independent schools. Secondary education is provided in the senior departments of the primary schools, in secondary modern schools, Government-aided secondary grammar schools and some independent schools. No fees are charged in the primary and secondary modern schools. Tuition fees in secondary grammar schools range from $12 to $72 per annum.

There are 116 primary schools, and 4 secondary modern schools, which are entirely maintained by Government funds. At the close of the school year 1957–58 the number of registered pupils was 37,992 (19,472 boys, 18,520 girls). There are 10 government-aided secondary grammar schools (3 first grade and 7 second grade) with an attendance of 3,918 pupils (2,555 boys, 1,363 girls), Erdiston Training College now provides a two-year residential course for approximately 100 students including 32 from the Windward and Leeward Islands. Under the Barbados Five-Year Training Scheme and the Caribbean Vocational Training Scheme scholarships are awarded annually to teachers in both Elementary and Government-aided Secondary Schools for study in the United Kingdom as well as Caribbean Institutions. Codrington College, affiliated to the University of Durham, is a Theological College. There were 32 students in residence during 1957–58.

During the academic year there were 39 Government Scholars and Exhibitioners attending Universities overseas: 15 in the United Kingdom, 2 in Canada, and 22 at the University College of the West Indies.

Adult education is provided by the Barbados Evening Institute in Academic and Commercial courses and at the Housecraft Centre in Home Economics. Technical education is now provided at the Technical Institute established in 1955. It offers courses at three levels, viz., for craftsmen, for technicians, and for those desirous of proceeding to advanced technological studies. The Board of Industrial Training awards 48 bursaries annually for training in various trades under apprenticeship schemes with master workmen, but its functions will soon be taken over by the newly established Apprenticeship Board.

Expenditure on education services in 1957–58 was $3,278,161, compared with $269,342 in 1935–36.

Libraries and Museums

A free Public Library (64,642 books) is maintained by Government. At British Council headquarters there are also a Music Library and a Reference Library. The Barbados Museum and Historical Society possesses collections of books, pictures, models, specimens of birds and fishes, and a collection of relics of the original Arawak inhabitants of the island.

Health

The Barbados General Hospital has accommodation for 44 paying patients and 402 non-paying patients. In-patient attendances numbered 10,970,
out-patient attendances 114,353 in 1957. The Government maintains a mental hospital with accommodation for 320 males and 471 females and a leper hospital at which there are 20 patients. For the training of midwives the Government Maternity Hospital has accommodation for 20 expectant mothers. Each of the 11 parishes has an almshouse for the care of the destitute sick and for the housing of the aged and poor. These almshouses provide medical care and in some parishes function as district hospitals.

Preventive medicine is based on the Health Centre System. Three Centres are operating, in St. Michael, St. Peter and St. Philip.

Estimated expenditure on Health Services amounted to $2,427,728 in 1957–58 compared with $206,870 in 1935–36.

Communications

An International Airport is situated at Seawell, 12 miles from Bridgetown. Air France, British Overseas Airways Corporation, British West Indian Airways, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, Pan American World Airways, and Trans-Canada Air Lines operate frequent scheduled services connecting Barbados with the major world air routes.

There are 664 miles of road open to traffic, 371 miles of which are bituminous surfaced.

Bridgetown is the only port of entry, although some loading of sugar takes place at Speightstown and oil is pumped ashore at Spring Gardens and an Esso installation on the West Coast.

The main shipping companies visiting Barbados are Harrison Line, Elder and Fyffes Line, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Saguenay Terminals, Booth Line, Alcoa Steamship Company, Lamport and Holt Line, M.A.N.Z. Line, Moore McCormack Line, Nourse Line, Three Bays Line, and the West Indies Steam Navigation Company. During the year the Canadian National Steamships were withdrawn and the Canadian Service of the Alcoa Steamship Company replaced by the Lamport and Holt Line. Occasionally ships of the Linea "C" and Grimaldi Lines visit port.

Broadcasting

A wired system, which is now island-wide, is operated by a local company—Barbados Rediffusion Service Limited. It has 18,807 subscribers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in the cultivation of the sugar crop and auxiliary occupations connected with the sugar industry. Approximate figures are:—23,000 persons engaged in agriculture, 16,000 in domestic service, 12,000 in the retail trade and 7,000 in construction work. About 2,500 persons are engaged in the fishing industry.

At the end of 1957, there were eight Trade Unions of which five were employers' associations with membership totalling about 328 business concerns and three workers organizations with about 13,000 members.

Main Crops and Products

Sugar cane is the principal export crop grown on all plantations and on nearly all small holdings. In 1958, sugar production was the equivalent of 152,847 long tons. Yams, sweet potatoes, eddoes, cassava, maize and pigeon peas comprise the main food crops which are grown in accordance with regulations issued annually. Green vegetables and other crops are cultivated on a minor scale and there is a limited production of tree crops and citrus fruit.

The estimated numbers of livestock are as follows:

- Cattle, 15,000
- Pigs, 27,500
- Sheep, 24,800
- Goats, 8,050

A Central Livestock Station has been established to investigate the possibility of developing an economic system of animal husbandry, with special attention to dairying.

A Fisheries Section of the Department of Agriculture has been established in recent years for the investigation of more efficient methods of marine fishing and to encourage their use. The estimated catch of fish during 1957 was 5,845,600 lb. valued at $1,461,400.

Production of natural gas during the year ended March 31, 1958, was 101 million cubic feet. During 1956, 6,852 tons of temper, building and manurial limestone were exported.

Manufactures include the production of sugar for local consumption, rum, bread and a variety of biscuits, edible oil, aerated waters, cigarettes, soap, ice and furniture.

Population
The mid-year estimate of Jamaica's population in 1957 was 1,594,800. At the 1953 sample census the total population was 1,476,923 with the following racial origins:

- European: 17,795
- African: 1,124,529
- East Indian: 35,493
- Chinese: 18,655
- "Coloured": 243,961
- Other races: 3,119

Principal Towns
The capital is Kingston, which, together with Port Royal, has an estimated population of 162,258. The other principal towns are:

| Population (1943 census) |
|--------------------------|
| Montego Bay              | 11,547 |
| Spanish Town             | 12,007 |

Geographical Features
The Island is mountainous and rises in the centre to 7,402 feet (Blue Mountain Peak). The area of land over 1,000 feet above sea level is 2,110 square miles. There are numerous rivers. Forest lands comprise about 480,000 acres (approximately 17% of the total land area), of which 233,664 constitute the Government Forest Reserves.

Climate
Generally speaking, the rainy months are May and October but in the extreme north-east winter rains fall between November and January. The heaviest annual rainfall, which exceeds 200 inches, occurs near the Blue Mountain Ridge in the north-east, the lowest in the extreme south. Hurricanes occur on the average once in seven years. The following table shows the temperatures and rainfall for selected places in 1957.

History
The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted for over a century and a half. When the riches of Mexico and Peru were opened up by the conquistadores, the Spaniards flocked to the mainland from the island colonies and Jamaica became little more than a supply base for expeditions to the mainland of America. The population, which had never been very great, dwindled to an insignificant and impoverished community which offered little resistance to the English invasion under Admiral Penn and General Venables in 1655. With this date the modern history of the
Jamaican people may be said to begin. The last attempt to recover the island for Spain collapsed and the last remnant of the Spaniards left Jamaica from Runaway Bay in 1660. The Spaniards had imported slaves from Africa, most of whom they took with them, but a small number remained in the mountains of the interior and formed the nucleus of the Maroons. Of the present community, the founders and pioneers were colonists who came from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the seventeenth century.

**Constitution**

On the 8th October, 1957, the Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council was made further extending the Constitution of 1944. The Order provides for:

1. The replacement of the Executive Council by a Council of Ministers presided over by the Chief Minister. The Governor has the right to call special meetings of the Council and, when he does so, to preside at them;
2. The removal of the Colonial Secretary and the Financial Secretary from the Legislative Council and an increase from twelve to fourteen in the minimum number of unofficial members;
3. Retention by the Governor of responsibility for defence, external affairs, the audit of accounts of Government, the dependencies, and appointments, dismissals and discipline in the public service;
4. Change of title of the Colonial Secretary to Chief Secretary.

The changes were introduced on the 11th November, 1957.

The present constitution provides for a Privy Council, a Council of Ministers, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

The Privy Council consists of the Chief Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary and two nominated unofficial members. It advises the Governor in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government service and in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy.

The Council of Ministers consists of twelve Ministers, of whom ten (including the Chief Minister) are members of the House of Representatives and two are Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council.

The Legislature consists of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives.

The Legislative Council consists of one ex officio member (the Attorney-General) and not less than fourteen unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The present number of unofficial members is sixteen. Two of the unofficial members are members of the Council of Ministers, being appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council elects one of its unofficial members who is not a member of the Council of Ministers to be its President.

The House of Representatives consists of 32 members elected by adult suffrage from constituencies into which the Island is divided. At its first meeting the House elects one of its members to be Speaker. The Chief Minister and nine of the Ministers are appointed by the Governor from among its members. In the case of the Chief Minister, the name of the person whom it is proposed to appoint is submitted to the House for approval before appointment is made. The nine Ministers are appointed on the recommendation of the Chief Minister.

**Land Policy**

Appreciable areas of Government-owned lands, with the exception of Forest Reserves, have been disposed of under the existing Land Settlement Scheme, which is a freehold system of tenure. However, in recent years, experiments have been carried out under a leasehold scheme. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives. No land in the Island shall, however, be held by, or by any person in trust for or for the benefit of, the government of any foreign country, without a licence from the Governor in Council.

**Taxation**

The main heads of direct taxation are: Income tax, land and property tax, death duties—namely, (a) estate, (b) legacy and (c) succession duties—and the licence duty on motor vehicles and on other personal properties. Taxes on real properties are collected on the basis of the improved value. This is defined as the actual present gross value of the property.

Indirect taxation comprises Customs duties, excise duties, entertainment duty and certain licences and fees. Essential foodstuffs are either free of Customs duty or assessed at low rates. Several industries are granted duty-free admission of building materials, plant and equipment, under special incentive legislation.

**Development Plans**

In addition to approximately £1,250,000 carried over from the previous allocation, Jamaica has been given an allocation of £3,000,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act for the period 1955–60.

A new ten-year development plan entitled "A plan for Jamaica 1957–67" was published in January 1958. Modifications may be effected as...
development proceeds. The aggregate expenditure envisaged in the Plan is £78,844,000. This is distributed under the following Heads:

Contingencies 10%: £7,168,000

Further expenditure totalling £15,692,000 is also listed. This additional expenditure will be dependent upon the availability of revenue over the period.

Detailed Estimates of Expenditure have been outlined in the Plan in respect of the Financial Years 1957–58—1959–60. Over this period expenditure on Development is estimated to total approximately £26,152,075.

The sources from which it is anticipated this expenditure will be met are as follows:

| Source                        | Expenditure (£) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| General Revenue               | 9,165,548       |
| Colonial Development and Welfare Contributions | 2,792,645 |
| Loan Funds                    | 12,844,309      |

Total: £24,802,502

The difference of £1,349,573 will be financed from internal earnings of various special funds as well as balances already existing in these Funds.

Currency

British silver and cupro-nickel coins of all denominations circulate freely. Nickel and bronze alloy subsidiary coinage of 1d., ½d., and ¼d. denominations are in circulation. Jamaica Government currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1958, amounted to £8,408,622. Since July, 1955, currency notes of the British Caribbean Currency Board have been legal tender in Jamaica.

Education

The University College of the West Indies at Mona, near Kingston, has faculties of Medicine, Natural Sciences and Arts and a Department of Education. The total student enrolment for the academic year 1957–58 was 555 of which 245 were Jamaicans. Technical education is available at the Kingston Technical School which had 1,472 students in 1957 (533 day and 839 evening). The Government awarded 113 Scholarships for higher education in 1957 tenable at the University College of the West Indies, in the United Kingdom or Canada. Government offered other scholarships in collaboration with Colonial Development and Welfare. There were 95 Jamaicans with scholarships at Universities in the United Kingdom and others on awards made by religious and other bodies tenable at Universities in Canada and the United States. There was a total of 771 Jamaican students in the United States and 288 in Canada during the academic year 1957–58.

In 1957 there were 34 secondary schools with an enrolment of 9,511 and 744 primary schools with an enrolment of 245,163.

Expenditure on education (including educational services by the Local Authorities, etc.) in 1957 was £3,807,703 of which about £158,425 was contributed by the United Kingdom. In 1935 the expenditure was £226,392.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Jamaica Library Service operates a free Public Library Service for the Island. It is almost entirely financed by Government and is organized through a headquarters in Kingston, 13 Parish Libraries, 4 Branch Libraries and 88 Book centres.

In 1958 membership was 64,370 and the bookstock numbered 184,009 volumes. This bookstock is available to all readers through the use of a Union Catalogue maintained at Headquarters.

A Schools Library Service organized in conjunction with the Ministry of Education supplies 716 Primary Schools with books on a circulating basis. An improved Book-mobile service has just been inaugurated.

The Institute of Jamaica, a cultural centre of the Island, includes a general Lending and Reference Library, a West India Reference Library, two Junior Centres, the Jamaica School of Arts and Crafts and a Museum with galleries for natural history and the exhibition of arts and crafts. Extensive study collections are being developed in all branches of natural history.

Health

During 1957–58 the Government spent approximately £2,674,055 on its medical services, which are organized on an island-wide basis. This figure includes expenditure from the Sweepstake Fund, but excludes the cost of maintenance and construction of buildings, and the cost of operating the Bellevue (Mental) Hospital. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £191,207.

Disease rates compare favourably with more advanced countries nearby, e.g. the United States of America, and Canada. Among the colony's main diseases are: helminthiasis, yaws, malaria, venereal diseases and pulmonary tuberculosis. The island has recently suffered outbreaks of poliomyelitis and typhoid fever, the first epidemics for many years.

Each of the Island's 14 parishes has a full-time Medical Officer (Health), in charge of public health services, and a staff of public health inspectors, public health and district nurses. In the head office in Kingston are specialist officers who are responsible for the various phases of public health activities, which include epidemiology, health education, quarantine, public health nursing and control work in tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws, malaria and Industrial Health. There are four mobile health units which carry on a generalized public health programme in different areas.
The following are the government hospitals in Jamaica:

- 21 general hospitals (2,668 beds).
- Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital (110 beds and 110 cribs).
- George V Memorial Sanatorium for chest diseases (228 beds).
- Tuberculosis Hospital (180 beds).
- Mental Hospital (2,985 beds).
- Hansen Home for the treatment of leprosy (188 beds).

There are altogether 135 hospital outstations and dispensaries. The figure for out-patient attendance during 1957–58 was approximately 819,827.

The University College Hospital of the West Indies provides accommodation for 290 in-patients. It is proposed to increase the bed accommodation to 454. There are large Casualty and Out-patient Clinics.

A four-year Malaria Eradication Programme commenced in January 1958.

Communications

The international airports are at Palisadoes and Montego Bay. Government-owned internal airstrips are provided at Boscobel and Braco and there are fifteen private airstrips in the Island. A 3,000 ft. strip is under construction at Kingston. Completely new Airports are being built at Palisadoes and Montego Bay. On completion these will be modern airports able to accommodate the largest commercial aircraft.

Palisadoes Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Trans-Canada Air Lines, Avianca Airlines, Aerovias Panama and numerous non-scheduled operators.

Montego Bay Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, Avianca Airlines, Delta Airlines Incorporated, Avensa Airlines and Trans-Canada Air Lines.

Meteorological services are provided by the British Caribbean Meteorological Service, air traffic and associated services by the Civil Aviation Department and aeronautical telecommunications facilities and radio aids to navigation by International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited.

The Jamaica Government Railway has 208½ miles of main railway line and 37 miles of sidings. The main routes are:

(a) Kingston–Montego Bay.
(b) Kingston–Port Antonio.
(c) Kingston–Frankfield.
(d) Kingston–Linstead.

During the financial year 1957–58, the railway carried 1,254,141 passengers who paid £148,714, and 1,018,743 tons of freight from which £625,850 was earned. Over 64 miles of track have been laid in connexion with the operations of the bauxite companies now operating in Jamaica.

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring; the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the Island there are many bridges, culverts and sharp turns; the maximum gradients are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,658 miles of main roads, of which 1,037 miles are asphalted, the remainder being of waterbound macadamized surface; and about 4,438 miles of parochial roads, of which approximately 2,137 miles are suitable for motor traffic.

The principal ports are Kingston, Montego Bay and Port Antonio. Regular cargo and passenger services are maintained with the United Kingdom by Messrs. Elders and Fyffes, the Jamaica Banana Producers' Association, the Royal Mail Lines, the Harrison Lines, the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, the Sitmar Line and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company; with Canada by the Canadian National Steamship Company and Saguenay Terminals Limited; with the United States of America by the United Fruit Company, the Alcoa Steamship Company, the Three Bays Line and the Eastern Shipping Corporation; with the other British West Indian Islands by the S.S. Oluf Sven and S.S. Langreder operated by the Federal Government of the West Indies and Three Bays Line; with Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Bremen and Antwerp by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Company and with South America and Europe by Fratelli Grimaldi Line and Sicular Oceanic Lines; with India, Ceylon, Cape Town, Durban and Mauritius by the Nourse Line; with Australia and New Zealand by the New Zealand Shipping Company, Port Line, Shaw Savill and Albion Company and Ellerman, Bucknall Company Limited; with the Far East (Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines) by the de-la-Rama Steamship Lines. Bulk cargoes of petroleum products are imported from Trinidad and Aruba. During 1957 incoming cargo was estimated at 1,292,639 tons and outgoing at 5,353,066 tons.

Broadcasting

The Jamaica Broadcasting Company Limited operates a 17 hour a day commercial broadcasting service for the Island using medium wave and frequency modulation with a power of 5,000 watts. The Company also operates a wired broadcasting service in urban and suburban Kingston and in certain rural areas. There are approximately 15,000 subscribers. It is estimated that the radio and wired broadcasting audience is approximately 500,000. Ten per cent. of the Company's time is used by the Government of Jamaica and the Company relays several hours per week from the B.B.C.

Government is establishing a Statutory Broadcasting Corporation to be called the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation. The Corporation will operate partly on commercial lines and partly as a public service organization aimed at establishing the highest possible standards of broadcasting in Jamaica.

(a) Excludes Sugar Reserve Fund Contributions.
The Sugar Manufacturers' Association (comprising all the sugar manufacturers in Jamaica) provides the liaison between the sugar industry, the Government of Jamaica, and overseas interests. It deals with all aspects of the sugar industry, and sells co-operatively sugar for local consumption and all rum and other by-products.

As far as exports are concerned, during the war and up to 1952 when the British Ministry of Food purchased the entire exportable surplus, the Sugar Manufacturers' Association acted for the entire industry. The position now is that under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21st December, 1951, Jamaica is entitled from that year onwards, to a Global Quota, divided into a Negotiated Price Quota and a Free Quota. The former is now sold (as from 1st January, 1957) to the Sugar Board, set up under the United Kingdom Sugar Act, 1956, at prices annually negotiated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The latter is disposed of through commercial channels, as in the years before the war. There is also a small International Quota which is disposed of through commercial channels.

Through its subsidiaries, the Sugar Manufacturers' Association maintains substantial interests in firms engaged in the manufacture of commodities ancillary to the sugar industry, e.g.:

- Wholly owned subsidiaries—Jamaica Carbonics, Ltd.; Anhydrous Alcohol, Ltd.
- Minority share-holders-in—Jamaica Oxygen and Acetylene, Ltd.

The Citrus Growers' Association has full responsibility for the industry, and is the sole exporter of citrus, which is marketed co-operatively for its members. It operates a processing plant and packing house, which, together with independent processors and packers, obtain quotas of fresh fruits for packing and canning. These arrangements do not include limes, lemons and uglis.

The Banana Board was appointed on 1st October, 1953 under the Banana Board Law (Law 24 of 1953). The Board is the sole exporter of bananas and has wide powers over the industry.

On the 31st December, 1957, there were 189 Co-operative societies with 33,417 members, and total Share Capital of £252,028 registered under the Co-operative Societies Law. Of these, 91 were Credit Societies operating principally in the urban areas; 3 were Agricultural Credit Societies operating in the rural areas amongst farmers; 33 were Consumer Societies, including 13 Fishermen's Societies; and 41 were Producers', Marketing and Processing Societies; 3 were Irrigation Societies; 6 were Transport and Tillage Societies; 2 were Co-operative Farming Societies; 2 were Land Purchase Societies; 1 was a Cattle Insurance Society; 3 were Land Lease Societies; and 4 were Central Societies, 1 for Credit Societies in urban areas, 1 for Consumer Societies and the other 2 for Marketing Societies.

The Credit Societies made loans amounting to £475,960 and recovered £340,911 during the year. The value of goods/services sold in Consumer Societies was £236,267 and the value of produce marketed through Marketing Societies was £322,820, including produce marketed through the three Agricultural Credit Societies.

CAYMAN ISLANDS

Area
The Islands consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

Population
At the 1943 census the population was 6,670: Grand Cayman 5,311, Cayman Brac 1,296, Little Cayman 63. Roughly classified according to racial origin 1,052 were of African, 3,518 of mixed and 2,100 of European descent. The estimated population at the end of 1957 was 9,046.

Principal Towns
Georgetown and West Bay on Grand Cayman have populations of about 1,700 and 2,000 respectively.

Geographical Features
The principal island, Grand Cayman, is about 178 miles to the west of Jamaica. It is about 22 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to eight miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

Climate
From November to March it is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, and temperatures range from 60° to 75°. In the summer the range of temperature is some 10° higher and during certain periods mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown averages 60 inches per annum. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system. During 1956 a combined British and American weather station specifically for hurricane research was established on Grand Cayman.

History
The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1734. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for long a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1774 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 933, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

Constitution
The Government is administered by a Commissioner. Justices of the Peace (at present 27) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica, and these, with 27 elected members known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly of Justices and Vestry under the presidency of the Commissioner. Enactments are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica. The Legislature of Jamaica may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Cayman Islands and may amend or repeal any laws locally passed. The present constitution dates from 1832.

On the 20th February, 1958, the Royal Assent was given to the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands Act, 1958, by which Her Majesty was empowered to make provision by Order in Council for the government of the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is expected that the new constitution for the Cayman Islands will be brought into effect during 1959.

Land Policy
All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation
A poll tax of 8s. per adult male between the ages of 18 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 15% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

Public Finance

| Year   | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938-39| 13,253      | 11,859          |
| 1953-54| 64,854      | 75,284          |

| 1957-58*| 144,616    | 165,405         |

*(Revised Estimate.)

It is estimated that in 1957-58 £95,700 was derived from Customs receipts and £11,000 from the sale of postage stamps. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Treasury, Customs and Post Office £18,244, Education £13,823, Medical £18,091 and Public Works Recurrent £12,678.

The Public Debt as at 31st December, 1957, was as follows:

- Public Works Loan, 1932: outstanding £869.
- Reserve Funds at that date totalled £45,581.
Development

The Islands have, under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, an allocation of £70,000. A road improvement programme, which is estimated to cost £150,000, has been started; a grant of £40,000 from Colonial Development funds towards the cost has been approved. The construction of a new elementary school at Georgetown is planned.

In the last few years a number of hotels catering for tourists have been opened on Grand Cayman.

Education

There is compulsory free elementary education in 11 Government Schools; total enrolment in 1957 was 846 pupils. Estimated expenditure in 1957-58 amounted to £13,823 compared with £1,275 in 1938. There are two private Secondary Schools in Grand Cayman. One of them receives financial support from Government.

Libraries

There is a well-equipped public library in Georgetown, Grand Cayman.

Health

Estimated expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1957-58 was £18,091, compared with £1,091 in 1938. The hospital has accommodation for 28 patients. Medical Officers are seconded to the Dependency from Jamaica. A District surgeon, to whom a retainer from public funds is paid, has been in practice in Grand Cayman since December, 1957.

Communications

Owen Roberts airfield in Grand Cayman is used by B.W.I.A. and Lineas Aereas Costaricenses, S.A. There are regular air services between Grand Cayman and Kingston, Miami, San José (Costa Rica) and Panama City. A 2,220 ft. airstrip has been constructed in Cayman Brac and a regular service by light aircraft is in operation. A Nicaraguan Airline flying between Miami, Florida, and Managua, Nicaragua, stops at Grand Cayman for refuelling purposes.

A regular monthly steamship service is maintained between Kingston, Tampa (Florida) and all three islands. There is also more or less regular communication with Kingston, Florida and Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels.

Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, but no roads exist in Little Cayman.

Wireless stations are maintained by Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. There are no broadcasting services.

Principal Occupations

The chief industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment with overseas shipping companies. Their remittances to their families enable a standard of living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, but no unions have been registered. There is no unemployment.

Crops and Products

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone soil. The main export products of importance are turtle and thatch rope. The manufacture of thatch rope was at one time the mainstay of the poorer people, but the industry is now in decline.

THE WEST INDIES—JAMAICA : TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

Area
The Turks Islands Bank and the Caicos Bank cover an area of approximately 75 by 50 miles to the south-east of the Bahama Islands. The total land area is estimated at 166 square miles.

Population
The total population is estimated at 6,600.

Principal Towns
The towns and largest settlement are Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour (South Caicos) and Bottle Creek (North Caicos), with estimated populations of 1,800, 600 and 1,400 respectively.

Geographical Features
The Turks Islands consist of two inhabited islands, Grand Turk and Salt Cay, six uninhabited cays, and a large number of rocks. The principal islands of the Caicos group are South Caicos, East Caicos, Middle (or Grand) Caicos, North Caicos, Providenciales and West Caicos. Geographically the islands are a part of the Bahama chain and have the same flat characteristics, there being no land above 250 feet. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by a 20-mile stretch of ocean water known as the Turks Islands passage; the Caicos Islands are surrounded by a shallow water reef. The islands generally are arid and stony.

Climate
The south-east trade winds blow constantly throughout the year, giving an equable and healthy climate. Rainfall is variable and tends to be higher in the Caicos Islands; on Grand Turk the annual average is about 25 inches. The temperature ranges throughout the year from 60° to 90°. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1926, 1928 and 1945.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable and Wireless Limited at Grand Turk.

History
The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the Southern States of America after the War of Independence. After the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, their former slaves remaining in possession. In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, but in 1848 a separate charter was granted to the islands divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas. After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 petitioned Her Majesty that the islands might be annexed to the Colony of Jamaica and from 1874 to the present time they have been one of its dependencies.

In 1953 the United States Government completed a Guided Missiles Observer Station at Grand Turk, under an extension of the Bahamas Agreement.

A United States Government Naval Facility for Oceanographic Measurement was established at Grand Turk in 1954.

Constitution
An Order in Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica made provision for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. This Board now consists of four official and eight unofficial members. Elections, based on adult suffrage, were held for the unofficial seats for the first time in 1953. The Commissioner is ex officio President of the Board, which has full legislative and budgetary powers, but ordinances require the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming law. Laws passed by the Legislature of Jamaica do not apply to the Dependency unless they are made applicable in express terms. The revenues and expenditure are independent of those of Jamaica.

On the 20th February, 1958 the Royal Assent was given to the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands Act, 1958, by which Her Majesty was empowered to make provision by Order in Council for the government of the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands. It is expected that the new constitution for the Turks and Caicos Islands will be brought into operation during 1959.

Land Policy
Much of the land on the salt islands is held on private freehold title. The law limiting the rights of aliens to own land was repealed in 1953.

Taxation
The main heads of taxation are Customs import duties (15% preferential and 20% general f.o.b.) and a special tax of 4% on all dutiable goods. There is no direct taxation.

| Year   | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39| 9,780       | 13,830          |
| 1952–53| 78,389      | 78,760          |
| 1953–54| 73,103      | 64,047          |
| 1954–55| 84,857      | 89,289          |
| 1955–56| 95,310      | 94,569          |
| 1956–57| 100,995(a)  | 89,379          |

(a) The Revenue 1956–57 includes £40,000 grant-in-aid from Her Majesty's Government.

The Dependency's Financial Year now ends on December 31st, the Revenue and Expenditure for the nine months' period April to December, 1957, being revised at £94,004 (which includes £18,000 grant-in-aid) and £99,236 respectively.

In 1958 the Revenue inclusive of grant-in-aid of £35,142 and C. D. & W. Grants of £69,746 is estimated at the Expenditure figure of £171,699.

The main source of local revenue in 1956–57 was £33,875 from Customs. The main heads of expenditure in the same year were:—Commissioner's Department £9,422, Medical Department £9,877, Education £6,850, Unemployment Relief £13,030.

Currency
The currency in circulation is Jamaica notes and British silver of all denominations.

Development Plans
The islands have received allocations totalling £95,000, under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act. Of this amount £25,000 has been spent on improvement of water supplies in Grand Turk and £40,000 on the Salt Industry. Assistance has also been given for teachers' refresher courses, and towards the cost of a sloop service with the other islands, to back a guarantee for the air service with the islands, as well as for several other minor projects.

Education
There are 13 Government Elementary Schools, one with a Senior Section, in the Dependency. In 1957 there were some 1,205 pupils on the rolls.
and the average attendance was 892. Expenditure on education during 1956–57 amounted to £6,850 compared with £840 in 1935.

Libraries

There is a public library at Grand Turk.

Health

There is a 16-bed cottage hospital of modern design at Grand Turk, together with a dental clinic. Medical officers, seconded from Jamaica, are stationed at Grand Turk and at Cockburn Harbour on South Caicos. There is a clinic at Cockburn Harbour and a maternity clinic at Bottle Creek on North Caicos. Expenditure on medical services in 1956–57 was £9,877, compared with £990 in 1935. Half the salaries of all trained staff is now contributed by the Jamaica Government.

Communications

There are airfields at Grand Turk and South Caicos. The former is a military airstrip constructed by the United States Government in connexion with the Guided Missile Project. A weekly air service with Nassau was begun in 1956. There is a fortnightly mail, freight and passenger service to Jamaica by sea and ships call occasionally from England and the United States.

Grand Turk is an important junction of cables to Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda. A radio telephone system connects Grand Turk with Salt Cay and the Caicos as well as providing a service with Jamaica and the United States.

There is no broadcasting service but Cable and Wireless Limited broadcast a five minute daily programme of news and announcements.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of the Turks Islands group and of South Caicos are normally engaged in the production (by solar evaporation) and shipping of salt. A grant of £35,200 was made from Colonial Development and Welfare funds during 1958 to provide modern loading facilities. The remainder of the Caicos population are mainly fishermen, and do a limited amount of subsistence agriculture. A large proportion of the male population is usually absent from home working in the Bahamas lumber camps, the Inagua salt works or as crews on merchant ships.

Main Crops and Products

Sisal is grown under conditions of peasant agriculture in the Caicos Islands, but the quality is poor, owing to the absence of fresh water for retting and washing. Salt is the main product of the Dependency. Crawfish are exported frozen to Florida, and conchs are sold dried in Haiti.

Area

The Leeward Islands, which comprise the four Colonies of Antigua, St. Christopher–Nevis–Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands, have a total area of about 420 square miles.

Geographical Features

The islands belong partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. Anguilla, Sombrero and the British Virgin Islands lie apart, to the north and north-west. St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat and Redonda form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, and Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.
Population

The total population of the Leeward Islands at the 1946 census and the estimated population at 31st December, 1957, are shown in the following table:

| British Virgin Islands | 6,505  | 7,760    |
| **Total**      | 108,838| 135,635  |

Climate

The climate of the islands varies slightly, but is usually dry and healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average annual rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from June to October; the rainy season from July to December.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493 and became British during the seventeenth century. From the outset they have been associated geographically and politically. They were colonized from St. Kitts, were all included in the Caribbe grant, and first enjoyed a common Legislature as far back as 1674. That Legislature (or General Assembly, as it was called) did not, for various reasons, meet for many years and was finally abolished in 1798, but not before passing a humane slave amelioration Act.

By the Leeward Islands Act of 1871, enacted by the Imperial Parliament, there was created a single Colony of the Leeward Islands consisting of five Presidencies, namely, Dominica (which became a Colony of the Windward Islands on 1st January 1940), Antigua, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands. Provision was made for the establishment of an Executive Council and a General Legislative Council of the Leeward Islands. Members of the General Legislative Council were drawn from the Presidential Legislatures and by 1953 there was a majority of elected members on the Council. The General Legislature had concurrent legislative powers with the local Legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act but any enactment by a Presidential Legislature on such subjects was void if repugnant to an enactment of the General Legislative Council.

The British Standing Closer Association Committee in its report of 1948–49 recommended that each of the Leeward Islands should enter the proposed new British Caribbean Federation as a separate unit, instead of entering as a federation. This view was accepted and, for this and other reasons, it was decided to defederate the Leeward Islands. This took place on the 1st July, 1956, and each of the four Presidencies then became a Colony, and the Federal Executive Council and General Legislative Council automatically disappeared.

The Colonies of Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla and Montserrat have joined The West Indies federation, but the Colony of the British Virgin Islands has decided not to do so.

Administration.

There is a Governor of the Leeward Islands who is normally resident in Antigua, though he spends several months in each year visiting the other islands. He is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Leeward Islands. The Government of each Colony is administered by a resident Administrator, who is subject to instructions from the Governor.

A Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward and Leeward Islands were established in 1939. The Federal Supreme Court constituted by Article 73 of the Constitution of The West Indies also has certain original and appellate jurisdiction.

The Leeward Islands’ Police Force continues to be a “federal” Force common to all the Leeward Islands despite the defederation of the Leeward Islands Colony.

There is also a common audit system for the four Colonies.

Antigua

Area
The area of Antigua is 108 square miles, the Dependency of Barbuda 62 square miles, the Dependency of Redonda (uninhabited) half a square mile. Barbuda lies 25 miles to the north, Redonda 25 miles to the south-west of the main island.

Population
The population at the 1946 census numbered 41,757; at 31st December, 1957 it was estimated to number 55,967.

Principal Town
St. John's, the capital, has a population of about 11,800.

Geographical Features
The western part of the island of Antigua is composed entirely of volcanic rocks (highest point Boggy Peak, 1,330 feet). The eastern and northern parts are of limestone, below 500 feet above sea level, and a central plain stretches diagonally across the island. Barbuda is very flat with a large lagoon on the west side. There are no rivers.

History
The first settlers were a few English who arrived in 1632. In 1663 Charles II made a formal grant to Lord Willoughby, who at once proceeded to send out large numbers of colonists. For a short time the island was in French occupation, but in 1667 it was declared an English possession in terms of the Treaty of Breda and has remained British from that date.

Constitution
The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Administrator, two official members and five unofficial members (one nominated member and four elected members). The Governor, and in his absence the Administrator, presides over the Executive Council. In January 1956 the ministerial system was introduced whereby three of the elected members of the Legislative Council having seats in the Executive Council hold portfolios as Ministers for Trade and Production, Public Works and Communications, and Social Services.

The Legislative Council, as reconstituted in December 1951, is composed of the Administrator as President, two official members, three nominated and eight elected members. A Deputy President is elected by the unofficial members of the Council from among their number.

Land Policy
Land may not be alienated or leased to aliens without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, alien occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. There is a small amount of Crown land which, when not used for public purposes, may be leased or sold.

Taxation
The main forms of taxation are income tax, trade tariffs and excise duties. The rates of individual income tax range from 2½ cents to 65 cents per $ of chargeable income. Company tax is 40% of chargeable income.

Provision has been made for double taxation relief with the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and consideration is being given to extending the arrangements to other countries.

St. Christopher, discovered by Columbus on his second voyage in 1493, was the first island in the West Indies to be colonized by the English, when Sir Thomas Warner took settlers there in 1623. In 1624 the French, under d’Ennambuc, also colonized one-half of the island.

After a severe battle with the Europeans in about 1626, the Caribs, the native people of the island, were driven out in 1629.

Intermittent warfare between the French and British settlers during the seventeenth century ravaged the economy of the island. It was, however, ceded to Britain by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The last fighting on the island took place in 1782 when the French captured Brimstone Hill after a memorable siege, and once more took possession of St. Christopher. The island was finally restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

Nevis, also sighted by Columbus on his second voyage, was settled by the English in 1628 and soon became one of the most prosperous of the Antilles. Although it suffered from French and Spanish attacks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it maintained a sound economic position until the middle of the nineteenth century.

Columbus probably also first sighted Anguilla. The island remained continuously British after its colonization in 1650 but was subject in its early days to severe depredations by marauders, free-booters and pirates.

Constitution

The Executive Council for the Colony consists of the Governor, the Administrator, two official members, five elected members (one to represent Nevis) and one nominated member.

Under an Ordinance of 1952 the Legislative Council comprises the Administrator (President), two ex officio members, eight elected members and three nominated members. An elected majority in the Legislative Council is thus provided for.

In January 1956 the system was introduced whereby three of the elected members of the Legislative Council having seats in the Executive Council hold portfolios as Ministers for Trade and Production, Public Works and Communications, and Social Services.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot own land except under licence from the Governor.

Taxation

The main taxes in force are Customs duty and Income tax. Income tax rates range from 6d. in the £ to 15s. in the £ upon the chargeable income of an individual. Companies pay a flat rate of 8s. in the £.

| 1957           | 4,779   | 5,116       |

The main sources of revenue in 1957 were Customs $1,686,341 and Internal Revenue $1,512,112.
In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Peasant Development $506,803; Public Works Extraordinary $125,708; Hospitals, Dispensaries, etc. $486,559; Medical and Health $346,104; Education $523,325. The Public Debt at 31st December, 1957, was $987,739; deposits in the Government Savings Bank amounted to $1,028,218.

Currency

The currency in circulation is a West Indian currency issued by the Board of the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern group), consisting of Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. Currency notes are of denominations $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100. British coin is legal tender but the chief medium of circulation is the new British Caribbean coin in denominations of 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents, 1 cent and a ½ cent. The West Indian $ is fixed at 4s. 2d., that is $4·80 to £1 sterling.

Development Plans

The Five-Year Development Plan which was drawn up in 1955 for the period 1955-60 was revised in 1956. The new plan envisaged expenditure of $4,641,000 during the remainder of the Development period; of this sum $2,033,000 is to come from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, $2,381,000 from loans and $227,000 from local resources. The Development funds were allocated as follows: Trade and Production $273,000, Communications and Works, $3,759,000, Social Services $609,000. In 1958 a further amount of $456,000 was allocated to the colony from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, and the Development Plan has since been further revised to take account of this.

Education

In 1957, there were 33 Government primary schools (St. Kitts 17, Nevis 11, Anguilla 5) 1 denominational primary school in St. Kitts which receives a Government grant, and eight unaided primary schools. The total enrolment was 12,377. Five secondary schools (Government 4, private 1) had an enrolment of 756 pupils. Government expenditure on educational services for 1957 was $523,325 compared with $44,952 in 1938.

Libraries

There are three main public libraries in the Colony, one in each island with headquarters in St. Kitts, and subsidiary book distribution points throughout the islands. Book circulation amounts to over 51,000 volumes annually.

Health

The total expenditure on medical and health services in 1957 was $795,630 compared with $96,864 in 1938. A free grant of £513 was made available for the training of two Public Health Inspectors in Jamaica. In 1957, beds available in two general hospitals totalled 156; those in two cottage hospitals, 24. There were 22 Health Centres and Outposts at work in the Colony. Their chief functions are to improve standards of nutrition, to promote maternal and child health, to improve environmental sanitation, to control tuberculosis, venereal disease and yaws and to educate the community in health matters. There are also a tuberculosis ward and a leprosarium.

Communications

One airport, about two miles north of Basseterre by road, serves the island of St. Kitts. The runway is 4,125 feet by 300 feet and lies in a west-east direction. It is proposed to lengthen this to 5,600 feet.

A landing strip has been opened in Anguilla, thereby allowing L.I.A.T. (a subsidiary of B.W.I.A.) to operate a service linking that island with the other Leeward Islands.

A landing strip and terminal building at Nevis have now been constructed thus linking each island in the Colony by air communications. This work was largely financed from a Colonial Development and Welfare grant.

A converted MTB 112, owned by the Government, is run as a commercial undertaking between the islands of the Colony. Voyages to the Sombrero Light Station are also undertaken.

The main road round the island of St. Kitts has been completely resurfaced. Grants have been received under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act for road reconstruction programmes in the three islands, and work on these programmes is in progress.

Principal Occupations

The staple industry is sugar and about 7,500 persons are employed on estates or in the sugar factory at Basseterre. In Nevis there is a high percentage of peasant ownership of land and, apart from the cultivation of sugar cane, sea island cotton of good quality is grown in large quantities for export. In Anguilla, where the majority of the inhabitants are peasant proprietors, the main industries are livestock raising, salt production and fishing.

There are three organizations registered under the Trade Union Act, with a total membership of 5,485. The largest is the St. Kitts-Nevis Trades and Labour Union, membership 5,225.

Main Crops and Products

These are sugar, sea island cotton and salt.

Livestock number (to the nearest 500):—cattle 6,500, sheep 7,000, goats 4,000, pigs 3,500.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

In Nevis, the marketing of peasants' canes, sea island cotton and other produce, such as maize, is handled by the Government Marketing Department. Marketing of sugar is done by the St. Kitts (Basseterre) Sugar Factory through its London agents. This factory also provides storage space for sugar and molasses.

Trinidad and Tobago

Area

The total area of the Colony is 1,980 square miles (Trinidad 1,864, Tobago 116).

Population

This was estimated to number 764,900 at mid-1957. The majority are natives of the West Indies, of African and East Indian descent. The racial groups at the 1946 census were: African 47%, East Indian 35%, Mixed or Coloured 14%, European 3%, Chinese 1%. English is spoken generally throughout the Colony.

Principal Towns

| Population |
|------------|
| Port of Spain (capital) | 120,650 |
| San Fernando | 38,850 |
| Arima | 12,050 |

Geographical Features

Trinidad is traversed by two mountain ranges, the northern and southern ranges, running roughly east and west, and a third, the central range, running diagonally across the island. Between the northern and central ranges the land is flat and well-watered; south of the central range it is undulating and the water supply poor. Apart from a comparatively small area in the northern range (main peaks: Cerro del Aripo 3,085 feet, El Tucuche 3,072 feet) and Mount Tamana (1,009 feet) in the central range, all the land is below 1,000 feet. The rivers, though numerous, are unimportant. A main ridge of hills, 18 miles in length, extends nearly two-thirds of the length of Tobago from its north-eastern extremity. The highest point is 1,890 feet. About 300,000 acres, or 22%, of the total area of the Colony, is under forest.

Climate

The climate is tropical. There is a dry season from January to the middle of May with an average rainfall of 3·8–5·2 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December (with a short break in September) with an average of 5·7–11·4 inches per month. The average annual rainfall ranges from 71 inches in the west to 101 inches in the east. The mean temperature in 1956 was 81·5°F. The coolest months of the year are December to April.

History

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus on his third voyage in 1498 and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalized his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant in 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of representations made to the Court of Madrid as to its exceptional fertility, a royal proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to Catholics of all nations to settle in Trinidad. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, soon augmented by many French families driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the events of the French Revolution; and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

In 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His
Majesty's forces. In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

Tobago was also discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the Darling and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when some 300 Zealander were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of a year or two these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsius procured letters patent from Louis XIV creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral D'Estrées to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis XIV restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1682, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral, the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to Great Britain in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. In 1793, it was captured by a British force and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802; again reconquered in 1803 by a British force; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad in 1888 and in 1898 became a ward of the united colony of Trinidad and Tobago.

Constitution

The constitution of 1956 provides for a unicameral Legislature with an elected majority, a Chief Minister, a Minister of Finance and an elected Speaker to preside over the Council. In addition, it provides for the appointment of a Public Service Commission and a separate Police Service Commission and Police Promotions Board. The Executive Council is the chief instrument of policy and, with certain exceptions, the Governor is required to consult with it in the exercise of his powers and to act in accordance with its advice.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor as Chairman, a Chief Minister, two ex officio members (Colonial Secretary and Attorney General) and seven members elected by the Legislative Council. The election of the Chief Minister or any other of the last-named members may be revoked by a two-thirds vote of the Legislative Council. The Governor, on the advice of the Chief Minister, may charge elected members of the Executive Council with the administration of any government department or subject (other than the subject of finance which he is required to assign to an elected member) which, in his discretion, he has declared may be assigned to elected members. Those so appointed are styled "Ministers".

The Legislative Council consists of an elected Speaker, a Chief Minister, two ex officio members (Colonial Secretary and Attorney-General), five nominated members and twenty-four elected members, including the Chief Minister and the Speaker (if elected from the Council). In the present Executive Council the eight elected members have been charged with the administration of Finance, Planning and Development (Chief Minister); Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; Works and Transport; Education and Culture; Health, Water and Sanitation; Housing and Local Government; Labour, Co-operative Development and Social Services; and Industry, Commerce, Tourism and External Communications.

Adult suffrage was introduced in 1946. The first general election under the 1956 constitution was held on 24th September, 1956, and 80% out of a total electorate of 338,225 voted.

In September 1957 and in June 1958, the Legislative Council passed certain resolutions in favour of further constitutional reform which will bring the territory to the threshold of full internal self-government.

Land Policy

Policy with regard to land in the Colony was modified in 1941 when the sale of Crown lands was discontinued. Leases are now granted with covenants designed to assure full and proper development of the land. The period for which leases for agricultural purposes are granted is 25 years, with an option to renew for a further 25 years. The leases also contain provision for compensating the lessees for unexhausted improvements, and for penalties for dilapidation of Government-owned buildings. Land may be compulsorily acquired by the Crown for public purposes subject to the payment of compensation.

Taxation

Under the Customs tariff taxation takes the form of specific and ad valorem duties, with British preferential and general tariff rates. There is also an export duty on asphalt of $1·20 per ton (crude), $1·66 per ton (refined) and $1·20 per ton asphalt cement. Excise duties are levied on petrol (18 cents per imperial gallon), beer, potable spirits and spirituous preparations, deodorized edible oil, lard substitute, matches, and liquefied gases (propane and butane).

Under the Income Tax Ordinance the income of a resident individual which exceeds the allowances to which he is entitled is taxed at rates varying from 6 cents in every dollar of the first $1,000 to 90 cents in every dollar of incomes in excess of $66,000. The deductible allowances are (a) personal $1,200, (b) wife $480 ($720 if she is employed and receives emoluments totalling $240 or over), child $240 or (if the child is educated in the Colony but away from home) actual expenses for board and lodging and tuition not exceeding $60.
or (if the child is educated abroad) actual expenses not exceeding $1,200, (d) dependent relative $200, (e) house-keeper $200, (f) insurance premiums not exceeding one-sixth of income. Life assurance companies are taxed at 15% of their profits and other companies at 40%. Other main heads of taxation include estate duties, lands and buildings taxes, a sweepstake tax, a pool betting tax, a cinema entertainment tax, and a motor vehicle purchase tax.

| Public Finance | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
|               | $       | $           |
| 1938          | 13,445,000 | 12,230,000 |
| 1953          | 68,100,681 | 66,609,901 |
| 1954          | 73,634,817 | 73,740,476 |
| 1955          | 81,943,618 | 79,347,280 |
| 1956          | 88,468,218 | 86,203,270 |
| 1957          | 101,610,027 | 90,158,952 |

In 1957 it was estimated that 42% ($43 million) of revenue was derived from Income Tax and 28% ($29.2 million) from Customs and excise duties.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Public Debt $5 million; social services (including health, education and old age pensions) $24.2 million; works and hydraulics extraordinary and annually recurrent $10.5 million; railways and telegraphs $2.3 million; subventions $8.2 million; and police $5.4 million.

The Public Debt at the end of 1957 amounted to $72.8 million ($95.26 per head) of which $12.3 million was issued locally and $60.5 million in the United Kingdom. The Colony's surplus balances at 31st December, 1957, stood at $55.5 million.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group), on behalf of Barbados, British Guiana, Leeward Islands, Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. It consists of notes of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100 denominations and British Caribbean coins of 1 cent, 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents and 50 cents denominations. United Kingdom silver and bronze coins, however, remain legal tender until demonetized. Currency notes issued by the Government of Jamaica are legal tender in the Eastern Group of British Caribbean Colonies and currency notes issued by the Currency Board of the Eastern Group of Colonies are similarly legal tender in Jamaica. The total value of currency notes in circulation in Trinidad and Tobago at the end of 1957 amounted to $32,711,229 and the total value of British Caribbean coin amounted to $1,441,125, at the rate of $1 for 4s. 2d.

Development Plans

Trinidad and Tobago received an allocation of $4,800,000 under the Development and Welfare Act of 1945, as a contribution towards a development plan. The estimated unallocated balance of this sum at 31st December, 1955, was $2,171,515. The Secretary of State has agreed to make this balance available during the life of the new Act covering the period 1955-60. In addition, a further allocation of $1,200,000 was approved under the Development and Welfare Act of 1955.

The present Government, returned at the elections of September 1956, have radically revised their predecessors' development plans. In December 1957, the Chief Minister introduced a new Five-Year Development Programme covering the years 1958-62. The total estimated expenditure is $191.3 million, to be raised from the following sources:

| Source                  | Amount |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Contributions from revenue | 101.3  |
| Surplus on 1957 working   | 8.5    |
| Local loans              | 8.0    |
| Unspent balance of C.D. and W. grants | 3.4    |
| Various funds and short-term loans | 19.4   |
| Uncovered balance        | 50.7   |
| **Total**                | **191.3** |

Additional revenue will be raised principally in three ways:
(i) by reducing income tax evasion;
(ii) by increasing taxation on a few important commodities;
(iii) by changing the legislation dealing with oil leases and oil taxation.

The financing of the uncovered balance of $50.7 million depends largely on the outcome of negotiations with the oil companies.

The Programme places great emphasis on the improvement of public utilities, especially roads, electricity and water supplies, and on other measures for the encouragement of basic industries. Special attention is given to the development of Tobago.

Other Development

The Aid to Pioneer Industries Ordinance, 1950, provides for the granting of specific reliefs from Customs duty and income tax to persons establishing new industries in the Colony. In 1951 the Rugby Portland Cement Company Limited, in association with the Colonial Development Corporation, set up the Trinidad Cement Company Limited, with a capital of $8,000,000, to undertake the manufacture of cement. During 1957 the following "Pioneer Industries" were declared:
- Manufacture of baking powder, specialized cement, children's dresses, coconut shell flour, curry powder, enamelware and galvanized hollowware, upper leather, metal building components and precast modular building units of light weight concrete.

Education

Primary education in the Colony is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 15 resident within two miles of a Government or assisted school. No pupil is retained on the roll of a primary school after attaining the age of 15. Secondary schools prepare pupils for the Cambridge school certificate and higher school certificate examinations. On the results of the latter, five university scholarships are awarded annually by Government.

On the 31st December, 1957, there were 408 primary and intermediate schools (66 Government primary, two Government intermediate, 334 assisted primary, and six assisted intermediate) with a total enrolment of 160,011. There were also 10,883 pupils enrolled in 146 private primary schools.

There were 41 secondary schools (2 Government, 17 assisted and 22 private) with a total enrolment of 13,778 (9,090 Government and assisted, including 220 students at the technical...
institute and 4,688 private). A Board of Industrial Training conducts evening classes at ten different centres distributed throughout the territory. These are attended by some 4,000 evening class students and the students are prepared for the Trade examinations of the City and Guilds of London Institute. The Board also co-operates with the larger oil companies and sugar companies in conducting in-service training in well-equipped trade training centres. The services of an itinerant teacher are also at the disposal of these companies.

A Government Technical College at San Fernando was opened during 1954. The Department of Education conducts evening classes for adults and the Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies (situated in Jamaica) provides a programme of classes at an intermediate university level. There were over 1,630 students from the Colony studying at universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Jamaica. Net expenditure on education (including school buildings) was $11,621,606 in 1957 as compared with $956,000 in 1938.

Libraries

The Central Library of Trinidad and Tobago has headquarters in Port of Spain, regional branches at San Fernando and Scarborough (Tobago) and several other branch libraries. There is also a Trinidad Public (Free) Library at Port of Spain and a Carnegie Free Library at San Fernando. In 1957, 750,133 books were circulated through libraries.

Health

There are four general hospitals, a mental, a leprosy, and a tuberculosis hospital, seven district hospitals and a tuberculosis sanatorium, a leprosarium and two houses of refuge, with a total of 3,756 beds. In 1957 the daily average number of beds occupied in Port of Spain and San Fernando Hospitals was 585 and the total number of patients treated was 45,262. Health centres and rural dispensaries are maintained in the townships and in the larger villages. A public health programme is administered through the following divisions and units: malaria, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, leprosy, yaws, hookworm, nutrition, health education, maternity and infant welfare, and environmental sanitation as carried out by local authorities.

The principal causes of death during 1957 were (apart from old age):—diseases of early infancy; heart diseases—chronic, rheumatic, arteriosclerotic and degenerative, etc.; vascular lesions affecting central nervous system; malignant neoplasms (cancer); gastroenteritis and colitis; bronchitis and tuberculosis of the respiratory system; nephritis.

The expenditure by the Health Department in 1957 was $11,322,070 compared with $1,000,000 in 1938.

Communications

The main airfields are at Piarco, 12 miles from Port of Spain (Trinidad), and Crown Point (Tobago). Ten airlines (British West Indian Airways, Pan American Airways, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Aerovias Brasil, Aerolineas Argentinas, Trans-Canada Airlines, St. Vincent Government Air Service, Air France and British Overseas Airways Corporation) maintain scheduled operations through Piarco. British West Indian Airways provides daily communication between Trinidad and Tobago. In 1957 at Piarco there were 11,176 aircraft movements; 79,120 passengers arrived and 1,757,400 lbs. of mail and cargo were unladen. A meteorological station is maintained by the British Caribbean Meteorological Service at Piarco.

There are 109 miles of Government railway. In 1957 over 3,724,000 passengers and 357,000 tons of goods were carried. The ancillary services of the Trinidad Government were terminated on 31st March, 1954, and handed over to private enterprise.

There are 3,970 miles of roads; 2,783 miles suitable for wheeled traffic, 1,187 miles of bridle roads.

Trinidad is well served by steamship lines; these include the Alcoa, American President, American Pioneer, American Republics, Argentine Star, Blue Star, Booth, Canadian National, Cunard White Star, Elders and Fyffes, French Furness, Harrison, Louis Dreyfus, Moore-McCormack, New Zealand, Norgeuf, Nourse, Royal Mail, Royal Netherlands, Saguenay Terminals, Surinam and Venezuelan lines. During 1957, 6,388 ships entered the harbour with a total tonnage of 18,349,000 while 6,377 ships cleared harbour with a total tonnage of 18,199,000.

Broadcasting

The Trinidad Broadcasting Company Limited operates “Radio Trinidad” on the following frequencies:

(a) 730 k/cs. (410·9 metres) 20 Kw. Two 10 Kw. paralleled transmitters are located in Caroni;

(b) 95·1 m/cs. FM-250 watts located in Port of Spain.

Radio Distribution (Trinidad) Limited operates a wired broadcasting service from Port of Spain to Arima and in San Fernando. The service offers two programmes one of which consists of a relay of the “Radio Trinidad” broadcasts.

There are 17,500 subscribers with an estimated five listeners per set.

The Trinidad Publishing Company Limited operates “Radio Guardian” on the following frequencies:

(a) 610 k/cs. (481·9 metres) 10 Kw. The transmitter is located at Chaguanas together with a standby transmitter of 1 Kw.

(b) 98·9 m/cs. FM-250 watts located in Port of Spain.

In 1957 a total of 37,814 receiving licences were issued.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is dependent on agriculture. A rough estimate of the numbers in the main occupations at April 1957, is: agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting 63,200; mining and quarrying 14,000; manufacturing 47,400; construction and electricity, gas, water supply and sanitary services 30,400; commerce 29,600; transport, storage and communications 23,500; government, community, and personal and recreative services 58,200.

In December, 1957, there were 80 trade unions with a membership of 45,042.
Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are sugar and by-products (molasses and rum), cocoa, coconuts and coconut products, citrus and by-products, rubber, coffee, tonka beans and bananas. Ground provisions, maize and rice are also grown for local consumption. Copra is now mostly processed locally into edible oil, coconut oil, lard compound, margarine, butter substitute and laundry soap.

The estimated livestock population is as follows; cattle 66,700; water buffaloes 6,000; goats 56,000; sheep 10,000; horses 1,800; mules 3,000; donkeys 3,000; poultry over 2,500,000 (this total fluctuates); and swine over 63,800.

The outturn of timber from the forest in 1957 was 3,166,000 cubic feet, split wood 329,000 cubic feet and firewood 1,285,000 cubic feet. There were 77 licensed sawmills.

There is extensive fishing in coastal waters but the catch is insufficient to meet demand. Experiments are being carried out in fishpond culture.

Crude petroleum and natural gas are produced in the southern part of Trinidad. Foreign crude oil is also imported from Venezuela, the refined products being re-exported. The (asphalt) "Pitch Lake", 109 acres in extent, is at La Brea; 135,940 tons of natural asphalt were produced in 1957.

In addition to the two main industries of oil and sugar, the island is the world's only supplier of Angostura bitters. Its manufactures also include bricks and tiles, paint, cement, shirts, pyjamas, shoes, boots, furniture, soap, matches, cigarettes, beer, aerated waters, biscuits, chocolate, confectionery, ice, stock feed, glass, time-recording clocks and equipment, bay rum, drugs and industrial gases. Printing, foundry work, ship and aircraft repair are also carried on.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

A statutory Marketing Board is charged with assisting and improving the marketing and processing of agricultural and fishery produce in the interests of producers and in particular with assisting co-operative societies to dispose of their produce to the best advantage. The Board also controls the export of gros michel bananas. The other agricultural products are marketed mainly through producer associations within the framework of agreements such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, (Coconut) Oil and Fats Agreement, or through normal commercial channels, e.g. rum, bitters, coffee.

In 1957 there were 438 agricultural credit societies with a membership of 15,933; 73 co-operative societies with approximately 6,690 members and total assets of $4,818,180; 265 credit unions with 25,000 members and total assets of $2,350,000; and 351 friendly societies with 131,465 members and liquid and invested funds amounting to $2,309,321.12.

The Windward Islands

Area
The total area of the Islands is 826 square miles.

Population
At the end of 1957 the total population was about 328,625. The majority are of the negro race; less than 5% are white. There are a few persons of East Indian descent, and a few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica.

Principal Towns
The capitals of the four colonies and their estimated populations are:
Grenada—St. George's (residence of Governor) 5,772*
Dominica—Roseau 13,500
St. Lucia—Castries 25,000
St. Vincent—Kingstown 7,000
* 1946 Census.

Geographical Features
The islands are of volcanic origin and the more sheltered coasts are fringed by reefs. Torrential streams from the more rugged areas tend to lose their gradient nearer the coast and the deposition of their sediments has led to the formation of fertile river flats and occasional river terraces. The residual clays in the rugged volcanic areas are comparatively fertile. One of the volcanoes in the Windward region (St. Vincent) was active in 1902. At the Soufrières of Dominica and St. Lucia and in parts of Grenada hot sulphuretted gases still emerge and there are numerous hot springs which contain salts.

Climate
The prevailing trade winds provide a delightful climate; there is little variation between night and day.

History
As early as 1763 one Governor was appointed for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government. On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad. On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

Constitution and Administration
Each of the four colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada, where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Windward Islands. The government of each colony is administered by a resident Administrator subject to instructions from the Governor. There is no common Legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. Each colony has a Legislative Council presided over by the Administrator, in which the majority of members are elected by universal adult suffrage; and each colony has an Executive Council which may be summoned and consulted by either the Governor or the Administrator. A Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established in 1939. The Federal Supreme Court constituted by Article 73 of the Constitution of The West Indies also has certain original and appellate jurisdiction. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889. In March, 1956, revised constitutions were introduced in each of the four islands.

Land Policy
There is a small amount of Crown land reserved mainly for purposes of forest and water conservation. There is no restriction on the transfer of land except to aliens, for which the consent of the Governor in Executive Council is necessary.

Currency
The currency comprises dollar notes (West Indian $1 = 4s. 2d.) and coinage. Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, and Trinidad) in currency unification. Coins in denominations of 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent were introduced by the Board in 1955.

Legislation has been enacted in the Windward Islands to provide for the reciprocal legal tender of currency notes of the Government of Jamaica and the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean.

Development
Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955 the Windward Islands received an allocation of £3,250,000. This was sub-allocated to the various colonies as follows:

| Colony     | Allocation |
|------------|------------|
| St. Lucia  | £1,130,000 |
| Dominica   | £820,000   |
| Grenada    | £540,000   |
| St. Vincent| £540,000   |

A sum of £220,000 was reserved by the Governor for schemes covering more than one territory and for unforeseen contingencies.

Libraries, Museums, etc.
In each of the principal towns of the four Islands of the Group there is a free public library and there are several branch libraries throughout the Islands, all maintained by Government. The Dominica Museum, the only one in the Windward Islands, possesses a fine collection of pictures, specimens of birds and fishes and relics of the original Caribs.
Health

The principal diseases are malaria, enteric fever, helminthic diseases, yaws, venereal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis and dysentery.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, in co-operation with the World Health Organization, have made grants towards the implementation of insect control programmes in St. Lucia and Grenada. Applications have been submitted for the carrying out of similar projects in Dominica and St. Vincent.

Communications

Airfields have been constructed in Grenada and St. Lucia, and these two colonies are served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule. A temporary service with Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft is operated by the St. Vincent Government between Trinidad, Grenada, Carriacou, Barbados, St. Vincent and Dominica.

Broadcasting

The Windward Islands Broadcasting Service, with headquarters in St. George's, Grenada, was inaugurated in 1955. Transmissions take place on short-waves from a 5-kW. transmitter, and cover all four Islands.

The capital outlay on these stations, and the running costs for the first few years, have been provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Dominica

Area and Population

The area is approximately 305 square miles, and the estimated population at the end of 1957 was 65,890.

Geographical Features

Dominica is very mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island. The island is well-watered.

Climate

The climate on the whole is good; during the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

History

Dominica was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd July, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1761, and by the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the garrison. In 1783 it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

Until 1940 Dominica was grouped with the Leeward Islands.

Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March 1956. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council is the "principal instrument of policy" and the Governor and Administrator will normally accept the Council's advice unless they deem it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.
(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, comprises three *ex officio* members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he, however, has no vote. Since the President has a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator has no original vote, the elected members thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

- The Minister of Trade and Production;
- The Minister of Communications and Works;
- The Minister of Social Services;

each of whom is responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of any member of the Civil Service is the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, advised by a non-political Public Service Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two *ex officio* members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

**Taxation**

The main heads of taxation are income tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 2d. to 10s. in the £ of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 6s. on every £ of chargeable income. *Ad valorem* duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 5% to 35% preferential and 3% to 75% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Export duty, at a varying rate, is payable on most products exported. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars and black leaf tobacco.

Grenada

Area

The total area of the Colony is 133 square miles. In addition to the island of Grenada it includes certain of the small islands known as the Grenadines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area of about 13 square miles.

Population

The estimated population (1957) of 90,852 is for the most part coloured. There is a small white population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers.

Geographical Features

In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat disordered topography of mountains and fairly deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of mountains traverses the whole length, closer to the western than the eastern coastline. The highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), Fedon’s Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along the east and south-east the mountains slope gradually towards the sea. The south coast is deeply indented by numerous natural harbours. The island is well-watered by quick-flowing streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approximately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800 feet in the centre of the Island.

Climate

Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month, and November the wettest.

History

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. Grenada was, however, included in the Carlisle Grant of 1627. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased the island from the French West India Company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George’s. This venture did not pay and Du Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac from whom it was in turn purchased in 1665 by the French Company and passed to the Crown of France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 and re-occupied in 1784. In 1795–96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. The rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there has been peace in Grenada.

Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council is recognised as the “principal instrument of policy” and the Governor and Administrator normally accept the Council’s advice unless they deem it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, comprises three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor’s absence, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he, however, has no vote. Since the President has a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator has no original vote, the elected members thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.
(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

The Minister for Trade and Production;
The Minister for Communications and Works;
The Minister for Social Services;

each of whom is responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of any member of the Civil Service is the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, advised by a non-political Public Service Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage. General elections under the new constitution were held for the first time in September, 1957.

Taxation

Forms of direct taxation include income tax, estate duties and land and house tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale of 3 cents to 65 cents in the $ for individuals, companies paying a special rate of 37½ cents in the $. An agreement was reached in 1949 with various Governments for the avoidance of double taxation. Taxation is enforced in other forms through import, export and excise duties, licences, etc.

| Year | Revenue $ B.W.I. | Expenditure $ B.W.I. |

At the end of 1957 the Public Debt amounted to $7,798,612 (including a Hurricane Rehabilitation Loan from the United Kingdom Government of $4,951,190) and accumulated Sinking Funds to $1,071,847.

The main sources of revenue in 1957 were Import Duties $1,634,649, Export Duties $513,018, Taxes $735,813, and Excise Duties $287,373.

In the same year the estimated main heads of expenditure were Medical and Sanitary $709,027, Education $627,201, Police $368,184, Public Works (including Water and Roads) $873,339 and Agriculture $228,732.

Development Plans

Under the 1945 and 1950 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts Grenada received allocations totalling £591,121; a further allocation of £540,000 was made under the 1955 Act. By 31st March 1957 some £867,113 of the total of £1,131,121 had been committed to approved schemes, the balance being earmarked for the following services:

| Service          | Amount |

| Expenses of Loan                 | $40,304 |

Total $1,540,800

Other Development

Progress has been made in the direction of attracting external investment in a major development Tourist Scheme which the Colony is not in a position to finance. A step forward has also been made in setting out Government's policy regarding Morne Rouge development in the interests of tourism.

Education

There are 54 Primary Schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 19,487 pupils at 31st December, 1957. Average attendance in 1957 was 15,304 or 78·5% of the total enrolment. Compulsory attendance is enforced throughout Grenada (but not as yet in Carriacou and Petit Martinique). Eleven of the Primary Schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned buildings of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are two handicraft centres. In addition three schools have well-equipped handicraft rooms. There are also three domestic science centres, with adequate facilities provided at two other schools. A visual education unit serves the whole Colony. A filmstrip library service with four projectors is maintained. Six Secondary Schools (one Government and five grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,399 (end 1957). Two of the schools are for boys only, three for girls only and one is co-educational. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate standard and the Grenada Boys' Secondary School, the Presentation Boys' College, the St. Joseph's Convent, St. George's, and the Anglican High School also prepare pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1957 was $627,202. In 1935 the total expenditure on education amounted to $73,080.
The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships, one tenable at a University in the British Commonwealth, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture.

**Health**

A WHO assisted Campaign for the eradication of *Aedes aegypti* has been in operation since 1953 and is well on the way to success, the mainland of Grenada being free for the past two years. A programme for the control of malaria which was incorporated in the 1953 programme for *aegypti* eradication was expanded in 1957 to a malaria eradication programme. There has been a marked reduction in the incidence of malaria which was always restricted to well outlined areas in the Colony.

The WHO-UNICEF also assisted with the B.C.G. campaign in 1954 and with follow-up in 1955 and 1956 and subsequent incorporation of the programme into the normal activities of the Health Department; also with a scheme for the supplementary feeding of children, expectant and nursing mothers.

In 1956 a treponematosis campaign was undertaken with the object of eradication of yaws and a reduction in the incidence of venereal diseases. Evaluation and surveillance which have been continuing since then have shown that yaws is reduced to negligible proportions and by the end of this year it is hoped that the disease will be completely eliminated.

The Colony Hospital of 200 beds is at St. George's. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew's, is a modern building, recently constructed, and provides 32 beds. The district hospital in Carriacou which was completely destroyed by the hurricane of 22nd September, 1955, has been rebuilt and was opened on 16th July, 1958.

There are 25 district Medical Visiting Stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Maternity and child welfare work is carried on in all these Stations. There are two main Health Centres at St. George's and Gouyave, and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.

Expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1957 amounted to $709,027 compared with $97,987 in 1935.

**Communications**

The airfield is at Pearls, and has a runway 5,280 feet long and 150 feet wide.

There are approximately 479 miles of good roads divided into four classes according to standard of construction. About 256 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.

The chief ports are St. George's which possesses a good harbour, and Grenville; and in Carriacou, Hillsborough. Reconstruction of the deep-water pier destroyed by the hurricane of September, 1955, began in September, 1957. Cargo services are operated by the Harrison Line steamers from the United Kingdom, Saguenay Steamship Line from Canada, Three Bays Incorporated Steamship Line from Miami, Lamport and Holt Line Ltd. from Montreal and New York, American Defence Line from Miami and Pensacola; Royal Netherlands Steamship Company from Amsterdam and New York; the French Line (optional); and the Federal Inter-island Steamship Service. The Caribbean Fruit Company boats also carry passengers. Several small motor auxiliary and sailing vessels ply regularly between the islands.

The main crops are cocoa, nutmegs, mace, bananas, coconuts, limes and sugar cane.

The approximate livestock population is:

- Cattle: 10,000
- Equines: 5,000
- Sheep and Goats: 10,000
- Pigs: 9,500
- Poultry: 100,000

There is a cigarette factory, a soap and edible fats factory, and a sugar factory producing unrefined sugar for local consumption. The sugar factory also operates a continuous rum-distilling plant and together with a number of estates equipped with pot stills, supplies the demand for uncured rum. A lime factory and two estate equipped lime stills deal with the Island's lime crop. There is also a Government-operated cotton ginnery in Carriacou. One estate in Grenada manufactures and exports nutmeg oil.

Nutmeg estates, coconut trees, breadfruit trees and bananas suffered heavy damage and destruction in the hurricane in September, 1955, and the effect of the hurricane will be felt for many years to come. An estimated 95% of the nutmegs were destroyed and most of the cocoa entirely stripped of leaves, flowers and fruit. As nutmegs and cocoa are the major export crops, the magnitude of Grenada's long-term problem becomes apparent. Considerable progress has, however, been made in rehabilitating agricultural holdings.

The chief imports are foodstuffs, iron and steel, timber, textiles and cement.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Government-operated Central Marketing Organization was initiated in 1951 for the purchase, sale and, where necessary, storage of surplus quantities of locally grown foodcrops. The nutmeg industry is controlled by the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association which purchases, processes and markets all nutmegs and mace produced in the Colony.

Six fishermen's unions were registered under the Friendly Societies Ordinance in 1954.

In 1955 a statutory body, the Grenada Banana Co-operative Society, was set up to control the production and marketing of bananas.

A Co-operative Department was established in 1957. It now consists of a Registrar of Co-operatives, a Co-operatives Officer and two clerks. The Department is responsible for promotion work as well as registration, supervision and audit.

The position of societies registered under the Co-operatives Ordinance so far is as follows:

- Marketing Societies: 8
- Credit Unions: 5
- Credit Union League: 1

A recent amendment of the Co-operatives Ordinance permits the registration of school savings unions; 30 of these are already in operation.

St. Lucia

Area and Population

According to recent aerial surveys, the area is about 238 square miles. The population at the end of 1957 was estimated at 91,102.

Principal Towns

| Town         | Population |
|--------------|------------|
| Castries     | 25,000     |
| Soufrière     | 4,100      |
| Vieux Fort    | 3,900      |

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, with magnificent scenery. The highest peak is Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet); the most spectacular are the Gros Piton
(2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September-October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

History

Neither the date of discovery, nor the discoverer, of St. Lucia is known, for according to the evidence of Columbus’s voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L’Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d’Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d’Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April, 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June, 1803, was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council is the “principal instrument of policy” and the Governor and Administrator normally accept the Council’s advice unless they deem it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, comprises three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor’s absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he, however, has no vote. Since the President has a casting vote only and, whenever the Governor is present the Administrator has no original vote, the elected members thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

The Minister for Trade and Production;
The Minister for Communications and Works;
The Minister for Social Services;
each of whom is responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.
The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of any member of the Civil Service is the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, advised by a non-political Public Service Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 8d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

Development Plans

Under the revised Development Plans submitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1955 against the new Colonial Development and Welfare Act allocation of $5,424,000 to the Colony, provision is made both for the continuation of projects commenced in 1954 following the recommendations of a Team of Experts as well as several new items. The programme provides for expenditure in the following proportions:

- Communications: 39%
- Economic Development: 33%
- Social Services: 28%

Education

There are two Secondary Schools with 800 pupils on the roll, and 52 Primary Schools with a total of 17,482 pupils enrolled. The Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies conducted adult education classes throughout the year, and the aggregate attendance was 1,526. In the 1957-58 session there were 58 St. Lucia students at Universities in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

The total expenditure for 1957 was $568,507, compared with $32,122 in 1935.

Libraries

There is a Central Library in Castries and a branch library in Soufrière.

Health

The most prevalent diseases are heart diseases, diseases of early infancy, tuberculosis, helminthic diseases, and venereal diseases.

The incidence of malaria has fallen sharply as a result of an Insect Control Campaign carried out with W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. assistance.

Available hospital beds amount to 179 (general), 140 in the mental hospital, 20 in the leper home and 120 in a home for the aged and infirm.

In 1957, hospital in-patients numbered 6,612, and 57,406 persons attended at clinics or health outposts.

The expenditure on medical and allied services in 1957 was $477,637, compared with $55,795 in 1935.

Communications

There are two airfields, the Vigie Airport, and the Beane Field Airport. Air services with the other islands are maintained by British West Indian Airways Incorporated, and chartered flights by K.L.M. and British Guiana Airways.

The total mileage of the island's road system is 392.

Cargo steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, the Harrison Line, the Geest Industries Company and numerous inter-island craft are the main means of communication by sea. Castries handles about 1,000,000 gross tons of shipping annually.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture (20,000). Other gainful occupations are fishing (1,500), manufacturing (4,100), public services (1,200), lumbering (200), transportation (1,800), commerce (2,600), and domestic service (3,000).

There were five registered trade unions at the end of 1957.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar cane, bananas, coconuts, cocoa, cassava, fruit, vegetables, rice, cotton, and citrus.

Livestock estimates are: cattle 15,000, pigs 20,000, sheep 9,000, goats 7,000, horses, mules and donkeys 1,500, poultry 45,000.

Timber extraction was over 1,000,000 board feet in 1957.

There is a fair amount of fishing, but the supply of fish does not meet the demand.

The principal manufactures are sugar, rum, citrus products, edible oils, cotton ginning, cigarettes, and mineral waters.

St. Vincent

Area

The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population

The estimated population at the end of 1957 was 80,781.

Geographical Features

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufrière (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 87 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At Kingstown, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 85·8°, and the rainfall 95·72 inches, in 1956.

History

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should
be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent, and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British fourteen years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in 1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

**Constitution**

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956:

(a) The Executive Council is the "principal instrument of policy" and the Governor and Administrator normally accept the Council's advice unless they deem it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, comprises three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he, however, has no vote. Since the President has a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator has no original vote, the elected members thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

- The Minister for Trade and Production;
- The Minister for Communications and Works;
- The Minister for Social Services;

each of whom is responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of any member of the Civil Service is the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, advised by a non-political Public Service Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

**Taxation**

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 65 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 37½ cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 18s. 2d. per proof gallon.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | $489,677 | $464,458    |
| 1953 | $2,790,712 | $2,618,773 |
| 1954 | $3,061,693 | $2,846,026 |
| 1955 | $3,327,388 | $3,312,883 |
| 1956 | $3,228,244 | $3,794,934 |
| 1957 | $4,398,982 | $4,379,287 |

In 1957 Customs and Excise duties produced $1,558,353 (or 36·11%) of the total revenue while direct taxation yielded $408,198 (or 9·28%). In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Medical: $473,631
- Education: $405,909
- Police: $220,577

The Public Debt at 31st December, 1957, was $670,559, equivalent to $8·03 per head of the population.

**Development Plans**

The Ten-Year Development Plan, compiled in 1946, has been revised and replaced by the Five-Year Plan, 1955–60. It is hoped that the sum of £360,000 will be made available from public loans, and some £600,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds (including a further allocation of £540,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act). These funds will be spent in the following proportions:

- Communications: 65%
- Social Services: 24%
- Economic Development: 11%

**Education**

In 1957 there were two Government Secondary Schools and one grant-aided Secondary School with an enrolment of 606 pupils and 48 Primary Schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 18,855 pupils. There was also one unaided Secondary School. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions. Three Government teacher-training establishments have a total enrolment of 258 pupils.

During 1956–57 some 40 St. Vincent students were attending Universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1957 expenditure on educational services amounted to $405,909. The contribution of the United Kingdom under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $3,922. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.
Health

Of tropical diseases yaws, which was prevalent, has been almost completely eliminated. Tuberculosis is a major health problem but does not appear to be increasing (average deaths over a five-year period were 28 annually). Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 20 dispensaries. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery) .. 150
- Maternity .. .. .. 32
- Tuberculosis .. .. .. 40
- Mental .. .. .. 100
- Leprosy .. .. .. 20
- Pauper Home .. .. .. 125

In 1957 in-patients numbered 4,226; out-patients, 10,655.

Total expenditure in 1957 on Government Health and Medical Services was $473,631; in 1935, $66,945.

Communications

The Seadrome is situated at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown.

There are about 403 miles of road of which some 130 miles are motorable throughout the year; 100 miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 303 miles of metalled roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly cargo and passenger service is provided by two Federation ships travelling alternately via the islands as far north as Jamaica, and south to Trinidad. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service every six weeks by the Harrison Line. Geest Industries Steamships call weekly taking shipments of bananas to the United Kingdom. The Saguenay Line's steamships call southbound from Canada via the islands fortnightly, and return approximately every four weeks northbound. The Royal Netherlands Steamship Company operates a cargo service once monthly, northbound. Motor vessels and schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

Principal Occupations

The working population is estimated to be some 33,500, about 50% of whom are engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.

Trade Unions

| Trade Union                                      | Membership |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers' Union | 1,855      |
| The Civil Service Association                    | 184        |
| The Teachers' Association                        | 200        |
| The Secondary School Teachers' Association       | 22         |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are arrowroot, cotton, copra and coconut, sugar, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, bananas and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is:
- goats 11,000;
- cattle 7,750;
- sheep 3,300;
- horses and mules 250;
- swine 9,400.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

There is fairly extensive fishing in-shore but very little is done off-shore. Catches are often insufficient to meet demand.

A Central Arrowroot Factory with modern equipment has been erected. There are a good many privately-owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a soap and cigarette factory; an oil expressing and refining plant for cotton seed and coconut oil, with their by-products of stock feed and manure; and a deodorizing plant for the treatment of coconut and fish oils at the Government Cotton Ginney; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks.
