TANGANYIKA

Area

The total area of the territory is 362,688 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of inland water. The land area (in square miles) of the eight Provinces into which the Territory is divided is as follows: Central 36,410, Eastern 42,094, Lake 39,134, Northern 32,165, Southern 55,223, Southern Highlands 45,472, Tanga 13,803 and Western 78,405.

Population

The 1957 census showed that there were 8,665,000 Africans, 20,500 Europeans, 76,500 Indians and Goans, 19,000 Arabs and 7,000 others—total non-African population 123,000. Among the Africans some 120 tribes can be distinguished. Some of these number only a few thousand persons, while the largest tribe in the Territory, the Sukuma, represents 13% of the African population and numbers over one million. Other large tribes in numerical order are the Nyamwezi, Makonde, Haya, Chagga, Gogo and Ha. The ten largest tribes together comprise 43% of the African population.

Geographical Features

The two extremes of topographical relief of the whole continent of Africa lie within the boundaries of the Territory—Kilimanjaro, with a permanent ice-cap, rising to 19,340 feet above sea-level, and the deep trough-like depression filled by the waters of Lake Tanganyika, the world’s second deepest lake. Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to the great central plateau, which for the most part maintains an altitude of some 4,000 feet, is sharply defined along both its eastern and western margins by a series of steep-sided and deeply eroded escarpments, and falls sharply to the west to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika 2,534 feet; Nyasa 1,568 feet)* which lie in the trough of the great Rift Valley. Along both the eastern and western escarpment edges the plateau has been elevated to form long but relatively narrow belts of high country, rising in several places to over 7,000 feet. In the west this belt is cut by the valley of the Malagarasi River. This valley provides a drainage outlet to Lake Tanganyika from a large part of the central plateau, and thus extends the Congo-Atlantic drainage basin to within about 350 miles of the Indian Ocean. The escarpment to the east of Lake Nyasa is broken by the Ruhuhu River. The valley of the Ruhuhu is of importance as forming possibly the only practical alignment for a rail connexion between the coast and Lake Nyasa. Approximately half of the two great lakes, Victoria and Tanganyika, lie within the Territory’s borders, and lakes Natron, Manyara, Eyasi (in the north) and Rukwa (in the southwest) account for most of the remainder of the 20,000 square miles of inland water.

Climate

Roughly, three climatic zones can be distinguished:

(i) The coast region and immediately adjoining hinterland—tropical, temperature seldom below 80° during October–May, when the two rainy seasons occur; between June and September it is much cooler; average temperature 76°; average rainfall 40 inches.

(ii) The central plateau, altitudes 2,000–4,000 feet—prevailing characteristics low humidity, rainfall 20–40 inches annually, mean temperature over 70° with great daily and seasonal variations, sometimes exceeding 30° daily; nights almost invariably cool.

(iii) The semi-temperate regions round the slopes of Kilimanjaro (19,340 feet) and Meru (14,979 feet) to the north of the Territory, the “Winter Highlands” further west, the Usambara and Pare Highlands in the north-east, the Fipa Plateau in the south-west, and the mountainous areas to the north and east of Lake Nyasa (5,000 to 10,000 feet); frosts at higher altitudes, nights cold.

Generally speaking, the rainfall is low for a tropical country. Except for the northern and middle sections of the coastal belt, where the advent of the rain is dependent on the south-east and the north-east monsoon currents, and the areas around Lake Victoria and the north of Lake Nyasa—where there are two distinct rainy seasons—the greater part of the Territory has generally a one-season rainfall, beginning in November or December and continuing more or less unbrokenly to the end of April or May.

History

The country now known as Tanganyika came under German influence largely through the initiative of Dr. Karl Peters. In 1884 he journeyed into the interior and concluded twelve treaties with chiefs whose chiefdoms were then declared to be German territory. In 1885 the land he had acquired was placed under the protection of the Imperial German Government. A ten-mile belt along the coast was regarded as belonging to Zanzibar, but in 1888 Germany acquired the right of collecting duties on the coast and in 1890 took over the coastal strip on payment of £200,000 to the Sultan of Zanzibar. For some time after their acquisition of the territory the Germans were engaged in quelling risings, and in 1905 there broke out a serious rebellion, known

*Lake Victoria is 3,717 feet above sea level.
as the "maji-maji" rising, in the southern areas and extending from Lake Nyasa in the interior to Kilwa on the coast.

Soon after the outbreak of the 1914-18 war clashes took place between British and German forces on the northern frontier of the Territory, but the serious attempt to occupy the country did not begin until 1916. By the end of that year all the country north of the Central Railway was occupied by British or Belgian forces and a provisional Civil Administration was established for that area on the 1st January, 1917. In November 1917 the German forces were driven across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese East Africa and the occupation of the whole of the Territory was then completed. By the Treaty of Peace with Germany, signed at Versailles in 1919, Germany renounced in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights over her overseas possessions, including her East African colony. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that His Britannic Majesty should exercise a mandate to administer this former German colony, except for the areas of Ruanda and Urundi, for which the mandate was given to the Belgian Government. In 1920 the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Territory was constituted. Since then the administration of the Territory has continued to be carried out under the terms of the mandate until the establishment of the Trusteeship System under the Charter of the United Nations.

**Constitution**

The basis of the administration of the Territory in international constitutional law is the Trusteeship Agreement approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1946. The basis of the administration in demotic constitutional law is in Orders in Council under the United Kingdom Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890.

The Territory is administered by the Governor assisted by an Executive Council consisting of 16 members, of whom nine are Ministers (at present all officials) and seven are unofficials. Three of the Ministers sit as *ex officio* members, while the remaining six Ministers and seven unofficial members are nominated.

In 1957 the Legislative Council Elections Ordinance was passed. The Territory is divided into ten constituencies and elections were held in five of the constituencies in September, 1958 and will be held in the remainder in February, 1959.

The Legislative Council, which is presided over by a Speaker, consists of 67 members, 34 of whom form the Government side and the remaining 33 the Representative side. The nine Ministers are *ex officio* members on the Government side. There are also a number (at present four) of nominated unofficial Assistant Ministers (one of whom is also an unofficial member of Executive Council). The remaining members on the Government side are for the most part nominated unofficials (including four of the unofficial members of Executive Council) with a small number of nominated heads of departments. The racial division of the members representing constituencies is ten Africans, ten Asians and ten Europeans (all of whom are elected), one of each race to represent each of the ten constituencies. There are also three appointed members (one of each race) representing general territorial interests.

**Land Policy**

Subject to the validity of any title to land or any interest therein lawfully acquired before the 26th January, 1923, the whole of the lands of the Territory, whether occupied or unoccupied on that date, were declared to be public lands under the control of and subject to the disposition of the Governor, to be held and administered by him for the use and common benefit, direct or indirect, of the natives of the Territory. No title to the occupation and use of any such lands is valid without the consent of the Governor who, in the exercise of his powers, is obliged to have regard to native laws and customs. The only grants of freehold title which the Governor may make over public land are grants to give effect to a contract or undertaking by the former German Government, certain grants by way of exchange for freehold land acquired by the Governor, and grants to the Board of Trustees of the Tanganyika Higher Education Trust Fund. The Governor may, where it appears to him to be in the general interests of the Territory, make grants of Rights of Occupancy over public land to both native and non-native persons for terms not exceeding 99 years and subject to the payment of a suitable rental, revivable at intervals of not more than thirty-three years. Land lawfully used or occupied by a native or native community in accordance with native law and custom is deemed to be held on a Right of Occupancy.

**Taxation**

The tax system includes indirect taxation in the form of import, export and excise duties, stamp duties, and miscellaneous licence fees.

Particulars of direct taxation are set out below.

(a) **Personal Tax** is payable by all males over 18, irrespective of race: the rates are related to an individual's chargeable income. The minimum and maximum rates payable per annum are Shs. 12/- and Shs. 180/- respectively.

(b) **Non-Native Education Tax** is payable by every male non-native over 18 resident in the Territory, and assessed on Personal Tax payable.

(c) **Municipal House Tax** is levied on owners of houses in townships, not including native dwellings, at rates not exceeding 15% of the net annual value of the house. The tax is not leviable in those townships where local rates are in force.

(d) **Estate Duty** is payable at graduated rates on any deceased estate of a value exceeding £100.

(e) **Income Tax**—Resident individuals pay 2/- in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, 3/- in the £ on the next £400, 4/- in the £ on the next £400, 5/- in the £ on the next £400, 6/- in the £ on the next £400, 7/- in the £ on the next £500, 8/- in the £ on the next £500, 9/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 10/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 11/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 12/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 13/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 14/- in the £ on the next £1,000, and 15/- in the £ on every pound after £9,000.

Non-resident individuals pay at the rate of 2/- in the £ where the chargeable income does not exceed £800. Where it exceeds £800 the rates of tax as for residents apply. The chargeable income of individuals is calculated by deducting the total of personal allowances which can be claimed from the total income figure.

Limited Companies pay at the rate of Shs.5/50 in the £ on income as computed for Income Tax purposes.

Currency notes are issued in the following denominations: Sh. 5/-, Sh. 10/-, Sh. 20/-, Sh. 100/- and Sh. 1,000/-.

Development Plans

Since 1948 there has been a steady rate of development and it is anticipated that this development will continue at a rate of £4 million per annum of capital expenditure. The following figures are of interest in illustrating the development which has taken place in the past eight years:

| Year     | Expenditure* |
|----------|--------------|
| 1950     | £3,438,000   |
| 1951     | £3,830,000   |
| 1952     | £5,009,310   |
| 1953     | £3,699,000   |
| 1954 (First six months) | £1,600,785 |
| 1955     | £3,657,997   |
| 1956-57  | £6,480,956   |
| 1957-58  | £6,649,654   |

These funds come from a variety of sources but the main items are Loan Funds, Colonial Development and Welfare grants and contributions from Tanganyika Revenue.

The revised Development Plan covering the period July 1957 to June 1961 envisages expenditure of £26·9 million. Of this sum, 52% is for basic development—communications, public works and township services; 26% for the development of social services and urban housing; and 22% for the provision of increased agricultural productivity, rural water supplies, bush clearing and resettlement, forestry, veterinary and co-operative development training, research and extension work.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation's wattle plantations in the Njombe district now extend over an area of 33,000 acres.

The modified programme pursued by the Tanganyika Agricultural Corporation lays stress on such crops as velvet beans, soya beans, millet, and tobacco, in addition to groundnuts. Ranching is being undertaken at Kongwa and in an area near the Ruvu River some 50 miles west of Dar es Salaam.

Following on a preliminary reconnaissance by an F.A.O. expert in 1953, a survey of the Rufiji basin is being undertaken by the Tanganyika Agricultural Corporation, on behalf of the Tanganyika Government, assisted by a team of F.A.O. experts. The project is being financed mainly from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The object of the survey is to lay down the main lines of the development of the basin and to ensure that such development as is immediately possible is in line with the overall scheme. The first major step in development has been the initiation in 1958 of a scheme for irrigated tenant farming which will eventually cover some 5,000 acres.

The Mbeya Exploration Company, financed jointly by the Dutch firm of Billiton and the Colonial Development Corporation, has been granted a mining lease over the large pyrochlore deposits at Panda Hill in the Mbeya District in the Southern Highlands Province. A pilot mill has been erected for treatment tests of the ore of which large reserves have been proved.

The Kiabakari gold mine in the Musoma district owned by Tangold Mining Co., a company financed jointly by New Consolidated Gold Fields and the Corporation, is being developed, and by a drilling campaign the Corporation has proved a coal-field in the Kivira-Songwe area of the Rungwe District.

In the Northern Province New Consolidated Goldfields are proving a large phosphate deposit found as a result of aerial prospecting.

Education

Facilities for higher education are provided by the University College of Makerere at Kampala, Uganda, and at the Royal Technical College of East Africa, Nairobi. There are 184 students from Tanganyika at Makerere and 33 at the Royal Technical College.

There are about 292 students from Tanganyika receiving post-secondary education in the United Kingdom at the present time.

The system of African education provides for three stages up to secondary level; the Primary School Standards I-IV, the Middle School V-VIII.
and the Secondary School IX-XIII inclusive. In 1957 the number of pupils attending schools was as follows: Primary pupils 355,632; Middle school pupils 35,511; Secondary pupils 2,989; Teacher Training Centres 2,132; Technical and vocational training 1,121.

In 1957, eight Government Primary Schools, 16 assisted schools, nine unaided schools, together with a Government Correspondence Course, gave primary education to 2,404 European children and 341 received secondary education at one Government school and one assisted school, while about 650 received grants towards the cost of secondary education outside the territory.

Indian pupils numbering 15,339 attended three Government, 115 assisted and three unassisted primary schools; and 6,228 Indians received secondary education at five Government and 28 assisted schools. Another 947 non-Africans received primary education, and 325 secondary education, at assisted schools for other non-Africans including Goans.

Expenditure on educational services during 1957–58 (excluding £1,195,785 spent on capital works) amounted to £3,278,167. This total includes contributions amounting to £219,887 from Local Authorities and expenditure met from Non-Native Education Authority funds amounting to £812,145. In 1935 the total expenditure was £81,100.

Libraries

In Dar es Salaam there are the King George V Museum Library, the Arnautoglu Library which caters for all races and contains books in English, Swahili and Arabic, The British Council Library, and the High Court Library, which is open to all members of the Legal Department, to other serving officers of the Colonial Legal Service and to Advocates who have been admitted to practice in Her Majesty's High Court of Tanganyika and courts subordinate thereto.

The East African Literature Bureau runs postal and Book Box Services throughout the territory for African readers and the Social Development Department of the Tanganyika Government runs a combined book and cinema van and libraries at various community centres to serve Africans outside Dar es Salaam. In addition various schools, clubs and other institutions have libraries in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere.

Health

There are 586 out-patient dispensaries maintained by Native Authorities, four by Government, 132 by grant-earning missions and 287 by private bodies and industry. The Native Authorities maintain 170 maternity and child health clinics, Government 97 and missions 167. There are 19 major leprosaria of which some are maintained by Government and some by grant-aided missions. Government, missions and industrial concerns maintain a total of 206 hospitals and bedded dispensaries with 12,825 beds. During 1957, 252,082 in-patients and 15,548,299 out-patients were treated at Government and mission hospitals and dispensaries, and at Native Authority dispensaries.

Total estimated expenditure on medical and allied services in 1957–58 was £1,899,756. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £193,930. These figures exclude such items as medical building works provided for in the Public Works estimates and public health measures undertaken by the various township authorities or the expenditure on medical services by industry and voluntary agencies.

Communications

Air—The main airport is Dar es Salaam which has full customs and other facilities, and is designed to take aircraft up to Britannia class. Customs facilities are available on a request basis at Kigoma, Tabora, Mtwara, Mbeya and Tanga.

East African Airways Corporation operate scheduled services into Arusha, Dodoma, Iringa, Kilwa, Lindi, Mafia, Mombo, Mpanda, Mwanza, Nachingwea, Njombe, Songea and Sao Hill. In addition Dominion aircraft operate scheduled services into Bukoba, Geita and Musoma.

Passenger and freight services are operated on Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Administration and on Lake Nyasa by Nyasaland Railways Limited. These steamer services connect the railways of Tanganyika with those of Kenya and Uganda and the transport systems of the Belgian Congo, Ruanda Urundi and Northern Rhodesia.

Broadcasting

The Tanganyika Broadcasting Service was handed over on the 1st July, 1956 to an Independent Statutory Corporation which has full authority to develop the Service as it sees fit. The project, however, is still financed by means of a subvention from Government funds. Licences cost 10/- and in the first six months of 1958, 14,744 were issued. The transmitters (125kW, 5-0kW and 20kW) and studios are in Dar es Salaam.

Principal Occupations

Most of the self-employed indigenous inhabitants are engaged in agriculture. The numbers of African adult males employed (at a census held during the third quarter of 1956) are classified in the following major industrial groups:

| Industry                          | Number |
