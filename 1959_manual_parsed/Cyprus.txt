Geographical Features

The three main zones are:

(a) the Kyrenia range, which rises to a height of over 3,000 feet, running along the northern coast and terminating in the Karpas peninsula;

(b) the massif in the south-west of the island, of which the highest point is Mount Olympus (6,406 feet); and

(c) the central plain, known as the "Mesaoria".

Climate

The mean temperature (as recorded in Nicosia for the years 1916–1950) is 66·6°F.; mean maximum 78·3°F.; mean minimum 54·8°F.; highest shade temperature during that time, 112°F.; lowest, 23°F.; average rainfall for the last 12 years, 19·8 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole island. The climate is varied; hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the coast; on the hills inland it is bracing and healthy. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point on the plains and is mild on the coast, whilst the inland mountains are snow-covered for several weeks.

History

The history of Cyprus is long and eventful. In early historical times the island had been under the rule of Egypt, Persia, Rome and Byzantium. During the last named period its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. In 1191 Cyprus was conquered by Richard I of England following the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. From Richard the island passed to the Knights Templars, and later, when they found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, although the Genoese Republic held Famagusta from 1373 until 1464. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island and retained possession of it until its transfer to British administration.

On 4th June, 1878, a convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements" consented "to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England".

On 14th August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of 5th November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognized the annexation.

On 1st May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally made a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Constitution

Up to 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent of 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by Executive and Legislative Councils. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official members and 15 elected members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and 12 by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island, those clauses of the Letters Patent which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor. There is an Executive Council consisting, at present, of the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the Administrative Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

After the end of the last war several unsuccessful attempts were made by Her Majesty's Government to introduce constitutional government in the Island. On 19th June, 1958, Her Majesty's Government announced a seven-year plan. This plan, which envisaged co-operation with Greece
and Turkey, was rejected by Greece and accepted by Turkey.

On the 19th February, 1959, agreement was reached in London between the three Governments of Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom and the representatives of the two main communities in the island. The agreement provides for two areas to be retained under full British sovereignty, the integrity of which was guaranteed by the other parties to the agreement. Sovereignty over the remainder of the island was to be transferred to a new Republic of Cyprus, whose constitution was to come into force at the earliest practicable date. (See Cmnd. 679 and 680.)

**Land Policy**

Individual ownership of land is recognized and non-natives may acquire land. Except with the consent of the Governor, no alien may acquire, otherwise than by inheritance, ownership of any immovable property in the Colony. Compulsory acquisition of land may be made for purposes of public utility, with the consent of the Governor.

**Taxation**

Incomes which do not exceed £400 are exempted from income tax; where they exceed £400, however, tax is charged on the whole income in excess of £300. There is marginal relief on incomes between £401 and £425. Tax ranges from 50 mils for every £ in excess of £300 to 750 mils for every £ in excess of £6,000. A deduction of 10% is made from earned income before such income is charged to tax. Where the income of the wife is assessed on the husband the deduction of 10% is not extended to the income of the wife but a deduction is made equal to such income or £100 whichever is less. A deduction of £50 is made for each unmarried child under the age of 16 or (if over 16) receiving full-time instruction at an educational establishment. Where the child is between the ages of 11 and 25 and receiving full-time instruction outside the Colony, this deduction is increased to an amount not exceeding £250 in respect of expenditure incurred on the child's maintenance and education. Deductions are also made in respect of life insurance premiums and pension, provident fund and approved annuity contract contributions. In the case of bachelors and spinsters the tax payable is increased by 33½%, rising to 50% where the tax payable exceeds £90. The maximum additional "bachelor" tax is £500.

The tax on salaries, wages and pensions is collected under the system of Pay As You Earn. Companies and similar bodies pay a flat rate of 425 mils in the £ and deduct this tax from any dividends declared; credit is given to the shareholder for the tax thus deducted in calculating his personal tax liability. Arrangements for relief from double taxation exist with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and relief is also given if tax is payable on the same income in any of Her Majesty's possessions where reciprocal relief is given. By an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom and the Greek Government there is reciprocal exemption of air transport profits between Cyprus and Greece.

Estate duty is levied on the estate of any deceased person which exceeds £2,000 in value. The rates of estate duty are not fixed on a percentage basis in the case of estates of £15,000 in value and under. Such estates are divided into categories and the rates are specific amounts chargeable on each category. The specific amounts so chargeable range from £40 on estates between £2,000 and £2,500 in value to £1,615 on estates between £14,000 and £15,000 in value. In the case of estates in excess of £15,000 in value a percentage is imposed. This percentage is levied by "layers" and ranges between 21% and 30% on that part of the estate which exceeds £15,000 in value. Relief is given in respect of quick succession where the estate consists of immovable property or a business, and for estate duty paid in respect of the same estate in any country of the British Commonwealth.

Government in the United Kingdom, £5,483,926 to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, £1,500,000 to the Grain Commission, £1,499,915 to the Cyprus Inland Telecommunications Authority, and £7,382,905 for loans to local authorities, etc., in Cyprus.

Currency

Notes of the following denominations are in circulation:—£5, £1, 500 mils and 250 mils. (£ = 1,000 mils).

Coins in circulation:—
Cupro-nickel, 100 mils, 50 mils and 25 mils.
Bronze, 5 mils and 3 mils.

Development Plans

Development in Cyprus is financed from three sources: (1) the Development Fund, in accordance with a six-year Development Programme ending on the 31st December, 1961; (2) loans from the Public Loans Fund to public bodies for all kinds of works, the capital of the Fund being almost entirely obtained from annual appropriations from Revenue; (3) loans on the London market, or raised locally, which have hitherto only been raised for the central electrification and internal telecommunication schemes.

The balance of the new fund as at the 31st December, 1957, was approximately £2,923,000, and expenditure during 1957, the second year of the new programme, amounted to £3,628,000. The main items were:

| Item               | Amount |
|--------------------|--------|
| Agriculture        | £247,800 |
| Education          | £631,000 |
| Forests            | £54,500 |
| Harbours           | £187,000 |
| Medical            | £62,600 |
| Roads              | £560,800 |
| Rural Development  | £385,100 |
| Water Development  | £752,500 |
| Civil Aviation     | £57,000 |

No internal or external development loans were raised in 1957 and the Electricity and Telecommunications Authorities had to rely on temporary finance in the form of advances from Government until further loans can be raised.

In 1957 the Public Loans Fund issued 111 loans amounting to £659,000 to various public bodies for development works of all kinds.

Other Development

During 1957 the Electricity Authority of Cyprus extended its central steam electric generating station at Dhekelia and also built new 66,000 volt transmission lines to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity. New 11,000 volt transmission lines were constructed, and existing 11,000 volt lines were extended, to serve villages and irrigation and industrial consumers.

The capacity of the generating plant installed at Dhekelia Generating Station was increased from 42,750 kWs to 56,750 kWs and the output for 1957 was 146,817,500 units compared with 103,919,400 units in 1956.

Education

A new Teachers' Training College for men and women was opened in Nicosia in January 1958, and now accommodates 266 men students and 103 women students, all being trained for service in elementary schools.

There are 54 secondary schools with a total enrolment of 21,356 pupils and 727 elementary schools controlled by Government with a total enrolment of 79,133 pupils. Most secondary and elementary schools are co-educational and most of them take children only from one community. There are, however, a small number of secondary schools, a few of which have elementary sections, which take pupils from all communities.

The plan for the development of technical education in the Island has made great progress. Four new technical schools have been opened: a Preparatory Technical School for 240 boys in Nicosia, a Secondary Technical School for 900 boys in Limassol, a Craft Training School for 240 boys in Lefka, and a Technical Institute in Nicosia which in its final form will provide secondary and post-secondary education for 1,000 pupils.

Two post-elementary Rural Central Schools, one in Morphou for Greeks and one in Pergamos for Turks, provide education with a practical agricultural bias for the sons of the farming community.

A new Government secondary school for girls was opened in Nicosia in September, 1957.

Government controlled expenditure on education in 1957 amounted to £2,754,273 (of which £1,741,412 was from colonial revenue) compared with £121,986 in 1935.

Libraries and Museums

There are public libraries in Nicosia, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos, which are controlled by the Municipalities. A Turkish Public Library in Nicosia is maintained by the Cyprus Turkish Cultural Association. The Phaneromeni Library, also in Nicosia, has an important historical section. The Antiquities Department maintains a central archaeological museum and library in Nicosia, district museums in Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos and local museums in Famagusta, Episkopi (Curium) and Kouklia (Old Paphos).

Health

Cyprus is free from quarantinable diseases such as cholera, plague, louse-borne typhus and yellow fever. Smallpox has not occurred for many years nor has a primary case of malaria been reported since the successful conclusion of the anti-malaria campaign nine years ago. A W.H.O. survey showed that mass B.C.G. vaccination against tuberculosis was unnecessary in Cyprus. Poliomyelitis has increased in recent years, its incidence being mostly amongst infants and young children.

The Government hospitals (including two sanatoria, a mental hospital and a home for disabled) provided 1,529 beds in 1957. In addition there were 780 beds in 50 private hospitals, 115 beds in 13 rural hospitals and 102 beds in two mines hospitals. Out-patients (first attendances) at the six District Hospitals numbered 149,683; rural dispensaries dealt with 44,367 cases.

Expenditure by Government on medical and allied services was £810,630 in 1957 compared with £52,436 in 1935.

Communications

Air Communications with the following countries are maintained on a scheduled basis by Cyprus Airways Ltd., in conjunction with B.E.A.:—U.K. (London), Italy (Rome and Milan), Greece (Turkey (Ankara and Istanbul), Lebanon, Syria, Bahrain and Kuwait and Israel. Other scheduled airlines serving the Colony are: Olympic Airways...
Middle East Airlines, Air Liban, Turkish Airlines and Skyways Limited (Colonial coach class service). Nicosia is the only international airport in Cyprus. No internal air service network exists in the Colony.

The following table shows the roads, excluding Forest Department roads, which exist in the Colony:

| Roads Type                        | Miles |
|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Commissioners' roads (mostly gravel) | 1,736 |
| P.W.D. roads (gravel)              | 155   |
| P.W.D. roads (asphalt)             | 819   |
| Municipalities roads (gravel)      | 179   |
| Municipalities roads (asphalt)     | 223   |

Total: 3,112

The main ports in the Island are Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol. Famagusta has a harbour where vessels of an overall length of 425 feet and a maximum draught of 22½ feet can easily be berthed alongside the quay. Vessels at Larnaca and Limassol anchor in the open roadstead about 4-5 cables off the main jetty, and goods are transported to and from the shore by means of lighters.

Regular passenger services are run between Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean. Cargo ships of many nationalities—the most regular being vessels of the British Conference Lines (Mediterranean Section), some of which accept passengers—call at Cyprus ports, on voyages between British, Continental and Mediterranean ports, Mediterranean and Red Sea ports and U.S.A., Mediterranean and Black Sea ports.

There is no railway or inland waterway.

**Sound and Television Broadcasting**

In July, 1958, a Broadcasting Bill was published which, when enacted, would set up a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. The Corporation would consist of a Chairman and four other members and a Director-General, all appointed by the Governor. Under the terms of the Charter the Corporation would be entitled to accept commercial advertising both on sound and television. It would take over the functions now exercised by the Cyprus Broadcasting Service which is a Government Department.

There are two networks, Greek and Turkish, and medium wave transmitters are used to give island-wide coverage. The two main transmitters are situated at Athalassa, a few miles south of Nicosia, and have a power of 20 kW each. A transmitter (2 kW) relaying the Greek programmes is situated near Ktima, Paphos district, and a transmitter (250 W) relaying the Turkish programmes, is situated in Limassol. At certain times of the day a common programme in English is relayed by both networks. There are approximately 85,000 licence holders and the licence fee is £1 per annum.

A pilot television service for the Nicosia area commenced operating in October, 1957. International Radio Consultative Committee (C.C.I.R.) standards are employed and the effective radiated power is 1·5 kW. Programmes are transmitted three nights a week in Greek, Turkish and English.

**Principal Occupations**

The principal occupation is agriculture in which some 134,300 persons are employed. Approximate numbers in other occupations are:

- Building and Construction: 21,000
- Other manufacturing industries: 37,000
- Commerce, Public Administration, Transport and other Services: 63,000
- Mining: 6,000

At the end of 1957 there were three Employers’ Associations with 138 members, and 228 Workmen’s Unions with a membership of 52,465. Five Federations co-ordinating the activities of 203 such Workmen’s Unions, had a total membership of 44,093.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main agricultural products are wheat, barley, potatoes (two crops a year), onions, vegetables, legumes, linseed, hemp fibre, sesame, cumin, aniseed, tobacco, carobs (locust beans), almonds, olives, figs, citrus, deciduous fruits, pomegranates, vine products, cheese, wool, hides and skins.

The livestock population in 1957 was:

- Camels: 143
- Horses, mules and donkeys: 51,735
- Cattle: 28,406
- Sheep: 381,130
- Goats: 158,717
- Pigs: 39,209
- Poultry: 2,200,000 (Estimated)
- Rabbits: 100,000 (Estimated)

Timber production in 1957 was 1,601,000 cubic feet R.U.B. including 1,560,000 cubic feet of softwood (pine) and 41,000 cubic feet of hardwood timber. Firewood and charcoal production amounted to 578,000 and 5,000 cubic feet respectively. All these products were consumed in Cyprus.

Cyprus fisheries are not rich owing to the lack of nutrient salts, and the supply of fish is not equal to the demand. All the catch (396,240 okes* in 1957) is sold locally and consumed fresh.

The principal minerals are cupreous and iron pyrites and asbestos. Chromite, gypsum and terra umbra are also produced and exported.

Apart from the major industries of agriculture and mining and the newly erected cement plant, there are many light factory industries in Cyprus which are constantly expanding the variety and the quantity of their output. These may be classified as follows:

- **Food Products.**—Grain milling, bakery products, macaroni, canned fruit and vegetables, jams and marmalades, confectionery (including Turkish delight and sugared almonds), ice cream, animal fodder compounds, olive oil, edible seed oils, cheese making, coffee grinding, and packing fresh fruit and vegetables for export.

- **Beverages and Tobacco.**—Beer, wines, spirits, grape must, soft fruit drinks and cordials, cigarettes.

- **Textiles, Clothing and Footwear.**—Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles, hosiery, shirts, underwear, footwear, quilts, lace and embroidery.

---

* 5 okes = 1 stone.
Building Materials, etc.—Bricks, tiles, pottery, plaster and plasterboard, asbestos sheets, nails, earth colours.

Miscellaneous.—Locust bean gum, olive kernel oil, perfumery, essential oils, soap, detergents, crown corks, metal containers, motor bodies and carts, threshing machines, furniture, travel goods, baskets, brooms, buttons, artificial teeth, tyre retreading, printing and publishing, lithography, tannery, bottling of industrial gases.

Some of these are scarcely more than minor cottage industries but most of them operate under factory conditions. The poultry industry is expanding. Building activity during 1957 and the first half of 1958 continued at a high level.

New industries coming into production include a pyrites treatment plant; a mechanized ore-loading station for shipment of minerals; manufacture of cartons, refrigerator cabinets, industrial gas, and wire-netting; and flour milling. Extension to existing plants included additions to cold storage, cheese and confectionery manufacture and garage and motor repair facilities.

The chief imports are wheat, timber, mineral fuels and lubricants, manufactured fertilizers, cotton, silk and woollen manufactures, cement, iron and steel manufactures and machinery and transport equipment.

Tourist Trade

One of the results of terrorism is the continuous drop in the number of visitors to the Island. The value of the 1957 tourist traffic is estimated at £500,000, but is more than offset by the figure of £1,500,000 spent during 1957 by Cypriot tourists abroad.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are at present no Marketing Boards in Cyprus, but the Government, acting through an appointed Board set up under special legislation as the Grain Commission, is the sole purchaser of wheat and barley using as its agents the co-operative societies in the villages.

Under other legislation a Vine Products Scheme has been established with the Commissioner for Co-operative Development as Controller. This Scheme purchases all grape alcohol (zivania) from the producers and resells to manufacturers of wines and spirits at a price which is fixed from time to time. The Controller is advised by a Committee on which producers and manufacturers are represented. The same Scheme also purchases raisins offered voluntarily by producers at a safety price fixed by Government and then resells. The Scheme also assists in the payment of Government subsidies to producers of fresh grapes purchased by manufacturers.

The other form of organized marketing societies is that of the various co-operative marketing societies and unions which deal with substantial quantities of carobs, wines and spirits, potatoes, fresh and dried fruits. There are at present 883 co-operative societies of all types of which 498 are thrift and credit societies, 312 retail stores, 3 supply unions, 4 supply societies, 2 producers societies, 11 primary marketing, 8 marketing unions (5 for carobs, 2 for potatoes and one for vine products), 1 carob federation, 4 wine making, 14 olive pressing, 1 building for Government officials, 2 transport, 5 land leasing, 1 land purchase, 1 bee-keeping, 9 farming, 1 poultry producers, 1 agricultural machinery, 2 irrigation, 1 general, 1 cheesemaking and 1 Co-operative Central Bank. Membership of all societies now exceeds 160,000 and the funds used by the movement include £1,466,334 (1956) of share capital and reserves and £5,433,038 (1957) of deposits.
