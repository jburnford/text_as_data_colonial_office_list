KENYA

Area
The Colony and Protectorate of Kenya is bisected by the equator and extends approximately from latitude 4° N. to latitude 4° S. and from longitude 34° E. to 41° E.

The total area is 224,960 square miles (including 5,171 square miles of water).

Population
At 1st July, 1958, the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at some 6·4 million persons, of whom 6·1 million were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe       | Population |
|-------------|------------|
| Kikuyu      | 19·5%      |
| Luo         | 14·4%      |

| Meru        | 6·2%       |
| Nyika       | 5·6%       |

The total non-African population in mid-1958 has been estimated at 270,900:

| Group                  | Population |

Geographical Features
Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Teita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Kulal 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,058 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,120). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (3,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30-40 miles wide and 2,000-3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

Climate

The climate varies greatly. Three broad divisions exist:

1. The warm, moist coast;
2. The dry low plain, 300–2,000 feet, extending from the borders of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to the boundary of Tanganyika;
3. The Highlands, 3,000–10,000 feet, where rainfall, although variable in general, increases with altitude.

History

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Ethiopia in 1947 which will supersede the original agreement of 1907, when the demarcated frontier is ratified.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten sea miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which an annuity of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made in 1887 to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution

Under the Kenya (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, which came into operation on 5th April, 1958, and Royal Instructions of 3rd April, 1958, the Colony and Protectorate is administered by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, who is advised by a Council of Ministers. There is provision for 16 Ministers, of whom not more than eight and not less than six shall be public officers. Of the eight unofficial Ministerial posts, 4 are reserved at present for Europeans, 2 for Asians and 2 for Africans. There is also provision for not more than 6 Assistant Ministers who may be appointed by the Governor to assist the Ministers. The Governor's Personal Adviser on Arab Affairs has the right to attend and participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers.

The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker, appointed by the Governor; "Ex Officio Members", who are for the time being Ministers or Temporary Ministers, but not otherwise members of the Legislative Council; 36 Constituency Elected Members, of whom 14 are European, 14 African, 6 Asian (of whom 2 are Muslim) and 2 Arab; Speciality Elected Members, at present 12, elected by Legislative Council members sitting as an electoral college, of whom 4 are European, 4 African, 2 non-Muslim Asian, 1 a Muslim Asian and 1 an Arab; and Nominated Members, at present 32, nominated by the Governor.

A Council of State, designed to protect any community against harmful discriminatory legislation, has also been established under the Order and may consist of a chairman and not more than 16 and not less than 10 members. At present a chairman and 10 members have been appointed.

In the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly Kenya is represented by two Nominated and six Unofficial Members, two of the latter being European, two Asian, and two African.

The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Nyeri and various other places.

A General Election was held in September and October, 1956, for the European, Asian and Arab constituencies. In March, 1957, elections were held for the eight African members who were previously styled Representative members, and elections to six further African seats took place in March 1958.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by other Local Authorities. There are now 26 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local by-laws regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. Seven County Councils have been established under the Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, for the Nairobi, Nakuru, Naivasha, Aberdare, Nyanza, Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu Districts.

There are six municipal authorities established under the Municipalities Ordinance. The City of Nairobi and the Municipality of Nakuru are administered by Municipal Councils, and Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu and Kitale by Municipal Boards. The members of Eldoret, Kitale and Kisumu Municipal Boards are all nominated, but the other municipal authorities have elected as well as nominated members.

**Land Policy**

All land in Kenya, apart from a few freeholds, mainly around Nairobi and in the Protectorate, falls into one of two categories:

(a) Crown lands;

(b) Native lands.

"Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

"Native lands" are permanently reserved for Africans in so far as the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of the land are concerned and all the rights enjoyed under native laws and custom are preserved. Proposals are now being studied for the systematic registration of land interests in certain areas and the conversion thereby of ownership rights under native custom to freehold.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township or native reserve, is alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

**Taxation**

The forms of direct taxation which apply to all communities are income tax and personal tax. The maximum rate of personal tax in 1958 was Shs. 150/-. Under the Income Tax Acts generous personal allowances are given. The rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 2/- in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases gradually to a maximum rate of Shs. 15/- in the £ where the chargeable income exceeds £9,000. In addition, a surcharge of 75 cents is made on each £ of chargeable income in excess of £800. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/50 in the £. A graduated hospital tax calculated on total income is also payable by all Europeans.

In 1957-58, in addition to Colony expenditure of £32,987,982 mentioned above, issues from the Exchequer Account for expenditure on Development amounted to £8,020,022.

The Public Debt of Kenya at 30th June, 1957, was £50,365,201, made up as follows:

| Type of Debt          | Amount (£) |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Funded Debt           | 41,055,600 |
| Unfunded Debt         | 9,309,601  |

(of which £6,696,091 was raised for E.A. Railways and Harbours Administration).

Unfunded Debt... 9,309,601 (of which £3,000,000 was an interest-free loan from H.M.G. to assist with Emergency expenditure).

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also British Somaliland and Aden. The standard coin is the...
East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-), and Shs. 1/- (notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

Under the ten-year Development Programme, 1946-55, £38·8 million was allocated, of which £27·4 million was spent over the eight years 1946-53. Of this expenditure 45% was financed from loans, 24% from Colony revenue and 18% from various appropriated funds.

A new Development Programme covered the three and a half years, 1954-57, during which £21·7 million was spent, mainly from loan moneys, the balance in the Development Fund, and Colonial Development and Welfare grants. Other development expenditure outside the three-and-a-half-year programme amounted to £13·8 million during the same planning period, making a total of £35·5 million in all.

A further Development Programme is now in force for the three years 1957-60, under which it is proposed to bring all important development projects within the plan and spend £26·3 million as follows:

| Ministry                                      | Per cent. |

(c) Including the allocation for General Works Staff.

During the planning period, 1954-57, £4·0 million was spent on the Swynnerton Plan to Intensify the Development of African Agriculture. During the period 1957-60, it is proposed to allocate £6·7 million to the Swynnerton and Accelerated Swynnerton Plans, of which £1·3 million will be the balance of the original £5·0 million allocated as a Colonial Development and Welfare grant for the Swynnerton Plan, 1954-59.

Education (1957-58)

European. 45 primary schools (17 government, 16 aided, 12 unaided) with altogether 7,707 pupils, 14 secondary schools (5 government, 1 aided, 8 unaided) with altogether 2,783 pupils.

Asian. 121 primary schools (27 government, 87 aided, 7 unaided) with altogether 37,655 pupils, 22 secondary schools (8 government, 9 aided, 5 unaided) with altogether 5,188 pupils, 3 government teacher-training centres with altogether 218 students.

African. 3,888 primary and intermediate schools (20 government, 3,145 aided, 723 unaided) with altogether 500,266 pupils, 29 secondary schools (10 government, 11 aided, 4 unaided) with altogether 3,134 pupils, 41 teacher-training centres (9 government, 31 aided, 1 unaided) with altogether 3,070 students.

Arab and Others. 10 primary schools (8 government, 1 aided, 1 unaided) with altogether 2,341 pupils, 1 government secondary school with 144 pupils. The aided primary school has a secondary section with 16 pupils.

Higher Education

In 1957, 69 Kenya students were admitted to Makerere College in Uganda making a total of 251 in all from Kenya in residence.

The Royal Technical College of East Africa was opened in Nairobi in April, 1956. There are Faculties of Architecture, Arts, Science, Engineering and Commerce and a Department of Domestic Science; 157 Kenya students were admitted in 1957, of whom 120 enjoy bursaries, and 6 Asian Teachers' Scholarships.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education, usually in institutions overseas. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds allocated under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also a few scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly for local education, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for teachers to enable them to take degree and other courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts. Among other sources of funds to assist students in going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Government of India, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards made on the recommendation of a Committee for Study and Training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

In addition to these awards a new scheme has been started to assist in the higher education of Government servants which provides "Kenya Development Scholarships", open to Kenya Government servants of all races recommended by the Heads of their Departments, to pursue courses which will either improve their capacity as Government servants or fit them for promotion.

A new Educational Trust was formed by a private donor called the Maniben and Mohammedally Rattansi Educational Trust. In the terms of the Trust the income is divided into five equal parts for awards annually to Europeans, Africans, Muslims, non-Muslims and Ismailis. Twenty awards were made from this Trust to students of all races for studies in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere.

The total number of Kenya students in the United Kingdom for the academic session 1957-58 was 880. This number included 88 Africans (49 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 566 Asians (97 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), and 214 Europeans (65 with bursaries, scholarships or loans). There were 63 Africans in India and Pakistan during this period, 37 in the United States and Canada, and 11 in various other countries.
Trade and Technical Education

There were, in 1958, five Government Technical and Trade Schools for African boys, admitting students who had completed eight years of schooling, for a three or four-year course of training; in 1958, 1,157 indentured apprentices were receiving instruction in building, engineering, tailoring and leather-working trades. One hundred and four pupils who had completed one year of a trade course are taking a Secondary Technical course leading to the School Certificate examination. Ten pupils were admitted for a clerical course.

Vocational training was also given in two aided schools and at a number of unaided rural training centres. A number of Government Departments and the East African Railways and Harbours and Posts and Telegraphs Administrations, conducted training courses for students from the intermediate and secondary schools entering their service.

The Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education, which ranks as a Technical Institute, had 193 students enrolled in 1958.

There were two Asian Technical High Schools providing courses in technical and commercial subjects to School Certificate.

Government expenditure on education in 1957-58 was:

| Gross expenditure | £5,211,594 |
|-------------------|------------|
| Net expenditure   | £4,375,312 |
| Appropriations-in-aid | £836,282 |

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library and the Desai Memorial Library, both in Nairobi, and also the Seif bin Salim Public Library in Mombasa. The Government has a small library of general reference books and books on Africa.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Curator, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, is assisted by a staff of eight Europeans and eighteen Africans, with part-time assistance from two other Europeans.

Health

The principal causes of mortality are general infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory diseases, alimentary diseases, and allergic, metabolic and blood diseases in that order. A new line of action to meet the threat from tuberculosis has been worked out. Poliomyelitis has remained at its normal endemic levels.

In 1957 beds available in hospitals (including maternity homes but excluding beds in dispensaries and health centres) totalled 7,764. In-patients in Government Hospitals totalled 172,290, out-patients 1,034,209.

Total expenditure of the Medical Department on Hospitals and Health Services in the fiscal year 1956-57 was £1,854,228 compared with £435,942 in 1946.

Communications

East African Airways Corporation operates in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of charter aircraft-operating companies are based at Wilson Airport (formerly called Nairobi West).

With the opening of the new international Nairobi Airport at Embakasi in 1958, Eastleigh Airport ceased to operate and all the international services as well as East African Airways Corporation's internal services are operating from the new Airport. Wilson Airport will remain open for use by charter companies and private owners. There are 42 regional airfields in the territory.

Air Safety and Aeradio Services are provided by the Directorate of Civil Aviation, East Africa, and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. All air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the East Africa High Commission.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Aden and Madagascar.

There are approximately 24,500 miles of roads; only about 453 are bitumen surfaced. The main roads (3,710 miles, excluding Northern Frontier Province), where not bituminized, are gravel-surfaced and, for the most part, all-weather except during excessive rains. Secondary roads (5,114 miles) are mostly gravel-surfaced, but are more subject to closure to heavy traffic in wet weather. Considerable improvements in alignment and formation have been effected on the main roads, and many secondary roads, during recent years. The Great North Road (Cape Town to Cairo) through Kenya, from Namanga on the Tanganyika border in the south and via Nairobi, has been re-routed through Eldoret to Tororo on the Uganda border.

Broadcasting

Kenya was the first British Colonial Territory to have a regular public wireless broadcasting service. There are at present three broadcasting organizations in Nairobi:

(i) Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited provided services in the English and Asian languages under a Charter granted to them in 1931. This Charter expired in September, 1956, but by an agreement between the Company and the Government Cable and Wireless will continue English and Asian broadcasts for a further three years from that date, i.e. until 30th September, 1959.

(ii) The Kenya Government through its Department of Information operates Services for African listeners in Swahili and Kikamba. It is known as the African Broadcasting Service and transmits some 50 hours per week. The programmes are fed by land line to the Cable and Wireless transmitting site on the outskirts of the city where the transmitters for this service, owned by the Government, are maintained and operated by Cable and Wireless.

(iii) The Forces Broadcasting Station operates the service for British troops stationed within the Colony.

Outside Nairobi the Department of Information operates three regional stations for African and Arab listeners, that at Nyeri broadcasts in Kikuyu
and Kimeru, that at Kisumu broadcasts in the vernacular languages of Nyanza Province as well as in Swahili and that of Mombasa in Swahili and Arabic.

At present there are more than 25,000 licensed receiving sets in the Colony, and small wired broadcasting schemes in operation in Nairobi and Nakuru.

The Kenya Government invited the British Broadcasting Corporation to send a Commission to the Colony to recommend on the future of broadcasting. Based upon its reports, the Government has drawn up final plans for the future of broadcasting within the Colony. These make provision for the take-over (initially by a Government Department of Broadcasting) of all broadcasting services within the Colony, with the exception of the Forces Broadcasting Station, as from the 1st October, 1959.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. The numbers reported in employment in other occupations in 1957 are shown in the following table:

| Industry                                      | Africans | Asians | Europeans |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing             | 251,073 | 516    | 1,839     |
| Mining and Quarrying                         | 7,547   | 229    | 83        |
| Manufacturing and Repairs                     | 46,892  | 7,429  | 2,659     |
| Building and Construction                     | 20,173  | 3,305  | 701       |
| Electric Light, Power and Water Supply        | 1,920   | 344    | 228       |
| Commerce                                      | 22,707  | 10,122 | 3,943     |
| Transport and Communications                 | 12,944  | 1,808  | 976       |
| Domestic Service                              | 25,792  | 113    | 66        |
| Public Services (including Railways)          | 146,894 | 10,839 | 9,192     |
| Other Services                                | 18,856  | 2,461  | 2,744     |
| **All Industries and Services**               | **554,798** | **37,166** | **22,431** |

In December, 1957, 24 employees' and 7 employers' unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total membership of employees' unions, as shown on the 1957 returns, is 41,497. It is estimated that "voting membership" is considerably less than half that figure.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops and products are coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum, wattle bark and extract, sodium carbonate, meat, butter, ghee and cheese, hides and skins, maize, wheat and cotton.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony's timber supplies—softwoods such as *Podocarpus* and East African pencil cedar and various hardwoods, of which East African olive and East African camphor are those in greatest demand. Forest produce from the established plantations is becoming available in increasing quantities and supplied 25% of the total sales of logs from the Forest Estate during 1957. The trade in mangrove poles from the coastal areas is still a substantial one, but there are signs that it is likely to decline. Attention is being directed towards the building up of an export trade in charcoal to counteract the loss in the demand for poles.

Fishing is carried on both at the Coast and in Lake Victoria. The marine fisheries are, however, still in an early stage of development and do not provide an adequate supply of fish throughout the year.

The chief minerals in order of value covering the year 1957 were sodium carbonate, copper cement, salt, gold, limestone, diatomite, graphite, carbon dioxide, gypsum. The total value of minerals won during 1957 was £2,351,520.

There are in operation in the Colony over 100 main types of manufacturing and industrial concerns which produce goods both for internal consumption and export. The chief products are:

- Acetylene, aluminium hollow-ware, bacon and pork products, biscuits, butter, beer, canned foodstuffs, carbon dioxide and dry ice, cheese, coffee, cement, cigarettes, diatomite products, dried milk, essential oils, fancy leather goods, footwear, folding spring beds, furniture and joinery, glassware and bottles, hydrogenated oils, hides and skins, hurricane lanterns, kyanite, margarine and vegetable fats, meat products, metal containers, mineral waters, preserved fruit and fruit preparations, passion fruit juice and pulp, pineapple juice, parquet flooring blocks, pyrethrum extract, pencil slats, sisal products, salt, sodium carbonate, sugar, tea, tanned leather, wattle extract and bark, meer-schaum pipes, wheat, maize flour, and brewers malt.

An ever-increasing export trade is enjoyed by African curios and carvings which command a ready market in the United Kingdom, United States, Mexico, Canada, and Australia.

(Including bullion and specie, excluding all interterritorial transfers of domestic produce to Uganda and Tanganyika.)

In 1957, 37.7% of total direct imports came from the United Kingdom, 18.0% from other Commonwealth countries, and 38.5% from foreign countries; postal packages and special transactions accounted for 5.8%.

In 1957, 25.5% of domestic exports went to the United Kingdom, 21.3% to other Commonwealth countries, and 52.5% to foreign countries; 7.7% exported as ships' and aircraft stores.

Tourist Trade

Kenya's tourist trade is now worth not less than £7½ million per annum and ranks as its second "export". Visitors entering Kenya during 1957 numbered 39,900, compared with 29,633 in 1953.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

On 31st December, 1957, there were 466 registered co-operative societies, with a total membership of 93,000. Of these, 425 were marketing societies, which handled produce to the value of £22,000,000 during the year.
